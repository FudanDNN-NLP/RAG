Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste. At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease. COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles containing the virus. Several testing methods have been developed to diagnose the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by detection of the virus's nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) from a nasopharyngeal swab. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Nomenclature During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\" and \"Wuhan coronavirus\", with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East respiratory syndrome, and Zika virus. The official names COVID‑19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020. The WHO additionally uses \"the COVID‑19 virus\" and \"the virus responsible for COVID‑19\" in public communications. Signs and symptoms Cause COVID‑19 is caused by infection with a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Transmission Virology Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. It was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan. All structural features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus particle occur in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubble. Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains. It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13). The structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include membrane glycoprotein (M), envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid protein (N), and the spike protein (S). SARS-CoV-2 variants The many thousands of SARS-CoV-2 variants are grouped into either clades or lineages. Pathophysiology The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID‑19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a \"spike\" to connect to the ACE2 receptor and enter the host cell. It is clear that many people with COVID-19 exhibit neurological or mental health issues. The virus is not detected in the CNS of the majority of COVID-19 patients with neurological issues. However, SARS-CoV-2 has been detected at low levels in the brains of those who have died from COVID‑19, but these results need to be confirmed. While virus has been detected in cerebrospinal fluid of autopsies, the exact mechanism by which it invades the CNS remains unclear and may first involve invasion of peripheral nerves given the low levels of ACE2 in the brain. The virus may also enter the bloodstream from the lungs and cross the blood-brain barrier to gain access to the CNS, possibly within an infected white blood cell. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. However, people transferred to \n\n British scientists, and British government officials have expressed doubts about the accuracy of the figures provided by the Chinese government relating to the epidemic, raising concerns that the Beijing government has deliberately under-reported the extent of infections and deaths. Asymptomatic cases (people who tested positive but did not develop symptoms) were not counted as confirmed cases before 1 March. During the pandemic, no reports of cases of the COVID-19 in Xinjiang prisons or of conditions in \n\n Xinjiang re-education camps emerged. Caixin also reported that there were a number of people who died with COVID-19 symptoms but were not tested and were thus excluded from the official case-tally.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the trial, which was sponsored by Forum, 319 schizophrenia patients were randomized to receive either encenicline in one of two doses daily, or a placebo, for 12 weeks. Patients in both encenicline dose groups showed significant cognitive improvement based on various measures, according to a presentation made late last month at the 15th International Congress on Schizophrenia Research. “These data shows that pro-cognitive effects in schizophrenia were observed for encenicline as assessed by two independent cognitive measures and a functional measure, Ilise Lombardo, MD, Forum’s vice president of clinical research and medical affairs at Forum Pharmaceuticals, told Medscape Medical News. Lombardo said that two six-month, Phase III trials are underway for encenicline. Encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals), a novel α-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist, shows improvement of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia in a phase 2 randomized, controlled trial, potentially ushering in a long-anticipated treatment for an aspect of the disease not addressed by antipsychotics. With its unique mechanism seen as potentially helping to improve memory and cognitive function, encenicline is being studied as an adjunct to antipsychotics in treating cognitive impairment in schizophrenia as well as Alzheimer’s disease. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. This suppressive effect of pomaglumetad on stimulated EPSPs is reversed by the use of mGluR2/3 antagonists, such as LY341495. It increases the release of dopamine as well as its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in the prefrontal cortex in a manner similar to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine. Attempts by Eli Lilly and AstraZeneca to replicate findings showing potent partial agonist action of mGluR2/3 agonists at D2 receptors were unsuccessful. Novelty Based on the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia, glutamate receptor agonists have been suggested as an effective treatment for psychotic patients. Existing antipsychotic medications primarily treat schizophrenia by acting as antagonists at D2 receptors, while pomaglumetad has very low affinity for biogenic amine receptors. Pomaglumetad was the preferred drug candidate for further development due to its antipsychotic efficacy and lack of motor coordination effects at doses up to 30 mg/kg. It has shown high in vitro potency and efficacy as well as antipsychotic potential in animal studies. In both mice and rat studies, the drug demonstrates inhibition of induced hyperlocomotion and conditioned avoidance responding. Assays of locomotion and conditioned avoidance showed evidence of synergy between pomaglumetad and antipsychotic medication, as well as an absence of motor impairment typically observed with high doses of antipsychotic medications. The combination of pomaglumetad (5 and 20 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) achieved prefrontal cortical dopamine efflux significantly higher than that observed with treatment by either drug alone. Clinical use of pomaglumetad methionil Despite its apparent efficacy in animal models and in vitro, as well as its highly selective agonistic properties at mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptors, pomaglumetad displayed only 3% oral bioavailability in humans in a phase I clinical trial. The drug's poor uptake has been cited as, in part, due to its interaction with the peptide transporter PepT 1. This led to the synthesis and development of pomaglumetad methionil (LY-2140023), an oral methionine prodrug of pomaglumetad, in 2010 for oral treatment of schizophrenia by Eli Lilly. It has been proposed as useful treatment of both positive and negative symptoms by acting as a selective agonist at mGlu receptors and modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission. If treatment was well tolerated after a week at this target dose, the dose was increased to 40 mg BID. However, if the 20 mg dose was not well tolerated, the dose was decreased to 10 mg. Efficacy and clinical trials In 2007, a randomized phase II clinical trial showed that LY-2140023 taken twice daily for 4 weeks improved schizophrenia symptoms as measured with the PANSS and CGI-S when compared to placebo. However, post hoc analysis did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference in efficacy between LY-2140023 and olanzapine (positive control) groups. A second randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled clinical trial gave schizophrenia patients various doses (5, 20, 40, or 80 mg) of LY-2140023 monohydrate twice daily, yet none of the four doses were found\n\nEli Lilly has been forced to discontinue development of schizophrenia drug candidate, pomaglumetad methionil (mGlu2/3), after disappointing results in the second of two phase III clinical trials. The decision is a setback for Lilly, which had been hoping to position pomaglumetad methionil as a successor to its flagship schizophrenia drug Zyprexa (olanzapine), which is being hit hard by generic competition since losing patent protection last year. An analysis of the phase III HBBN study revealed that it was unlikely to meet its primary efficacy endpoint, while a phase II study called HBCO looking at pomaglumetad methionil in combination with other antipsychotics was similarly disappointing, said Lilly in a statement. Pomaglumetad methionil was different from existing antipsychotic drugs because it worked on glutamate rather than dopamine receptors, but worrying signs of a lack of efficacy had already been seen in phase II studies reported in 2009. The company pressed on because of a positive efficacy signal in a patient subgroup, but reported that its first phase III trial was negative last month, prompting analysts to scale back their expectations of approval and slash sales forecasts. President of Lilly Research Laboratories Jan Lundberg said: \"I'm disappointed in what these results mean for patients with schizophrenia who still are searching for options to treat this terrible illness\", whilst reaffirming the company's commitment to neuroscience research. The demise of pomaglumetad methionil comes in the wake of a string of negative trial results for Lilly, which badly needs new product launches as it is also facing patent expiries for blockbuster osteoporosis drug Evista (raloxifene). Alzheimer's drug candidate solanezumab missed its endpoint in to phase III trials earlier this month, although there were signs of some efficacy and it had been given little chance of success given the earlier failure of Pfizer' similar drug bapineuzumab. Meanwhile, a comparative study of the firm's osteoporosis drug Forteo (teriparatide) with rival drug risedronate on back pain was negative, and Daiichi Sankyo-partnered blood thinner Effient (prasugrel) failed to show superiority to clopidogrel in preventing heart attacks and strokes in cardiovascular patients. [Updated, 1:10 ET] Investors are going to have to wait awhile before they see Amicus Therapeutics submit its Fabry Disease drug to the FDA for approval. Instead, Amicus will complete that study, as well as another ongoing Phase 3 trial before filing a new drug application (NDA) with the FDA. While that doesn’t mean migalastat is done as a potential treatment for Fabry, it does mean the verdict won’t be known for some time. With the crucial data expected in the second half of 2014, Amicus could be looking at 2015 before having a chance to win FDA approval. Amicus’ drug for Gaucher Disease failed in clinical trials in 2009, and in December, Amicus said that the Fabry drug didn’t hit the main goal of its late-stage study after a six-month period. But Amicus believes that once all of its studies run their course—the Fabry study will conclude after two years of total data—the skeptics will be proven wrong. Fabry is currently treated with enzyme-replacement therapies, such as agalsidase (Fabrazyme), which are administered intravenously. Amicus’ drug is a pill. Agalsidase, sold by Sanofi/Genzyme, is the only drug approved to treat Fabry in the U.S.\nAmicus has two late-stage trials going. In the first trial, 60 patients were broken into two equal-sized groups and randomly given either migalastat or a placebo. The placebo group was then transitioned to migalastat after six months. At the end of the year, patients are given an option to continue therapy for an additional year (Crowley said 57 of those patients elected to do so). Amicus is collecting data from that study over 18 months, and hopes to show that migalistat isn’t inferior to enzyme-replacement therapy, Crowley said on the call. Amicus met with the FDA following the disappointing six-month results from its first study, which showed that 41 percent of the patients taking its drug met the study’s goal—to reduce GL-3 levels by 50 percent—while 28 percent of the placebo group did. [Updated with CEO comments] Crowley also points out that Amicus has shown in mid-stage trials both in Fabry and Pompe that its drugs can improve the effectiveness of enzyme-replacement therapies when used in concert with them, and that it has a “next generation” enzyme-replacement therapy for Fabry in preclinical development that is already partnered with GlaxoSmithKline that will begin clinical trials in early 2014. Amicus has a drug for Pompe disease, an enzyme-related muscle disorder, in mid-stage clinical trials, and a pre-clinical drug for Parkinson’s disease, both of which it owns all the rights to. Crowley says Amicus has already had discussions about partnerships for both, and could attempt to structure deals for those individually, or for its platform for creating next-generation enzyme-replacement therapies as a whole. For the Parkinson’s drug, Amicus would be “less insistent” on keeping marketing rights, and would be more apt to trade potential royalties and milestone payments for a share in the development expenses, according to Crowley. However, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly terminated further development of the compound in 2012 after it failed in phase III clinical trials. In September 2013, the results of a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial investigating the impact of adjunctive LY-2140023 on prominent negative symptoms in schizophrenia was published and failed to demonstrate any benefit. Pharmacology Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamics Clinical development of pomaglumetad resulted from efforts to discover potent and selective mGluR agonists for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. These receptors reduce the activity of postsynaptic potentials in the cortex and act by inhibiting the release of glutamate and GABA. This suppressive effect of pomaglumetad on stimulated EPSPs is reversed by the use of mGluR2/3 antagonists, such as LY341495.

CDC also has deployed staff, both domestically and globally, to assist in epidemiologic investigation of the virus and support state, local and territorial health departments with the H1N1 mass vaccination campaign. pandemic has presented considerable challenges—in particular the delay in production and delivery of a vaccine, in part because of the slow growth of the virus during the manufacturing process. Today I will update you on the overall situation, provide an update on vaccination status, and discuss other steps we are taking to address these challenges. H1N1 was the dominant strain of influenza in the southern hemisphere during its winter flu season. Visits to doctors for influenza-like illness as well as flu-related hospitalizations and deaths among children and young adults also are higher than expected for this time of year, and higher than have been observed at any time in many recent flu seasons. Enhancing Hospitalization Surveillance: CDC has greatly increased the capacity to collect detailed information on patients hospitalized with influenza. Using the 198 hospitals in the Emerging Infections Program (EIP) network and 6 additional sites with 76 hospitals, CDC monitors a population of 25.6 million to estimate hospitalization rates by age group and monitor the clinical course among persons with severe disease requiring hospitalization. Expanding Testing Capability: Within 2.5 weeks of first detecting the 2009 H1N1 virus, CDC had fully characterized the new virus, disseminated information to researchers and public health officials, and developed and begun shipping to states a new test to detect cases of 2009 H1N1 infection. It is vital that accurate testing continue in the United States and abroad to monitor any mutations in the virus that may indicate increases in infection severity, resistance to antiviral drugs, or a decrease in the match between the vaccine strain and the circulating strain. Health Care System Readiness: HHS is also using multiple systems to track the impact the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak has on our health care system. To date, state and local officials and health care facilities have been able to accommodate the increased patient loads due to 2009 H1N1, but HHS is monitoring this closely and is prepared to respond quickly if the situation warrants. Implementing a Flu-related School Dismissal Monitoring System: CDC and the U.S. Department of Education (ED), in collaboration with state and local health and education agencies and national non-governmental organizations, have implemented a flu-related school dismissal monitoring system for the 2009-2010 school year. Slowing the spread and reducing the impact of 2009 H1N1 and seasonal flu is a shared responsibility. There are many ways to prevent respiratory infections and CDC provides specific recommendations targeted to a wide variety of groups, including the general public, people with certain underlying health conditions, infants, children, parents, pregnant women, and seniors. CDC quarantine station staff respond to reports of illness, including influenza-like illness when reported, in international travelers arriving at U.S. ports of entry. Some ways to combat the spread of respiratory infections include staying home when you are sick and keeping sick children at home. Taking personal responsibility for one’s health will help reduce the spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza and other respiratory illnesses. Through the CDC INFO Line, we serve the public, clinicians, state and local health departments and other federal partners 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, in English and Spanish both for phone and email inquiries.

Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it.

Bulgaria's health minister, Stoycho Katsarov, defended the measures, stating that no additional lockdown measures had been introduced for those not vaccinated, merely relaxed for those that were. ITN also opposed an order by the health minister, which allowed local health authorities to impose additional lockdown measures and potentially require some schoolchildren to wear protective facemasks in in-person lessons during pandemic peaks. The party defined as \"tyranny\" an order by Sofia's Medical University that required students attending in-person lectures to either present vaccination certificates or recently conducted COVID-19 tests.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available. Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development. Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells. Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development. Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years. More recently gene therapy has been attempted as an alternative to the bone marrow transplant. In 1990, four-year-old Ashanthi DeSilva became the first patient to undergo successful gene therapy. Researchers collected samples of DeSilva's blood, isolated some of her white blood cells, and used a retrovirus to insert a healthy adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene into them. This, augmented by weekly injections of ADA, corrected her deficiency. In 2000, a gene therapy \"success\" resulted in SCID patients with a functional immune system. ; Inclusion criteria are pre-symptomatic late infantiles and both pre- and early-symptomatic juveniles. ; The trial was at a single center at the San Raffaele Institute in Milan, Italy. The trial had several compassionate access patients and ultimately was expanded to 20 patients'' ; In late 2013 GSK exercised its option for the San Rafaelle gene therapy technology and is working with the Milan Investigators to prepare\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Researchers at UT Southwestern and other institutions may have found a way to reverse the damage that patients sustain from heart attacks, traumatic brain injuries and other conditions. They accomplish this by converting a less desirable type of cell, such as a scar-forming cell, into a highly desirable one, such as a nerve cell, using a process known as direct reprogramming. Most recent efforts to convert one cell type into another have relied on stem cells — immature versions of adult cells. But stem cells can be difficult to manipulate and have caused controversy because they are sometimes derived from embryos donated by fertility clinics. Many scientists say direct reprogramming is a promising new approach to regenerative medicine — a field dedicated to curing disease by helping the body repair and regrow its own tissues. In recent years, scientists have used the method to grow new brain cells, liver cells, pancreatic tissue and parts of the inner ear responsible for hearing loss. Researchers hope to one day develop drugs that will enable patients’ bodies to repair their own damaged organs, much the way a salamander can regrow its own heart and a python can double the size of its liver. At UT Southwestern’s new Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine, researchers are focused on cultivating heart and nerve cells. “I wanted to understand how specialized cells were formed and how large sets of genes turned on and off during development,” he said. It could also help scientists gain insight into how diseases develop when errors creep into the process. “I was trained as a pediatric cardiologist and was interested in how the heart forms in the embryo and how that goes awry in human disease,” says Srivastava, who now directs cardiac and stem cell research at the Gladstone Institutes and is a professor at the University of California San Francisco. The two went on to discover many of the genes that control heart development. In a 2010 paper in the journal Cell, Srivastava showed that scar-forming cells known as fibroblasts could be converted into beating heart cells by adding just three ingredients. Those ingredients, proteins known as transcription factors, are master regulators that flip genes on and off. The genes involved are the same ones that direct heart formation in the womb. Each group used a different combination of transcription factors to reprogram the cells, but both found that the technique improved heart function in the animals following a heart attack. Scientists use them in many different ways. In one approach, researchers take a sample of skin, fat or bone marrow from a patient, convert the mature cells into their previous immature states, then reprogram them to form a new type of tissue. In a second approach, scientists can extract stem cells from embryos and then convert them. In clinical trials, researchers have also used a third approach: They have taken so-called adult stem cells from bone marrow and injected them into the heart, hoping the stem cells take on the properties of muscle cells. Adult stem cells have had mixed results. So far, researchers have tried direct reprogramming in mice and in human cells in a lab dish. He starts with glial cells, which reproduce in the brain and spinal cord following an injury and can form scars. Most scientists who work on direct reprogramming are continuing their research on stem cells in parallel. Another advantage of using stem cells is that the process creates a lot more cells to work with than direct reprogramming. “Right now, if you take a dish of fibroblasts in a lab and reprogram that dish, you can get maybe 10 percent of those cells to turn into heart muscle cells, and we’d like to improve that efficiency,” says Olson. Yet direct reprogramming, says Zhang, is more akin to true regeneration. “We design a way to help the tissue repair or regenerate itself,” he says. Stem cells, by contrast, involve growing cells in a dish and then injecting them into patients. The ultimate hope with direct reprogramming is that it will lead to a drug that will stimulate patients’ bodies to heal themselves. Srivastava is testing his direct reprogramming technique in pigs, whose hearts are closer in size to those of humans. The goal is to see if he can generate enough muscle to dramatically improve the heart’s pumping ability. the validity of this research, including the appropriateness of the samples as representative of normally aging hearts.

Because the cells of the heart do not replace themselves naturally, those who have suffered from heart disease may have few treatment options available. Stem cells offer hope in the fight against heart disease. Stem cells could also be used to build new heart tissue, even whole new hearts. The American Heart Association (AHA) estimates that 84 million people who currently suffer from cardiovascular disease might one day be cured or treated through stem cell breakthroughs. About a decade and a half ago, scientists began testing the effectiveness of stem cells in regenerating heart tissue by simulating heart attacks in mice and rats and then repairing the damage with heart cells grown from stem cells. In 2001, scientists reported that after they injected stem cells into the damaged wall of the ventricle, these cells led to the formation of new cells, which in turn developed into coronary arteries, arterioles and capillaries. In 2003, sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville became the first human to receive experimental stem cell therapy to revive his damaged heart tissue. In lieu of heart transplant surgery, Bonnville’s parents opted for a stem cell therapy to repair his damaged heart. A study looking at safety and feasibility of infusing cord blood stem cells into the hearts of babies born with a defect known as hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is nearing completion, and we have already heard of one family who is sleeping better knowing their little boy is on the road to recovery. “And if we make it strong enough, we believe that that has a shot at delaying and preventing transplant for a significant number of these children.\" After collecting the cord blood at the time of birth, processing it in Minnesota and cryo-preserving it for three months, the cord blood stem cells were thawed and infused directly into Ryals’s heart near the end of his second operation. In 2007, Sir Magdi Yacoub, a world-famous heart surgeon based at Imperial College London, and a team of researchers developed heart valve cells with stem cells. Presenting at the American Heart Association's annual scientific sessions in New Orleans during November 2008, cardiac surgeon Dr. Ralf Sodian reported that his team had used stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood to create tissue-engineered heart valves. Stem cells collected at birth from the umbilical cord may help doctors fashion new heart valves for children born with heart valve defects. \"If we replace a valve in a child, they will need surgery several times in their lifetime because they will grow out of the devices, so the ultimate goal is to have a construct\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These include intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), LDL and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Nearly one in four people found to have LDL cholesterol in the “desirable” level through the traditional calculation method actually may have needed more aggressive treatment, according to a study at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine published in 2013 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. Also included is LDL cholesterol, which is normally estimated rather than directly measured. To calculate LDL, labs use a formula known as the Friedewald equation, a more expedient way to assess LDL compared with actually measuring it, (which involves a cumbersome and expensive process called ultracentrifugation). But Johns Hopkins researchers found that this often makes LDL cholesterol appear lower than it really is for some high-risk patients. Because it’s individualized and looks at all non-HDL cholesterol—not just LDL—it can be used to make more precise decisions about treatment to prevent heart attack and stroke. “LDL cholesterol alone is a relatively poor predictor of your risk,” Jones says. This newer LDL cholesterol formula is being adopted by U.S. laboratories as well as others around the world. Lack of evidence for such a recommendation is discussed in an article in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It has been estimated from the results of multiple human pharmacologic LDL lowering trials that LDL should be lowered to below 30 to reduce cardiovascular event rates to near zero. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of \n\n lesser extent their size, has a stronger and consistent correlation with individual clinical outcome than the amount of cholesterol within LDL particles, even if the LDL-C estimation is approximately correct. There is increasing evidence and recognition of the value of more targeted and accurate measurements of LDL particles. Specifically, LDL particle number (concentration), and to a lesser extent size, have shown slightly stronger correlations with atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular events than obtained using chemical measures of the amount of cholesterol carried by the LDL particles. It is possible that the LDL cholesterol concentration can be low, yet LDL particle number high and cardiovascular events rates are high. Correspondingly, it is possible that LDL cholesterol concentration can be relatively high, yet LDL particle number low and cardiovascular events are also low. followed 7,983 patients >55 years of age for a mean period of 4.6 years, \n\nAccurately calculating the level of LDL cholesterol in patients is important because it helps assess their risk of heart disease. LDL cholesterol, also known as \"bad\" cholesterol, builds up in artery walls and contributes to the formation of plaque, which can harden and narrow the arteries. However, researchers at Johns Hopkins have developed a more precise calculation method that provides a more individualized and accurate assessment of risks associated with LDL cholesterol. Regular screening and monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels can help guide treatment decisions and interventions, such as lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Regular monitoring and management of LDL cholesterol levels are essential for maintaining heart health.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This could allow doctors to quickly distinguish between a viral or bacterial illness, and identify early cases of potentially deadly infections. This would enable conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia or pneumonia - which are caused by bacterial infections - to be caught more rapidly. This would help combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. At the moment, when a child arrives at a surgery or hospital with fever, doctors have no quick method of distinguishing whether the child is suffering from bacterial or viral illness. Differentiating between viruses and bacteria is crucially important. Although viral infections are much more common than bacterial infections, the latter are far more dangerous, and lead to a deadly conditions such as meningitis, septicaemia and pneumonia. Professor Michael Levin, from Department of Medicine at Imperial College London, who led the study explained: \"Fever is one of the most common reasons children are brought to medical care. However every year many children are sent away from emergency departments or doctors' surgeries because the medical team thinks they have a viral infection, when in fact they are suffering from life-threatening bacterial infections - which are often only diagnosed too late. Conversely, many other children are admitted to hospital and receive antibiotics because the medical team are unable to immediately exclude the possibility of a bacterial infection - but in fact they are suffering from a virus.\" Once the children were diagnosed with a viral or bacterial infection using traditional methods, the team studied the genes that had been switched on in the children's white blood cells. Using a method known as RNA micro arrays, which measure changes in 48,000 genes simultaneously using only a small drop of each child's blood, the team found two genes are switched on in bacterial infections. Dr Jethro Herberg, senior lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases at Imperial, and co-author of the research added: \"We are facing a growing threat from antibiotic resistant bacteria. The Natural Resources Defense Council an environmental advocacy group believes that oil and gas exploration is leading to overwhelming whale deaths in the Gulf of Guinea. Similar cases have happened in the Canary Islands and Hawaii. There is a belief that ocean noise presents a significant threat to marine mammals and other marine species. The head of the International Fund for Animal Welfare's whale programme, Patrick Ramage said collisions with ships, water pollution and seismic activity from oil drilling can kill or disorient whales. it switched to using echolocation to ascertain the behavior being modeled. In a 2018 publication \"Bottlenose dolphins can understand their partner's role in a cooperative task\" DRC staff tested the ability of bottlenose dolphins to coordinate their behavior to receive a reward. In a trial, pairs of dolphins were instructed to swim across their lagoons and press an underwater button, with each dolphin assigned a button. In some trials, both dolphins were given the command at the same time; in other trials, one dolphin would receive the command up to 20 seconds before the other. Trials were considered successful if the dolphins pressed the buttons at the same \n\n (within one second). The dolphins learned to coordinate their actions, with the first dolphin to receive the command eventually waiting for the second dolphin to receive its command before acting. This demonstrated that dolphins are capable of coordinated action in pursuit of a common goal. Studies have also been published that demonstrates that dolphins understand some numbers concepts and other research that explores maternal use of signature whistles. The center has also published a study that shows that dolphins in human care in the U.S. live as long or longer than dolphins in the wild. The center has also collaborated with Duke University researchers on dolphins' energy expenditures. Viral vs. Bacterial Pneumonia: What's Really the Difference? See what else is different between viral and bacterial pneumonia, along with the best ways to ward them off. Why do people get pneumonia? All sorts of viruses—from the common cold to influenza—can lead to viral pneumonia, which is fairly contagious, Roger Lovell, MD, infectious disease specialist at Piedmont Athens Regional Medical Center, tells Health. Other types of pneumonia to note: necrotizing pneumonia (a rare but quite serious type of bacterial pneumonia) and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (another rare disease, with unknown causes, that’s typically treated with steroids). Vaccines are also a powerful preventive measure. First, antibiotics simply don’t work to treat viruses.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only\n\nMany patients come to Iran from different parts of the world to seek orthopedics care and surgeries. Patients with joint diseases, knee arthritis, and weight gain related joint problems can take advantage of high quality Orthopedic care services such as knee surgeries and treatment of bone fractures. Orthopedic surgeons treat a wide variety of diseases and conditions, including: fractures and dislocations, torn ligaments, sprains, and strains, tendon injuries, pulled muscles, and bursitis, ruptured disks, sciatica, low back pain, and scoliosis, knock knees, bow legs, bunions, and hammer toes, arthritis and osteoporosis, one tumors, muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, club foot and unequal leg length, abnormalities of the fingers and toes and growth abnormalities. The torn meniscus is repaired by a variety of minimally invasive techniques and requires postoperative protection to allow healing. This technique lets surgeon to see the knee joint without making a large incision through the skin and other soft tissues. A small incision is made at the knee joint so the surgeon may insert the arthroscope, a long, narrow tube-like instrument with a viewing eyepiece on one end, into the joint. If considerable damage is available within all three joint sections, a total knee replacement most likely will be recommended; however, if only one requires intervention, a partial knee replacement may be considered. During surgery, an orthopedic surgeon carves away the damaged part of the knee and replaces it with an artificial joint made of metal or plastic. A meniscus tear is a most usual knee cartilage damage. The MCL faces inward toward the opposite knee. For often people occur one episode of dislocation of the patella with no further recurrence. Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is a surgical method showed in patients with more severe patellar instability. Hip arthroscopy (hip scope) is a surgical procedure to the viewing of the interior of the hip joint through an arthroscope (which inserted into the body through a small incision) and diagnose of hip pathology through a minimally invasive approach. Since 1990s, the advances in arthroscopic surgical equipment has allowed surgeons to treat problems that were untreatable or which required more open procedures. After surgery physical therapy begins as soon as the patient feels comfortable to restore function and movement to the joint. In children surgery suggested when it is the only treatment to the joint. Especially older athletes who have been highly active in their 20’s and 30’s athletes can experience hip pain, as a result of many circumstances: Hip pointer, Bone fractures, Muscle strains and tendinitis, Stress fractures, Muscle tendon bursitis, Contusion (bruise, commonly called a hip “pointer”), Hip labral tears, Osteoarthritis Sport hip injuries are usually identified via a detailed examination by a qualified sports-medicine physician. After an injury retrieval Achilles tendon function is critical. The goal to re-join the calf muscles with the heel bone to restore normal muscles activities. It’s also known as ankle arthrodesis is usually done to treat arthritis in the ankle. If patients have severe ankle arthritis and more conventional methods have failed they can be candidates for an ankle arthrodesis. A fusion is a very good operation for\n\n Those who have had this procedure done are expected to have a stronger ankle, meaning their ankle will no longer give out on them. It is estimated that most patients who have this procedure experience restored stability. Their ankles felt stable, and after they completely recovered, they noticed improved stability and significant restoration of function. In which case, doctors recommend continually icing even after full recovery from the procedure. Any pre-existing arthritis stage in upper or lower ankle joints will not be changed through this procedure and may act as a factor in decision making of pros and cons. Eccentric training creates greater force owing to the \"decreased rate of cross-bridge muscle detachments.\" Patients and athletes will have more muscle force for bigger weights when eccentric training. ; Increased DOMS leads to more tenderness in eccentric, rather than pure pain or tendon swelling amongst patients. ; Older individuals are less vulnerable to injury from eccentric exercise, primarily because of the \n\nAdolescent patients with first-time acute patellar dislocations treated surgically have a lower risk for recurrent dislocation and higher knee-related quality of life and sports-related outcomes compared with those managed conservatively, according to a recent review and meta-analysis from the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) in New York City. Nwachukwu and colleagues included 11 studies that provided data on 627 injured knees: 470 were managed conservatively (mean age of patients, 17 years) and 157 were treated surgically (mean age, 16.1 years). Both conservative and surgical treatments were associated with good functional outcomes. The most commonly used surgical procedure is medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy published the findings in March 2016. The standard of care for patellar dislocation is conservative management, based on historical studies, such as Cash and Hughston in 1988 in the American Journal of Sports Medicine, that have found good, if not excellent, results with nonoperative care, said Nwachukwu. This care consists almost exclusively of physical therapy to improve proprioception and strengthen the quadriceps and surrounding knee musculature. Trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity were risk factors for repeat dislocation in both groups. In addition to the primary outcomes, the current study also identified trochlear dysplasia and skeletal immaturity as predictive risk factors for repeat dislocation in both conservatively and surgically treated patients. Because patients who underwent surgery also demonstrated higher functional outcome scores on the KOOS sports-related outcomes subscale, an additional consideration for undergoing early surgery might include an elite level of athletic participation, he said. These findings therefore suggest that, in highly active pediatric patients with pathoanatomy that predisposes them to recurrent dislocation, surgery as a first-line treatment might reduce recurrence risk and maximize functional outcome. Nwachukwu acknowledged this, as well: “Based on the limitations of the data, our study is one data point that should be considered with prior studies and future studies when making a clinical decision on pediatric patients with this injury,” he said. Finally, Blakemore pointed out why it’s important to make a distinction based on patients’ activity level: “For less active individuals, the benefits of early surgery may not be as clear, and in those patients in particular, I believe a trial of conservative treatment is still appropriate,” she said. Nwachukwu and his coauthors intend to continue exploring this topic by further analyzing whether highly functioning athletes benefit more in terms of quality of life and other areas from surgery than conservative care. They also plan to establish a prospective registry for patellar dislocation in which they can follow patients regardless of their treatment and track their outcomes in a longitudinal fashion.

But there is still discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS. We've come a long way in our understanding of HIV and AIDS, but discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is still rampant. Advances in research have made it possible to live with the disease, as people do with other chronic illnesses. But the greatest challenge for many people is still the stigma that accompanies the illness. The burden of AIDS is much higher among African-Americans. These fears mean that many people are afraid to acknowledge their sexual orientation or HIV-positive status. For these reasons, many prefer to risk infection rather than face the stigma of HIV/AIDS. Experts warn that \"addictphobia\" has contributed to discrimination against those who were infected with HIV through IV drug use. Among these false notions are the ideas that addiction is a moral failing and that addicts are unable or unwilling to change. As a result, people who are HIV-positive, African-American, and use IV drugs often face three stigmas. This heavy burden can increase isolation, anxiety, distress, and depression among those who are HIV-positive. Discrimination against people with HIV is often rooted in a lack of understanding about the virus and how it spreads. Contact your local public health department to find community-based organizations that provide HIV/AIDS information, counseling, and testing. One of the best ways to counter discrimination is to advocate for change in policies that prevent people with HIV from getting the care, housing, and respect they need. Consider being open with those you can trust. You can choose whom to tell about your HIV status. You need to think about who can give you the support and comfort you deserve. If you already have a close network, consider volunteering to give support to others with HIV. The theme \"Know Your Status\" for the 2018 World AIDS Day commemoration is of great significance. It emphasizes the importance of urging people to know their HIV infection status by getting tested. The theme was chosen to shed light on the fact that a significant number of individuals worldwide are living with HIV without even being aware of it. According to the UNAIDS data from 2017, about 9.4 million people were living with HIV but did not know their status. By promoting \"Know Your Status,\" the campaign aims to encourage people to get tested for HIV. Additionally, when people know their status, they can take steps to protect their own health and prevent the transmission of the virus to others. The significance of this theme is further highlighted by the fact that approximately 1.8 million people became newly infected with HIV in 2017, and sadly, 940,000 people died from AIDS-related illnesses in the same year. The theme serves to remind individuals about the risks associated with unprotected sexual relations, unsafe blood transfusions, and exposure to contaminated injecting equipment. It also highlights the possibility of mother-to-child transmission. By encouraging people to get tested, the campaign aims to facilitate early diagnosis, timely treatment, and prevention of further transmission, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and reduced HIV incidence. John has said that he took risks with unprotected sex during the 1980s and considers himself lucky to have avoided contracting HIV. In 1986, he joined with Dionne Warwick, Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder to record the single \"That's What Friends Are For\", with profits donated to the American Foundation for AIDS Research. In April 1990, John performed his 1968 ballad \"Skyline Pigeon\" at the funeral of Ryan White, a teenage haemophiliac he had befriended. John became more closely associated with AIDS charities following the deaths of his friends Ryan White in 1990 and Freddie Mercury in 1991, raising large amounts of money and \n\n an annual pro-am event to benefit AIDS charities, most notably the Elton John AIDS Foundation, of which King is a chairperson. John has appeared in commercials for Diet Coke, the Royal Mail, Snickers, John Lewis & Partners department store among others.

High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. One of the greatest concerns with heart disease, especially CAD, is having a heart attack. Making healthy lifestyle choices after a heart attack can reduce the risk of future heart attacks. Screening can identify changes in the cells of the cervix that could lead to cancer. Screening might include a Pap test and, for some women, testing for human papillomavirus (HPV). About one in four Americans are currently infected with HPV virus. The HPV vaccine is given in a series of two shots. Women aged 30-65 year should have a Pap test and an HPV test (known as “co-testing”) every 5 years (preferred). Although preferred, it is acceptable to have a Pap test every 3 years alone.

Individuals at moderate- to high-risk received assessment, safety planning interventions, and structured phone follow-up. New York State received one of three Applied Research toward Zero Suicide Healthcare Systems grants from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to implement Zero Suicide in over 165 outpatient clinics serving more than 90,000 behavioral health patients. Since the inception of the project, more than 4,000 clinicians were trained in the Assess, Intervene, and Monitor for Suicide Prevention (AIM-SP) model of suicide safer care, more than 30,000 patients were screened, and more than 2,700 at-risk patients received a package of intensive, enhanced suicide-specific interventions. These trainings include evidenced-based suicide risk screening, assessment, intervention, and monitoring. The two agencies held the first ever Zero Suicide learning collaborative with outpatient substance use disorder treatment providers, informing the development of suicide safer care protocols being piloted in inpatient and outpatient treatment settings. From this workgroup, multiple joint initiatives have formed including discussions of regulation revisions, cross consultation, promoting collaboration between suicide and substance use prevention coalitions, prevention on college and university campuses, training OASAS resource providers, and gambling and suicide risk. More information about and access to these resources are available on the Suicide Loss of a Patient or Client page of the website. The current system for suicide death reporting is plagued by significant problems including misclassification, underreporting, a two-year reporting lag, and incomplete information on circumstances and upstream risk factors surrounding the death. Four workgroups have formed out of the Council including Zero Suicide in health and behavioral health care, communities and coalitions, school and youth initiatives, and data and surveillance. A marketing toolkit is available to promote Crisis Text and Got5. Click here to learn more about the Crisis Text partnership from the Commissioner of the New York State Office of Mental Health. Effective strategies and interventions for preventing adolescent suicide include:\n\n1. School-based interventions: Developing comprehensive suicide prevention programs within schools that include educational components, training for staff, and providing access to mental health services for students in need. Postvention strategies: Establishing postvention protocols to provide support and assistance to individuals affected by suicide, including friends, family, and the broader community. usually considered suicide. The predominant view of modern medicine is that suicide is a mental health concern, associated with psychological factors such as the difficulty of coping with depression, inescapable pain or fear, or other mental disorders and pressures. Most suicides (for various reasons) do not succeed on a first attempt; those who later gain a history of repetitions are significantly more at risk of eventual completion. Nearly a million people worldwide die by suicide annually. While completed suicides are higher in men, women have higher rates for suicide attempts. Elderly males have the highest suicide rate, although rates for young adults have been increasing in recent years. “Thoughts of suicide and suicide attempts are more common among children who experience mental health issues like anxiety and depression. However, mental health is only one of a variety of factors that impact youth suicide,” the report reads. The report points to things such as impulse control, and access to means of self-harm such as firearms and prescription drugs. Risk factors mentioned in the report include stress, rejection, bullying, childhood abuse, trauma, social isolation and family violence or disruption. According to the report, 16 percent of North Carolina high school students reported considering suicide in 2017. “The influence of caring and well-trained adults, combined with evidence-based solutions that reduce family and community stressors, can prevent dangerous feelings of hopelessness in children and adolescents. Effective strategies include strengthening our crisis response system, increased investment in behavioral health systems, more partnerships between schools and behavioral health providers and screening more children and youth for mental health needs,” the report reads. Every 40 seconds someone in the world dies by suicide. Suicide remains a leading cause of mortality worldwide accounting for over 800,000 deaths each year. While females are 1.4 times more likely to attempt suicide, males are 3.5 times more likely to die by suicide than females. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Institute of Medicine have declared that suicide prevention be a global and national imperative. The most common means used in US suicides are firearms (51%), suffocation, poison/overdose (15%), jump/fall (3%),and cutting (2%). Anti-anxiety agents, sedatives, hypnotics, pain relievers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are the most frequent medications associated with suicide. One in five suicide attempts also involve the use of antidepressant medications. Taken in total, multiple medications are often present in attempted suicide and mortality. Those with PTSD have higher rates of opioid use disorder (OUD). The suicide rates for PTSD and OUD are 58 and 140 per 100,000, respectively. Several studies have discovered that suicidal individuals may not always be aware that their symptoms may be helped by psychological interventions. A survey of 165 college students with increased risk of suicide who had not sought professional treatment found that 66% of them believed that they did not require treatment. Another college student study in those with suicidal ideation over the past 12 months reported that the students who did not seek medical assistance often felt that their problems were not serious enough to warrant psychological treatment and would improve on their own. These students also believed that stress, a potential severe manifestation of suicidal ideation, was part of a normal college environment and not something to raise concern. The WHO's global survey found that 58% of adults also had a low perceived need to seek treatment. Additionally, suicidal individuals may not report needing care because they have a stigma associated with their symptoms. Research has shown that positive attitudes towards care, mental health literacy, peer training, family and friend support, prior service utilization, gatekeeper training, and screening for suicidal thoughts and behaviors are helpful to improve recognition of at-risk individuals and referrals to appropriate treatment. Given the large number of attempted suicides, the chances that you will encounter someone planning to take their ownlife is highly probable. Suicide awareness and prevention training can provide key insight, help those at risk, and potentially save lives.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Autism is frequently associated with fragile X syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, and may be caused by lead poisoning and metabolic disorders. Brain inflammation, triggered by an overactive immune system, is common among people with autism. Research indicates that a gluten and casein-free diet may be helpful in some children with autism. Since fish oils have benefited some autistic children, it may be a good idea to include more cold water fish in the diet. It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of persons with autism. If this is the case, diets free of gluten and /or casein should reduce the symptoms associated with autism. However, the fourth outcome, reduction in autism traits, reported a significant beneficial treatment effect for the combined gluten- and casein- free diet. There is a scattering of research that indicates nutrients may be of some benefit in treating autism, but many more clinical trials are needed before we have a better understanding the role nutritional supplements in the treatment of autism. Discuss with your child's doctor to see if they are appropriate for your child. Serotonergic disturbances in autistic disorder: L-5-hydroxytryptophan administration to autistic youngsters increases the blood concentrations of serotonin in patients but not in controls. Some studies have suggested that disorders in the peripheral and central metabolism of serotonin (5-HT) may play a role in the pathophysiology of autistic disorder. Children with autism given carnosine showed statistically significant improvements on several tests including an improvement in vocabulary and recognizing a picture. The carnosine dose should be probably be low for kids, much less than the 500 mg adult dose. Researchers at the Autism and Epilepsy Specialty Services in Lake Bluff, Illinois, investigated 31 children with autism in an 8-week, double-blinded study to determine if carnosine would result in changes. The children received 800 mg of carnosine a day and were compared with a group of children on placebo. He also developed type 1 diabetes as an adult. You mentioned a nutrient, L-Carnosine to help type 1 diabetics and said it also helped brain function in autistics. And to prove it wasn't all in our heads, his endocrinologist has lowered his insulin twice since he began taking the L-Carnosine. What would be the appropriate dosage for the various supplements that are suggested for autism? Research in the area of supplement use for children at various ages with autism is quite recent and little is known about the benefits, risks, or effectiveness of these natural supplements. Please consult with your pediatrician. I have an adult son who has autism, we started giving him carnosine a couple of years ago and noticed an improvement in his social skills within a month. Children with autism may be deficient in the fatty acids EPA and / or DHA found in fish oils, hence a role for diet. A pilot study at the University of Stirling found that children with autism had cells that broke down fatty acids more rapidly than normal cells. Brain cell membranes are composed primarily of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, substances found in oily fish such as mackerel and salmon. A study of about 20 autistic children last year revealed that cell membranes in their blood metabolized, or processed, fatty acids at a faster rate than other children. The discovery led to speculation that a fatty acid deficiency may be partially responsible for the onset of autism. \"We have already seen a connection between omega levels and schizophrenia and dyslexia,\" said Dr Gordon Bell of the university. If cell function in the brain is changed, the behavior of the brain will change as well. If the scientists confirm this is what causes autism, they may conclude that the answer is to replenish \"bricks\" of fatty acids at a greater rate; in short, eat more fish. Behavioral effects of omega-3 Fatty Acid supplementation in young adults with severe autism: an open label study. Nineteen young adults with severe autism, aged 18-40 years, received two fish oil capsules per day [0.93g of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) plus 5mg of vitamin E to avoid lipid peroxidation] for 6 weeks. Subjects were assessed with an ad hoc caregiver questionnaire, the Rossago Behavioral Checklist, for the assessment of behavioral anomalies. No significant improvements were observed with regard to the severity and frequency of problematic behaviors either during the active treatment period or during the post-treatment 6-week observation period. Our negative findings do not point toward a major effect of omega-3 FA supplementation on behavioral abnormalities in adults with severe autism. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-week pilot trial investigating the effects of 1.5 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids (.84 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid, .7 g/d docosahexaenoic acid) supplementation in 13 children (aged 5 to 17 years) with autism disorders accompanied by severe tantrums, aggression, or self-injurious behavior. Plasma fatty acid levels in children with autism. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, which results in hippocampal neurogenesis reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out the negative effects of social isolation on AHN. compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia. Neural injections of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) were applied to males of both groups to test for neurogenesis. Adult hippocampal neurogenesis was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, but not in the TMF male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells. Luteinizing hormone signals specialized cells in the testicles (Leydig cells) to secrete testosterone into the bloodstream; follicle-stimulating hormone stimulates sperm production. The drugs used for medical castration inhibit this sequence of events at various stages. A synthetic form of the female hormone estrogen can lower testosterone levels to the castrate range by blocking the release of luteinizing hormone from the pituitary gland. Daily doses of synthetic estrogen (Premarin) are as effective as surgical castration, although the hormone takes longer to work, with testosterone levels falling over a two-week period. However, there is renewed interest in diethylstilbestrol (DES), a form of estrogen used in the 1960s for advanced prostate cancer. But after a short period, they block the release of luteinizing hormone and reduce testosterone secretion from the testicles. The result is testosterone levels similar to those that occur after surgical castration or with estrogen. The bisphosphonates pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa) have been shown to prevent bone loss associated with LHRH agonists, and zoledronic acid may actually boost bone density. LHRH antagonists. These abnormalities generally improve when the medication is stopped. Because anti-androgens do not block testosterone productiona characteristic that sets them apart from the other types of hormone therapyerectile function may be preserved in some patients. When used alone, anti-androgens may not be as effective as medical or surgical castration. The combination of an anti-androgen (to block the effect of adrenal androgens) and castration (which halts testosterone production in the testicles) is referred to as total androgen blockade or total androgen suppression. For example, a recent analysis of numerous studies found no difference in survival between men treated with total androgen blockade and those who underwent surgical castration or took LHRH agonists alone. Treatment is then discontinued until PSA levels begin to climb again. Some doctors believe that cycling therapy on and off may delay the emergence of these deadly cells. This practice, known as intermittent androgen suppression, is associated with fewer side effects because the therapy is discontinued for periods of time. More studies are needed to determine whether intermittent androgen suppression is as effective at slowing disease progression as continuous androgen suppression. The drug is approved by the FDA to treat fungal infections, but it also inhibits the production of adrenal and testicular androgens. Nizoral is used only when lowering androgens rapidly might be beneficial (to alleviate pain, for example). In addition, it is used only in the short term, because it raises luteinizing hormone levels, which can cause rising testosterone levels and lead to disease progression.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Somers later became the author of a series of self-help books, including Ageless: The Naked Truth About Bioidentical Hormones (2006), about bioidentical hormone replacement therapy. She has released two autobiographies, four diet books, and a book of poetry. Somers has been criticized for her views on some medical subjects and her advocacy of the Wiley Protocol, which has been labelled as \"scientifically unproven and dangerous\". Her promotion of alternative cancer treatments has received criticism from the American Cancer Society. Personal life Born Suzanne Marie Mahoney in the San Francisco suburb of San Bruno, California, Somers is the third of four children in an Irish-American Catholic family. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. Somers has three granddaughters, Camelia, Violet and Daisy Hamel-Buffa. Somers was diagnosed with stage II breast cancer in April 2000, and had a lumpectomy to remove the cancer followed by radiation therapy, but decided to forgo chemotherapy in favor of a fermented mistletoe extract called Iscador. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. Those close to the situation suggested that Somers' rebellion was largely due to husband Hamel's influences. Infomercials Calling her a legend in the industry, on May 2, 2014, Direct Marketing Response inducted Somers into the infomercial Hall of Fame. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. Somers sued Playboy and settled for $50,000—which was donated to charity, at least $10,000 of it going to the Easter Seals. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981. Initially she was angered again, but eventually agreed after discussing it with her family. She felt she would have a better chance to control the quality of the photos the second time, and having such control was an important condition that Somers attached to posing. Despite Somers' earlier belief that her son would not want to see his mother nude, her then 18-year-old son did view the second pictorial. Spokeswoman for the Thighmaster During the 1980s, Somers became a Las Vegas entertainer. In the early 1990s, she was the spokeswoman in a series of infomercials for the Thighmaster, a piece of exercise equipment that is squeezed between one's thighs. During this period of her career, she also performed for U.S. servicemen overseas.<ref>O'Connor, John J., \"TV: Suzanne Somers Plays for G.I.

In people who got 50 milligrams of the drug injected once every two weeks, LDL levels dropped by 40%. The most effective dose was 150 milligrams every two weeks, which lowered LDL by 72%. In contrast, LDL levels dropped only 5% in people who got the placebo. \"It takes us to a whole new level of cholesterol control and could be a game changer in the future,\" he tells WebMD. The new drug works differently than statins do. This, in turn, clears LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Statin drugs work in a different way to remove LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. While credited with making a substantial dent in heart disease, they don't help everyone. About 1 in 3 people with high LDL levels is resistant to statins or does not get enough benefit, leaving them at risk for heart attacks if they don't get additional treatment, McKenney says. Serious side effects occurred in one person on placebo and in three people on the new drug, including one case of severe rash accompanied by diarrhea. At the meeting, Amgen presented findings from an earlier stage study of 51 people showing monthly injections of AMG 145 substantially lowered LDL when given on top of statins. Both studies are too small and too short to draw any conclusions about the drugs' safety, Raymond Gibbons, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and a past president of the American Heart Association, tells WebMD. This REGN727 study was funded by Sanofi U.S. and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which make the drug. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included 27,564 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and LDL cholesterol levels of 70 mg per deciliter. Needham analyst Chad Messer said in a note to clients that Esperion's drug, bempedoic acid, has a different method of reducing \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. A year and a half after its feted approval, a new cholesterol drug has passed a key test. Those benefits are clinically significant, not just statistically significant, and in a conference call hosted by Mizuho Securities USA Inc.'s senior biotech analyst Salim Syed, James Underberg, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York University Medical School and president-elect of the national lipid association, stressed the good news about the results. \"There are an very bad lot of people with really quite high cholesterol out there and we'll probably need more than one drug to get their levels down\". Almost all were taking modest or large doses of statins. \"The end result was cholesterol levels came down and down and down, and we've seen cholesterol levels lower than we have ever seen before in the practice of medicine\". \"Now we have more confidence that not only are we are helping on the biochemistry reports numbers, but also helping keep patients out of emergency rooms and cardiac operating theatres\". inhibitors have been researched to improve HDL concentrations, but so far, despite dramatically increasing HDL-C, have not had a consistent track record in reducing atherosclerosis disease events. Some have increased mortality rates compared with placebo. ; Clofibrate is effective at lowering cholesterol levels, but has been associated with significantly increased cancer and stroke mortality, despite lowered cholesterol levels. fenofibric acid have had a better track record and are primarily promoted for lowering VLDL particles (triglycerides), not LDL particles, yet can help some in combination with other strategies. ; Some Tocotrienols, especially delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, are being promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having been shown in vitro to have an effect. In particular, gamma-tocotrienol appears to be another \n\n how much lower. Statin drugs involved in such clinical trials have numerous physiological effects beyond simply the reduction of LDL levels. For reference, from longitudinal population studies following progression of \n\nAdding the 'investigational biologic' evolocumab to statin therapy works better, study says. Adding an experimental new biologic drug to conventional cholesterol-lowering drugs may result in better cholesterol control and reduced risks of heart attack and stroke, according to a new study. The findings were published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's maker, Amgen. The patients were offered an opportunity to join a one-year extension trial. The researchers randomly assigned patients to either standard treatment -- usually with cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins -- or to standard treatment as well as the new drug. The new drug works by blocking a protein that reduces the liver's ability to remove LDL -- or so-called ''bad'' -- cholesterol from the blood, the researchers explained. \"This is a new class of drugs. \"Statins will always be the foundation of therapy. Those on the biologic were about half as likely to have a heart attack or stroke over the one-year follow-up. Those getting the combination treatment reduced their bad cholesterol by about 70 milligrams per deciliter of blood, down to about 48 milligrams per deciliter. The drugs, known as PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, \"have demonstrated impressive reductions in LDL levels,'' said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. While those on the combination therapy had half the risk of heart attack and stroke as those on standard statin therapy, the difference between the two groups was small -- only about 1 percent. A second preliminary study to be presented Sunday at the cardiology meeting found that another experimental drug, alirocumab, also lowered levels of LDL cholesterol when combined with statin therapy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

References\n\nExternal links\nVisine webpage\nSnopes reference\n\nOphthalmology drugs\nJohnson & Johnson brands\n\nVisine  is a brand of eye drops produced by Johnson & Johnson. Visine Original\nThe active ingredients in the original Visine formulation are potassium chloride and tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride which is a vasoconstrictor, and therefore constricts the eye's superficial blood vessels. Administration\n\nVisine is administered topically with 1 to 2 drops applied to the affected eye(s) up to 4 times daily . Adverse effects\n\nThose using Visine Original frequently report stinging and burning upon application. These drops are also not advised for contact lens wearers because decreased blood flow to the surface of the eye will further lower the levels of oxygen available to the eye. Visine is not to be used by patients with glaucoma since the production of more liquids only contributes to the problem of high pressure within the eye. Side effects\nA common urban legend is that a few drops of Visine in an unsuspecting victim's drink will cause harmless but debilitating bouts of explosive diarrhea, akin to that of a laxative. This will not produce explosive diarrhea, but oral administration of Visine can induce dangerous side effects related to Visine's ingredient tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride such as:\n\nDangerously low body temperature (hypothermia)\nBlurred vision\nNausea and vomiting (as opposed to explosive diarrhea)\nDifficulty in breathing or even a complete halt in breathing\nElevating (hypertension) then dropping (hypotension) blood pressure\nPossible coma\nSeizures and tremors\nDeath\n\nAnyone ingesting Visine should get medical attention or contact a poison control center immediately.

Indications: Kyleena is a progestin-containing intrauterine system (IUS) indicated for prevention of pregnancy for up to 5 years. • Release rate of levonorgestrel (LNG) is 17.5 mcg/day after 24 days and declines to 7.4 mcg/day after 5 years; Kyleena must be removed or replaced after 5 years. • To be inserted by a trained healthcare provider using strict aseptic technique. • Patient should be re-examined and evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after insertion; then yearly or more often if clinically indicated. Safety and efficacy: The contraceptive efficacy of Kyleena was evaluated in a clinical trial that enrolled generally healthy women aged 18 to 35, of whom 1,452 received Kyleena. About 71% of 163 women who desired pregnancy after study discontinuation and provided follow-up information, conceived within 12 months after removal of Kyleena. FDA approves Bayer’s Kyleena (levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system) 19.5 mg for prevention of pregnancy for up to five years. The agency announced that its Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel would conduct an evidence-based review of Essure's safety in September 2015 due to the rise in adverse event reports from only 950 reports between 2002 through October 2013, to more than 4,150, or 81 percent of the total, from October 2013 to June 2015. In February 2016, the FDA issued a \"black box\" label to warn the public about the harmful complications associated with the use of this device and requested Bayer to conduct a new postmarket surveillance to follow 2,000 women for at least three years, comparing the effectiveness and safety of the device with other surgical contraceptive methods. Hormonal methods which contain the hormones estrogen and progestin include oral contraceptive pills (there is also a progestin only pill), transdermal patch (OrthoEvra), and intravaginal ring (NuvaRing). Progestin only methods include an injectable form (Depo-Provera), a subdermal implant (Nexplanon), and the intrauterine device (Mirena). Non-hormonal contraceptive methods include the copper intrauterine device (ParaGard), male and female condoms, male and female sterilization, cervical diaphragms and sponges, spermicides, withdrawal, and fertility awareness. In 2006–2008, the most popular contraceptive methods among those at risk of unintended pregnancy were oral contraceptive pills (25%), female sterilization (24.2%), male condoms (14.5%), male sterilization (8.8%), intrauterine device (4.9%), withdrawal (4.6%).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

They last met in the 1978 Preliminary Round where Buffalo won in three games. Buffalo won all four games during this year's regular season series. Sabres co-captain Chris Drury scored the tying goal with less than eight seconds remaining and Maxim Afinogenov ended the game 4:39 into the first overtime on the power-play as Buffalo won game five 2–1. Two days later, the Lightning announced that forward Jonathan Drouin is expected to miss three-to-four weeks with a thumb fracture. Drouin will continue to skate on his own until he is cleared to resume practicing with the team again. During the event, the team unveiled their new third jersey for the upcoming season. In the Blackhawks’ penultimate 2016–17 regular season game, Nick Ritchie of the Anaheim Ducks punched Rozsíval in the face as retaliation for a cross-check he delivered to Corey Perry. Rozsíval suffered a facial fracture that required surgical repairs. The NHL suspended Ritchie for two games (one regular season and one playoff game) on the basis that Ritchie's punch was unexpected and Rozsíval was not prepared to fight or defend himself. Rozsíval missed the Blackhawks 2016–17 finale and the entire 2017 playoffs due to the injury. He was later diagnosed with post-concussion symptoms and was placed on the Blackhawks long-term disabled list before the 2017–18 NHL season. In his third game, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Catenacci was injured by a check from Radko Gudas. After spending a week on the injured reserve list, Catenacci was reassigned to Rochester on February 19. He finished the season playing in 11 games with Buffalo, scoring no points. During the 2016–17 season, Catenacci was dealt by the Sabres at the trade deadline to the New York Rangers in exchange for defenseman Mat Bodie on February 28, 2017.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome Zika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy The disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. Whether the stage of pregnancy at which the mother becomes infected affects the risk to the fetus is not well understood, nor is whether other risk factors affect outcomes. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause Reservoir Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology In fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis It is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients. However, the period of viremia can be short and the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends RT-PCR testing be done on serum collected within 1 to 3 days of symptom onset or on saliva samples collected during the first 3 to 5 days. Serological cross-reactions with closely related flaviviruses such as dengue and West Nile virus as well as vaccines to flaviviruses are possible. As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection.

As of 2019, the FDA has authorized two tests to detect Zika virus antibodies. Because health officials noticed an alarming spike in babies born with unusually small heads, a condition called microcephaly. ​When a new, devastating, and unexplained medical condition suddenly appears in large numbers like the microcephaly cases in Brazil, the first question any thinking person should ask is why? The answer we’ve been given is Zika, a mosquito-borne viral infection that usually causes nothing more than mild self-resolving symptoms, including a rash and low-grade fever. ​The reason that Zika is a possible suspect is because six infants (yes, only six) out of 270 confirmed cases of babies with microcephaly and brain damage were found to have Zika. It is possible that Zika is causing microcephaly, but the evidence suggests that it is highly unlikely. If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. If that weren’t enough to give any thinking person pause about the risk to the unborn child of injecting aluminum into the mom, the safety of giving Tdap has never been tested on pregnant women. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. I held a newborn in my arms who had a severely deformed and tiny head, CRS. ​Congenital rubella can also occur when a newly pregnant woman or a woman about to get pregnant is given the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR). The CDC warns that the MMR vaccine, “should not be administered to women known to be pregnant. Because a risk to the fetus from administration of these live virus vaccines cannot be excluded for theoretical reasons, women should be counseled to avoid becoming pregnant for 28 days after vaccination with measles or mumps vaccines or MMR or other rubella-containing vaccines” (Source). ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Perhaps it is the MMR vaccine, not the Zika virus, that is the real culprit? Stop the Tdap vaccination of pregnant women: the risks of this vaccine to a developing fetus outweigh the benefits. Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. Pharmaceutical companies and biotech firms are in a fast and furious race to develop another vaccine … against the Zika virus. It has not caused any reported deaths during the initial infection. Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy can cause microcephaly and other brain malformations in some babies. Infections in adults have been linked to Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS). There is no effective vaccine. An outbreak started in Brazil in 2015, and spread to the Americas, Pacific, Asia, and Africa. This led the World Health Organization to declare it a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. Otherwise the most common signs and symptoms of Zika fever are fever, rash, conjunctivitis (red eyes), muscle and joint pain, and headache, which are similar to signs and symptoms of dengue and chikungunya fever. The disease lasts for several days to a week and is usually mild enough that people do not have to go to a hospital. Due to being in the same family as dengue, there has been concern that it could cause similar bleeding disorders. However that has only been documented in one case, with blood seen in semen, also known as hematospermia. Guillain–Barré syndrome Zika virus infections have been strongly associated with Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS), which is a rapid onset of muscle weakness caused by the immune system damaging the peripheral nervous system, and which can progress to paralysis. Pregnancy The disease spreads from mother to child in the womb and can cause multiple problems, most notably microcephaly, in the baby. The full range of birth defects caused by infection during pregnancy is not known, but they appear to be common, with large scale abnormalities seen in up to 42% of live births. The most common observed associations have been abnormalities with brain and eye development such as microcephaly and chorioretinal scarring. Whether the stage of pregnancy at which the mother becomes infected affects the risk to the fetus is not well understood, nor is whether other risk factors affect outcomes. One group has estimated the risk of a baby developing microcephaly at about 1% when the mother is infected during the first trimester, with the risk of developing microcephaly becoming uncertain beyond the first trimester. Affected babies might appear normal but actually have brain abnormalities; infection in newborns could also lead to brain damage. Cause Reservoir Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus closely related to the dengue and yellow fever viruses. While mosquitoes are the vector, the main reservoir species remains unknown, though serological evidence has been found in both West African monkeys and rodents. There have also been cases of men with no symptoms of Zika virus infection transmitting the disease. The CDC has recommended that all men who have travelled to affected areas should wait at least 6 months before trying to attempt conception, regardless of whether they were ill. To date there have been no reported sexual transmissions from women to their sexual partners. The U.S. FDA has recommended universal screening of blood products for Zika. The virus is detected in 3% of asymptomatic blood donors in French Polynesia. Pathophysiology In fruit flies microcephaly appears to be caused by the flavivirid virus protein NS4A, which can disrupt brain growth by hijacking a pathway which regulates growth of new neurons. Diagnosis It is difficult to diagnose Zika virus infection based on clinical signs and symptoms alone due to overlaps with other arboviruses that are endemic to similar areas. In addition to dengue, other considerations include leptospirosis, malaria, rickettsia, group A streptococcus, rubella, measles, and parvovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, and alphavirus infections (e.g., chikungunya, Mayaro, Ross River, Barmah Forest, O'nyong'nyong, and Sindbis viruses).\" In small case series, routine chemistry and complete blood counts have been normal in most patients.

In many cases, visual impairments can be corrected. If your child's visual impairment is serious, give yourself time to adjust. One in 20 preschoolers and 1 in 4 school-age children have vision problems, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Glasses can usually improve it. If detected early, temporarily patching the normal eye may resolve the problem by forcing the brain to use the affected eye. Amblyopia, also know as \"lazy eye,\" occurs when vision in one eye is reduced. Cortical visual impairment (CVI). Not enough oxygen to the brain, brain injury, or infections such as encephalitis and meningitis can cause CVI. It can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment and blindness. If more severe, ROP can result in permanent vision impairment or blindness. Genetically transmitted visual impairments. Infantile cataracts (a cloudy lens) and congenital glaucoma (a disorder that damages the optic nerve) often run in families. They can cause vision impairment. This is particularly important if your child has risk factors or a family history of eye problems. Children need their vision checked at infancy, 6 months, between 3 and 3 1/2 years, and upon entering school, around the age of 5. Visually impaired children can have learning problems that range from mild to severe. Check in with your child and your child's teachers often to make sure that he or she is thriving at school and that appropriate support is in place to meet your child's needs. If your child's visual impairment is severe, he or she may need help from other specialists to develop life skills. Specialists in low-vision rehabilitation and mobility are trained to help visually impaired children adapt to their environment and develop independence. Today, there are also many low-vision devices and adaptive technologies that will help your child communicate, learn, and lead an independent life.

Prevent Blindness America: \"Signs of Possible Eye Problems in Children\" and \"Guidelines for Children's Vision Health.\" Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), also known as Cerebral Visual Impairment, is a form of neurological blindness that affects the way children interpret visual information. While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. Testing usually consists of object identification and perception tasks including:\n\nAt the start of each school year, teachers all over the country are receiving class lists with a growing number of children being labelled as having an impairment/disability that greatly impacts on their ability to learn. Labels such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder are becoming so common place, that teachers themselves are expected to not only recognise children with these labels, but to also provide appropriate support for them within the classroom setting. But what if this new label could actually explain many of the difficulties a child is experiencing and may actually result in the removal of some of the other labels? This is potentially the case for children affected by aspects of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI). CVI is an umbrella term for a number of visual issues related to the brain that affect the way a person sees the world around them. Although CVI has recently been recognised as the most common cause of visual impairment in children in the developed world, the vast continuum of visual difficulties associated with this umbrella term means that many of our children are not being correctly diagnosed. At one end of the CVI continuum, there are children who are functionally blind and don’t appear to be able to “see” the world around them. Fortunately, these children are more likely to receive an overall diagnosis of CVI, as their visual issues are more obvious. However, at the other end of the continuum, are children who may appear to have normal or near normal visual acuity when assessed by an optometrist (meaning that they are able to read to a level on the eye chart that is considered within normal range i.e. Despite having normal or near normal visual acuity however, many children are greatly affected by what is commonly referred to as visual perceptual difficulties. - fatigues easily and appears to get frustrated / anxious easily. Another important aspect of visual perceptual difficulties, is that these issues are made worse when the environment around a person with these difficulties is cluttered. When children are diagnosed with certain impairments such as: ADHD, ASD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and Auditory Processing Disorder, tools and teaching strategies are implemented in the classroom to help ensure the child has the same opportunities to learn as his or her peers. But if the child has been incorrectly diagnosed with one of those conditions, as a result of the similarities between visual perceptual difficulties and these impairments, or they have visual perceptual difficulties in addition to another impairment, the interventions being used may not be as effective as they could be. To help provide an optimal learning environment for not only children with visual perceptual difficulties, but for all children, the first step any teacher needs to take, is to look closely at their classroom environment and get a feel for how cluttered it actually is. To learn more about this common yet often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed condition, tune in for part two of this blog series on visual perceptual difficulties.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. The term \"necrotizing fasciitis\" first came into use in 1952. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. Bacteria Types of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods, (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Diagnosis Early diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis.

Is it possible to prevent necrotizing fasciitis? Is necrotizing fasciitis contagious? What are some additional sources of information on necrotizing fasciitis? Treatment of an infection caused by flesh-eating bacteria involves rapid antibiotic administration and/or surgical debridement of the wound areas as well as supportive measures such as insertion of a breathing tube, intravenous administration of fluids, and drugs to support the cardiovascular system. Good hygiene and wound care can reduce the chance of developing the disease; necrotizing fasciitis is not usually contagious but it is possible to transmit infectious agents to other people (cross-contaminations of wounds, for example). The prognosis depends on how fast the infection is diagnosed and treated and the patient’s response to treatments; outcomes usually range from fair to poor with complications including tissue loss and or amputation of limbs. Popular publications and the media term necrotizing fasciitis as a \"flesh eating\" or \"skin eating\" disease or infection. In addition, the organisms that typically cause necrotizing fasciitis are termed \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or \"flesh-eating parasites\" because of the rapid rate with which they can infect and kill human tissue. It is likely that the disease had been occurring for many centuries before it was first described in the 1800s. Currently, there are many names that have been used loosely to mean the same disease as necrotizing fasciitis: flesh-eating bacterial infection or flesh-eating disease; suppurative fasciitis; dermal, Meleney, hospital, or Fournier's gangrene; and necrotizing cellulitis. Body regions frequently have the term necrotizing placed before them to describe the initial localization of necrotizing fasciitis (for example, necrotizing colitis, necrotizing arteriolitis), but they all refer to the same disease process in the tissue. Fortunately, this disease is relatively rare; various statistical sources estimate about 500 to 1,500 individuals are reported to have the disease per year in the U.S. Statistics show mortality (death) rates have been reported as high as 75% for necrotizing fasciitis associated with Fournier's (scrotal) gangrene, but the mortality in patients with the infection in other regions of the body (for example, legs or arms) is about 25%. Variations of necrotizing fasciitis are placed by some investigators into three general groups or types, roughly based on the type of organisms causing the infection and some clinical findings that vary from patient to patient. Type 1 is either caused by more than one bacterial genera (polymicrobial) or by the infrequently found single bacterial genus such as Vibrio vulnificus or fungal genera such as Candida. Type 2 is caused by Streptococcus bacteria, and type 3 (or termed type 3 gas gangrene) is caused by Clostridium bacteria. Bacteria cause most cases of necrotizing fasciitis; only rarely do other organisms such as fungi cause this disease. Group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, either alone or with other bacteria, cause many cases of necrotizing fasciitis, although Clostridium bacteria should be considered as a cause especially if gas is found in the infected tissue. Because of better microbial isolation techniques for anaerobic (grow in the absence of oxygen) bacteria, bacterial genera such as Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Clostridium are often cultured from the infected area. Frequently, culture of tissue involved by necrotizing fasciitis also yields a mixture of other aerobic (require oxygen to grow) bacterial types such as E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, and others. Many investigators conclude that non-anaerobic organisms damage tissue areas enough to cause local areas of hypoxia (reduced oxygen) where anaerobic organisms then can thrive and extend the infection further. This results in polymicrobial infection in which one type of bacteria aids the survival and growth of another type of bacteria (synergy). Infrequently, Vibrio vulnificus causes the disease when a person, usually someone with liver function problems (for example, alcoholics or immunosuppressed patients), eats contaminated seafood or a wound gets contaminated with seawater containing Vibrio vulnificus. Other organisms may rarely cause necrotizing fasciitis, but when they do, the resulting infections are often difficult to treat successfully. For example, Aeromonas hydrophila (a Gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium) was the source of this disease in a 24-year-old who cut her thigh in a homemade zip line accident in the U.S. Although Aeromonas hydrophila is usually associated with warm brackish water and causes infections in fish and amphibians, gastroenteritis is the disease it causes most often in humans when the water sources are swallowed. Because it is often resistant to multiple antibiotics, it is difficult to eradicate if it infects human tissues. In addition, once it infects tissues, its enzymes and toxins allow a rapid entrance of the organisms to the bloodstream, causing sepsis and infection of other body organs. In general, the bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis utilize similar methods to cause and advance the disease. In polymicrobial infections, one bacterial genus may produce one toxic factor (for example, E. coli causing tissue hypoxia) while different types of coinfecting bacteria may produce other toxins that lyse (disintegrate) damaged tissue cells or connective tissue. In general, this disease is not contagious, but the organisms that may lead to its development are contagious, usually by direct contact between people or items that can transfer the bacteria. People usually need a break in their skin (cut, abrasion) for these flesh-eating bacteria to cause disease. Theoretically, anyone with an infection has a small risk of getting necrotizing fasciitis; the risk factors begin to increase if the infection occurs in immunosuppressed individuals (for example, diabetics, elderly, infants, those with liver disease, or those taking immunosuppressive drugs such as chemotherapy for cancer). Visible infections (skin, hair follicles, fingernails, visible trauma sites) are more likely to be noticed and treated than some deep infections. Patients who have any deep infections (muscle, bone, joint, gastrointestinal) are at somewhat higher risk for the disease because the initial infection and subsequent spread is usually not as noticeable as more visible infections. Necrotizing enterocolitis occurs mainly in premature or sick infants and may be another variant of necrotizing fasciitis, but there is still controversy about the cause of this disease. Necrotizing fasciitis has interesting demographics; more males than females are affected (about three to one), and Vibrio vulnificus infections\n\nNecrotizing fasciitis (NF), also known as flesh-eating disease, is a bacterial infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue.

Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? Though still rare, the potential risks are significant enough for the Food and Drug Administration to suggest limiting these drugs’ use to cases of absolute necessity. The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture. The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery…ect [sic]…may have already damaged you. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. Fluoroquinolones cross the blood brain barrier. In the case of fluoroquinolones, there are indeed serious risks that need to be considered, especially when other classes of antibiotics may be effective. They are also contraindicated in children due to the risks of damage to the musculoskeletal system. Tendon damage (especially to Achilles tendon but also other tendons) can occur within 48 hours of starting fluoroquinolone treatment but the damage may be delayed several months after stopping treatment. The overall rate of adverse events in people treated with fluoroquinolones is roughly similar to that seen in people treated with other antibiotic classes. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found people treated with fluoroquinolones experienced adverse events severe enough to lead to an emergency department visit more frequently than those treated with cephalosporins or macrolides, but less frequently than those treated with penicillins, clindamycin, sulfonamides, \n\n the labels to describe the potential for irreversible peripheral neuropathy (serious nerve damage). In November 2015, an FDA Advisory Committee discussed the risks and benefits of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs based on new safety information. The advisory committee concluded that the serious risks associated with the use of fluoroquinolones for these types of uncomplicated infections generally outweighed the benefits for patients with other treatment options. The 21-member joint \n\n More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of \"black box\" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression,\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus Detection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. Samples can be obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material), throat swabs, deep airway material collected via suction catheter or saliva. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Thereafter the virus may abandon the throat and multiply in the lungs. In the second week, sputum or deep airways collection is preferred. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. They are faster than PCR because they don't involve repeated heating and cooling cycles. Antigen tests An antigen is the part of a pathogen that elicits an immune response. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. Antigen tests may be one way to scale up testing to much greater levels. RT-PCR tests are accurate but require too much time, energy and trained personnel to run the tests. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children).

This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms.

However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is also an anti-abortion community, much of it centered on religious groups. Terminology The abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"induced abortion\" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one. The term elective abortion or voluntary abortion describes the interruption of pregnancy before viability at the request of the woman, but not for medical reasons. Anti-abortion advocates tend to use terms such as \"unborn baby\", \"unborn child\", or \"pre-born child\", and see the medical terms \"embryo\", \"zygote\", and \"fetus\" as dehumanizing. The Associated Press encourages journalists to use the terms \"abortion rights\" and \"anti-abortion\". Context Free birth control correlates to teenage girls having a fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. A 2014 New England Journal of Medicine study found such a link. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states have legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. History Legislative history In 1849, the state legislature passed a law that criminalized abortion, making it a felony for a doctor to perform an abortion on a woman, no matter the circumstances of her pregnancy. The state was one of 23 states in 2007 to have a detailed abortion-specific informed consent requirement. In 2012, Governor Walker and the Republican controlled legislature repealed the Healthy Youth Act, which required schools to provide students scientifically-accurate and age-appropriate information on contraception as one method to help prevent STIs and unplanned births. However, this was replaced with a requirement for abstinence-only education, in which schools are to teach that \"abstinence is the only reliable way to prevent pregnancy and avoid sexually transmitted infections.\" In mid-May 2019, state law banned abortion after week 22. Specifically, the legislature passed a measure requiring abortion physicians to provide information on abortion reversal – a procedure that the scientific community sees as illegitimate and invalid, as it is not based upon medically-sound research. In addition, the legislature passed a bill that would eliminate all government funding for Planned Parenthood, as well as a ban on all abortions based upon the race, sex, or genetic anomaly of the fetus. Evers also vetoed a bill that would sentence doctors to life in prison for failing to provide infants with medical care if they are born alive during a botched abortion attempt. The state's primary argument in defense of the admitting privileges requirement centers on women's health. Specifically, if complications arise, this requirement presumes a continuity of care for the patient. The court's ruling, however, determined that the remarkably low rates of complications associated with abortion, and the state's failure to impose similar requirements on physicians providing riskier procedures rendered these claims moot. 53% of adults said in a poll by the Pew Research Center that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. However, the Center for Reproductive Rights in its What if Roe Fell website labels the state as hostile towards abortion rights e.g., 20-week ban, telemedicine ban, TRAP requirements, admitting privileges requirement, transfer agreement requirement, reporting requirement, parental consent required, mandatory counseling, mandatory ultrasound and waiting period requirements. There is also an anti-abortion community, much of it centered on religious groups. Terminology The abortion debate most commonly relates to the \"induced abortion\" of an embryo or fetus at some point in a pregnancy, which is also how the term is used in a legal sense. Some also use the term \"elective abortion\", which is used in relation to a claim to an unrestricted right of a woman to an abortion, whether or not she chooses to have one.

The virus previously had a provisional name, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and has also been called human coronavirus 2019 (HCoV-19 or hCoV-19). SARS‑CoV‑2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that is contagious in humans. As described by the US National Institutes of Health, it is the successor to SARS-CoV-1, the virus that caused the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak. SARS‑CoV‑2 is a virus of the species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV). It is of zoonotic origins and has close genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, suggesting it emerged from a bat-borne virus. The virus shows little genetic diversity, indicating that the spillover event introducing SARS‑CoV‑2 to humans is likely to have occurred in late 2019. However, some subsequent variants have become more infectious. This was in accordance with WHO's 2015 guidance against using geographical locations, animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names. On 11 February 2020, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official name \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS‑CoV‑2). To avoid confusion with the disease SARS, the WHO sometimes refers to SARS‑CoV‑2 as \"the COVID-19 virus\" in public health communications and the name HCoV-19 was included in some research articles. Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission Human-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2.

Referring to COVID-19 as the \"Wuhan virus\" has been described as dangerous by WHO officials, and as xenophobic by University of California at Berkeley Asian American studies lecturer Harvey Dong. Infection and transmission Human-to-human transmission of SARS‑CoV‑2 was confirmed on 20 January 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. During human-to-human transmission, between 200 and 800 infectious SARS‑CoV‑2 virions are thought to initiate a new infection. The duration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding is generally between 3 and 46 days after symptom onset. Studies have identified a range of animals—such as cats, ferrets, hamsters, non-human primates, minks, tree shrews, raccoon dogs, fruit bats, and rabbits—that are susceptible and permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, a study of ninety-four patients hospitalized in January and February 2020 estimated patients shed the most virus two to three days before symptoms appear and that \"a substantial proportion of transmission probably occurred before first symptoms in the index case\". It is not known how common reinfection is, but reports have indicated that it is occurring with variable severity. Since genomic analyses showed significant genetic differences between the SARS‑CoV‑2 variant sampled on those two dates, the case study authors determined this was a reinfection. Reservoir and origin The first known infections from SARS‑CoV‑2 were discovered in Wuhan, China. The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the virus became pathogenic before or after the spillover event. Because many of the early infectees were workers at the Huanan Seafood Market, it has been suggested that the virus might have originated from the market. For a virus recently acquired through a cross-species transmission, rapid evolution is expected. For comparison, the viral mutation rate in vivo of SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be lower than that of influenza. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that a virus from Rhinolophus affinis, collected in Yunnan province and designated RaTG13, has a 96.1% resemblance to SARS‑CoV‑2.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

PIP implants refer to a type of silicone based breast implant manufactured in France by a company called Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP). as a part of the breast reconstruction process or used cosmetically to augment small breasts. An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat. This study investigated whether breast implants are associated with abnormal ECG recordings. The boss of the French company which distributed the defective breast implants was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud. And despite reports and conjectures showing adverse health impacts of breast implants, there are still women who consider having breast implants,\" the bill's authors noted. There have been roughly 60 cases of ALCL in women with breast implants worldwide, according to the FDA. According to a Dubai-based plastic surgeon, breast implants procedures are much in demand in the UAE. In response to concerns about breast implants and possible cancer risk, the Israeli Health Ministry has taken several measures. Furthermore, the Israeli Health Ministry has banned the use of Poly Implant Prostheses (PIP) implants in Israel. These implants, which have a higher than normal rupture rate and have been linked to cases of cancer, are no longer allowed for use in cosmetic procedures. Additionally, the French government has offered to cover the costs of removing the PIP implants for 30,000 women who have them. This action has further highlighted the concerns surrounding these implants and the potential risks they may pose. Overall, the Israeli Health Ministry has taken the issue seriously by implementing measures such as the hotline and the ban on PIP implants to address the concerns and ensure the safety of patients. Despite reassurance surrounding the controversial breast implants at the centre of a global health scare, fear is continuing to spread. Israel”s Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. The decision was prompted by the French Government”s announcement that it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, to have them removed. Theyhave a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from arare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. Ithas also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coatingdesigned to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Shesaid ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from theNetherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Maltaand Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. The European commission aims to strengthen oversight of companies that certify medical devices following a breast implant scandal thought to have affected at least 400,000 women worldwide. The low-grade breast implants produced by the now closed French manufacture Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) were made available in nearly all member states with the largest concentration in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Germany. The implants - containing silicone made for use in mattresses - were banned in 2010 but France caused waves in December last year when it issued a cancer alert and advised French women to have the implants removed. The report found that “data available today was insufficient to lead to firm conclusions regarding the health risks for women with PIP silicone breast implants”. The evidence of health risks for women with PIP silicon breast implants, it concluded, is weak. But proven fraud, possible sub-standard screening processes in Europe, and recent revelations that the United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) banned the company in 2000 are causing concern among MEPs in the European parliament. PIP obtained a permit for its saline implants in 1997 from the German certification company, TUV Rheinland. The manufacturer declared a medical-grade silicone but instead used an industrial alternative that is around ten times less expensive saving the company around €1.2 million per year, according to Reuters. The FDA issued a warning letter to the company's founder, Jean-Claude Mas, and then banned PIP saline implants in the United States in 2000 after inspecting the manufacturer’s premises in southern France. The FDA agent who inspected the site in 2000 said the implants had been “adulterated”, according to press reports. The same plant in southern France was manufacturing the silicone implants generating the current uproar. Authorities are unable to determine which people received which implants. In Denmark, one clinic closed and destroyed all its documents once it was discovered that it had used some PIP implants. The women treated at the clinic have no idea if they are carrying anyone of the implants classified as potentially dangerous. McAvan is now pushing for a EU-wide system that improves traceability of the implants and wants the commission to implement an EU-level barcode that identifies every item. Euro-MPs are pressing for a ban on breast implants for under-18 year olds as part of an EU-wide campaign for tougher health and safety regulations on silicone gel products. The European Commission has promised to re-write EU legislation on medical devices to avoid a repeat of the breast implant scandal involving French-firm Poly Implant Prothese which emerged last year. After recent implant scandals, revised EU legislation should make medical devices subject to more stringent tests, but health ministers are dragging their feet.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, experts are skeptical about this claim and do not recommend using fenugreek for testosterone enhancement. It is important to note that men need some estrogen to support their bones and sex drive, and blocking the enzyme aromatase, as fenugreek is claimed to do, can lead to accelerated bone loss. There is also debate about the role of zinc in increasing testosterone levels. It is important to approach the use of these popular supplements with caution and consult with a healthcare professional before starting any testosterone-enhancing regimen. By maintaining a healthy skepticism, clinicians, patients, and policy makers can avoid falling into the trap of relying on unproven or ineffective treatments. This sounds good in theory, but the research—and my experience with it—hasn't panned out.

Meningococcemia, another manifestation of meningococcal disease, is a bloodstream infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. In some cases, meningococcemia can cause blood clotting problems, leading to purpura fulminans, a condition characterized by extensive skin necrosis and organ damage. It is important to note that meningococcal disease can progress rapidly and become life-threatening, so prompt medical attention is crucial. If you or someone you know exhibits symptoms suggestive of meningococcal disease, it is important to seek immediate medical care. While best known as a cause of meningitis, it can also result in sepsis, which is an even more damaging and dangerous condition. Such observations have been seen to support the concept that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be capable of triggering a severe form of a Kawasaki-like disease. In Russia, 13 children had been treated (5 with intensive care) by mid-June for a multisystem inflammatory syndrome at the Morozov Children's Hospital in Moscow, including a 2-year-old girl with the COVID-19 infection who died on 23 May following an initial diagnosis of suspected Kawasaki disease. In Iran, a case report (first submitted in May) described severe MIS-C in a 5-year-old girl who had presented with shock and was initially diagnosed with Kawasaki disease, and further cases of the new syndrome have been recorded. In India, a \n\nNeisseria meningitidis infection, commonly known as meningococcal infection, is indeed a significant cause of meningitis in children. Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, and Neisseria meningitidis is one of the leading pathogens responsible for this condition. It is a bacterium that can cause severe illness, including meningitis and bloodstream infections. Meningococcal infections can occur at any age, but children, particularly those aged 6 months to 2 years, are more susceptible to this infection. Consequently, environments like daycare centers and schools can facilitate the transmission of the infection. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize the symptoms of a Neisseria meningitidis infection, which may include high fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, vomiting, and a characteristic rash. Vaccination is also available to prevent some types of meningococcal infections, and it is recommended for infants, preteens, and certain high-risk groups.

Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis. nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis and given Lyrica. I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation Yes. Nine out of ten or 90% of people with RA test positive for ACPA and the test is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of arthritis. Similar to RF, a patient may test positive for ACPA even before the signs and symptoms of … Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. Lab tests aren’t perfect—you can test … Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the immune system that is designed to protect the body by attacking foreign substances like viruses or bacteria. The normal action of the immune system is affected when the autoimmune disease mistakenly attacks the joints. Medical tests for psoriatic arthritis #5: Rheumatoid factor (RF) Rheumatoid factor is a protein antibody produced by the immune system that attacks healthy tissue. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome have positive RF tests. The higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. These tests are used to detect specific antibodies, genetic and immune factors, and certain markers (substances that may Rheumatoid arthritis The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is usually among the last joints involved. Aug 31, 2009 · This test may be useful for monitoring patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, etc.3 However, this is not diagnostic and may rise in other conditions like infections, malignancy, anaemia and some other diseases. An autoantibody is an antibody that is directed against an organism’s own tissues (like in autoimmune diseases). In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, 4 out of 5 people will have RF detectable in their blood. A blood test that measures citrullinated proteins (CPs) could lead to osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses years before the physical symptoms manifest in patients, according to a recent study. Blood Test Aids Early Detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis A blood test that measures the levels of a certain protein can be used in conjunction with clinical assessments to assist with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is now available in North America. Learn more about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by taking the symptoms quiz. This quiz is intended for patients who have been diagnosed with RA. Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests are frequently used to help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also to assess any potential problems with the various drugs that are used to treat RA. All tests DNA Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis. This test cannot be ordered as an individual test but only as a part of the list of diseases included in our Genetic Predisposition Test panel. A blood test is used to detect the presence of rheumatoid factor. The blood test is commonly ordered to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. The more sensitive test identified proteins in the blood that signal heart cells have been dying in seemingly healthy people with no outward signs of heart disease. It was found that where the protein called troponin T were present, the patient was seven times more likely to die from heart disease within the next six years. Dr James de Lemos, associate professor of internal medicine at Southwestern Medical Centre, at University of Texas and lead author of the study said: “This test is among the most powerful predictors of death in the general population we’ve seen so far. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association and follow on from an earlier study which suggested the protein could also predict heart failure, a condition where the organ fails to pump strongly enough causing breathlessness and fatigue. The more sensitive test can detect circulating protein levels in almost everyone with chronic heart failure and chronic coronary artery disease, the authors said. Currently doctors use computer software calculations called the Framingham Score and Qrisk to identify people at high risk of heart disease who could benefit from preventive treatments. People whose levels dropped over time appeared to reduce their risk of heart failure. of life than if going undiagnosed for long after RA's onset. Bone erosion is a central feature of rheumatoid arthritis. One of the main triggers of bone erosion in the joints in rheumatoid arthritis is inflammation of the synovium, caused in part by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL), a cell surface protein present in Th17 cells and osteoblasts. Evidence of osteoarthritis and potentially inflammatory arthritis has been discovered in dinosaurs. The first known traces of human arthritis date back as far as 4500 BC. Researchers in Sweden found that so-called \"biologic\" drugs, known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, or anti-TNFs, slightly reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome -- a condition that includes angina and heart attack in which blood supply to the heart muscle is suddenly blocked. In another study, British scientists also found taking these drugs was associated with a lower risk for heart attack in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. \"It has been known that patients with rheumatoid arthritis have a greater risk of developing heart disease than those without,\" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. In the first study, the Swedish team compared rates of heart disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis taking anti-TNFs with patients not using the drugs and people in the general population, to see if the medications could also cut the risk for heart issues. The study involved a group of more than 7,700 patients in Sweden with rheumatoid arthritis who had never been diagnosed with heart disease. The study revealed the prevalence of heart events was slightly lower among patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were actively taking anti-TNFs than people with rheumatoid arthritis who had never taken this type of medication. After taking other factors into account, such as how long the patients had rheumatoid arthritis, other diseases affecting the patients and socio-economic status, the researchers found that patients actively on the drugs had a 27 percent lower risk for angina/heart attack than patients who had never taken such a drug. \"This nationwide study adds to the evidence that use of TNF inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis also has an impact on cardiovascular [illness],\" study author Dr. Lotta Ljung, a senior consultant in rheumatology at Umea University Hospital, said in a news release issued by the meeting organizers. They also considered whether the severity of heart attacks was in any way affected by treatment with TNF inhibitors. One examined the safety of biologic drugs, the other examined heart attack-related hospitalizations in England and Wales. The study showed that patients taking anti-TNF drugs were at lower risk for heart attack than patients taking traditional DMARDs. However, use of the biologic drugs did not affect the severity of heart attacks, the British team found. His team pointed out, however, that patients with rheumatoid arthritis generally have an increased risk of heart attacks. So, even though anti-TNFs may help curb the risk for heart attacks they do not eliminate it. The U.K. group conclude that patients with rheumatoid arthritis who taking biologic drugs still need to take steps to cut their risk for heart disease. \"Given that these studies demonstrate the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in rheumatoid arthritis, patients should try to mitigate other known cardiovascular risk factors by not smoking and maintaining a healthy diet and weight,\" said Dr. Diane Horowitz, a rheumatologist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.\nFor his part, Ong said it makes \"sense that drugs that reduce inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis could reduce some of the risk of developing heart disease in these same patients.\" The U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases provides more information on rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

If the surgery would have been performed with microsurgery glasses without the robot, the procedure would have lasted around four hours. The technique is likely to be approved by health insurance providers to improve patient treatment quality. The alliance will also provide testing service from home, which mobile health workers will collect blood samples or medical waste from patient’s homes for testing in laboratories. With this platform, users can easily look up the use, price and origins of available drugs, as well as receive updated warnings from health authorities about medicines of questionable quality. The government is preparing to enforce all drug stores to connect to a common network. This aims to adddress issues such as high antibiotic resistance in the country due to sale and purchase of medicines without prescriptions and middlemen in the drug supply chain inflating prices and making it difficult to trace product origins. Such a system will also reduce handwriting errors and solve the the problem of lost or misplaced patient files.

Since January 2020, confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020, under emergency use, beginning the national vaccination program, with the first vaccine officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 23, 2021. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans. Clusters of infections and deaths have occurred in many areas. The COVID-19 pandemic has also led to misinformation and conspiracy theories. Timeline December 2019 to April 2020 In November 2019, COVID-19 infections had first broken out in Wuhan, China. China publicly reported the cluster on December 31, 2019. After China confirmed that the cluster of infections was caused by a novel infectious coronavirus on January 7, 2020, the CDC issued an official health advisory the following day. On January 20, the World Health Organization (WHO) and China both confirmed that human-to-human transmission had occurred. The CDC immediately activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to respond to the outbreak in China. Also, the first report of a COVID-19 case in the U.S. was publicly reported, though the All of Us study (released in 2021) showed five states already had cases weeks earlier. After other cases were reported, on January 30, the WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)its highest level of alarmwarning that \"all countries should be prepared for containment.\" The same day, the CDC confirmed the first person-to-person case in the U.S. Although by that date there were only seven known cases in the U.S., the HHS and CDC reported that there was a likelihood of further cases appearing in the country. The next day, New York City saw the sickening of its \"patient zero\", Manhattan attorney Lawrence Garbuz, then thought to be the first community-acquired case. In February, Vice President Mike Pence took over for Secretary Alex Azar as chair of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the mortality from COVID-19 was ten times higher than the common flu. By March 12, diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. exceeded a thousand. By the middle of March, all fifty states were able to perform tests with a doctor's approval, either from the CDC or from commercial labs. However, the number of available test kits remained limited. May to August 2020 By May 27, less than four months after the pandemic reached the U.S., 100,000 Americans had died with COVID-19. A study conducted in May 2020 indicated that the true number of COVID-19 cases in the United States was much higher than the number of confirmed cases with some locations having 6–24 times higher infections, which was further confirmed by a later population-wide serosurvey. On July 6, the United States Department of State announced the country's withdrawal from WHO effective July 6, 2021. On July 10, the CDC adopted the Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR), \"the number of individuals who die of the disease among all infected individuals (symptomatic and asymptomatic)\", as a new metric for disease severity. In July, US PIRG and 150 health professionals sent a letter asking the federal government to \"shut it down now, and start over\".

The countries and international organizations that have sent aid and funds to the Government of North Macedonia, to help fight the pandemic:\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (). Since January 2020, confirmed cases have been reported in the United States with 948,215 deaths, the most of any country, and the nineteenth-highest per capita worldwide. As many infections have gone undetected, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that, as of May 2021, there could be a total 120.2million infections in the United States, or more than a third of the total population. COVID-19 is the deadliest pandemic in U.S. history; it was the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2020, behind heart disease and cancer. These effects have persisted as U.S. deaths due to COVID-19 in 2021 exceeded those in 2020. On December 31, 2019, China announced the discovery of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan. The first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China, but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing. The government also purchased large quantities of medical equipment, invoking the Defense Production Act of 1950 to assist. COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020, under emergency use, beginning the national vaccination program, with the first vaccine officially approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on August 23, 2021. There has nonetheless been some vaccine hesitancy for various reasons, although side effects are rare. There have also been numerous reports that unvaccinated COVID-19 patients have strained the capacity of hospitals throughout the country, forcing many to turn away patients with life-threatening diseases. The January 2022 emergence of the Omicron variant, which was first discovered in South Africa, has led to record highs in hospitalizations and cases, with as many as 1.5 million new infections reported in a single day. Disproportionate numbers of cases have been observed among Black and Latino populations, as well as elevated levels of vaccine hesitancy, and there has been a sharp increase in reported incidents of xenophobia and racism against Asian Americans.

After training, patients or their carers may inject Hefiya if their doctor considers it appropriate. Eye specialists treating uveitis should also take advice from doctors who have experience of using Hefiya. By attaching to TNF, adalimumab blocks its activity, thereby reducing inflammation and other symptoms of the diseases. In addition Hefiya was as effective as Humira in a study involving 465 patients with moderate or severe plaque psoriasis. The proportion of patients who had at least a 75% reduction in symptoms after 16 weeks of treatment was 68% with Hefiya and 63% with Humira. Because Hefiya is a biosimilar medicine, the studies on effectiveness and safety of adalimumab carried out with Humira do not all need to be repeated for Hefiya. What are the risks associated with Hefiya? The European Medicines Agency decided that, in accordance with EU requirements for biosimilar medicines, Hefiya has a highly similar structure, purity and biological activity to Humira and is distributed in the body in the same way. In addition, a study in psoriasis has shown that the effects of the medicine are equivalent to those of Humira in this condition. All these data were considered sufficient to conclude that Hefiya will behave in the same way as Humira in terms of effectiveness and safety in its approved uses. As for all medicines, data on the use of Hefiya are continuously monitored. Clearside Biomedical announced that their proprietary formulation of triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA) improved vision in patients with macular edema from noninfectious uveitis. pSivida announced in a press release that their injectable corticosteroid insert (Durasert) met its primary efficacy endpoint in a second phase 3 clinical trial for treatment of posterior uveitis. Clearside Biomedical is enrolling participants in a clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of a suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in subjects with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Santen is moving forward with a new drug application for sirolimus intravitreal injection (Opsiria) for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis, despite mixed results from their phase 3 trial, Sakura Study 2. A phase 3 trial shows the investigational drug sarilumab is superior to adalimumab (Humira) for treatment of clinical signs and symptoms of active rheumatoid arthritis in adults. One-year data from a phase 3 trial for pSivida’s sustained-release corticosteroid implant (Medidur) shows it is highly effective in preventing recurrence of posterior uveitis. The FDA has approved the first non-corticosteroid therapy for non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) this week recommended that adalimumab (Humira) be approved for treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adults. Clearside Biomedical announced that a special formulation of triamcinolone acetonide showed good outcomes in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, helps prevent recurrence of posterior uveitis. Medidur, an injectable insert that provides sustained release of flucinolone acetonide for 3 years, may more effectively reduce recurrence and restore vision compared to standard therapy. Valeant Pharmaceuticals International has signed a licensing agreement with EyeGate Pharmaceuticals for a potential alternative to eye drops and injections for anterior uveitis. Early clinical trial results show that uveitis patients treated with a single suprachoroidal injection of triamcinolone acetonide experienced improved vision and no meaningful increase in IOP. Akorn, Inc., confirmed that it has filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to produce a generic version of Alcon’s topical corticosteroid, Durezol. Santen Inc. reports that a global phase 3 study analyzing the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of sirolimus for noninfectious posterior segment uveitis has met its primary endpoint. Sight-threatening lesions are treated for 4–6 weeks with triple therapy consisting of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. During treatment with pyrimethamine, leukocyte and platelet counts should be monitored weekly. Prednisone may be used for 3–6 weeks to reduce macular or optic nerve inflammation and can be started on day 3 of antibiotic therapy. Corticosteroids should not be used without concurrent antibiotic treatment or in immunocompromised patients due to the risk of exacerbation of the disease. Currently, there is no published evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrating that corticosteroids would be an effective adjunct for treating ocular toxoplasmosis. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole has been shown to be equivalent to triple therapy in the treatment of ocular toxoplasmosis and may be better tolerated. Clindamycin and azithromycin can also be considered as alternative therapies. There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Opioids and NSAIDs may be less well tolerated. WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. Uveitis -- a term used to describe a group of inflammatory diseases inside the eye -- can cause loss of vision and potentially lead to blindness, Jaffe explained. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. When the inflammation is quiet, patients are usually treated for about two years. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, which claimed more than 11,000 lives and took several billion dollars to contain, rallied international organizations and countries around the need to align efforts - among themselves and with the private sector - to prepare for future health emergencies. CEPI's targets stem from a World Health Organization research and development blueprint list of priority pathogens that may cause epidemics, but have no vaccines to slow their spread. This list, which aims to cut the time needed to develop candidate products from years to months, is another outcome of the first Ebola wake-up call. The Ebola vaccine illustrates the role of PPPs in helping tackle global epidemics. Between its discovery in 1976 and the beginning of the epidemic in West Africa, the virus infected about 2,400 people and killed less than 1,600. \"Before 2013, Ebola outbreaks had been sporadic, and only affected a small number of people in isolated communities in poor African countries,\" Deputy Chief Executive Director of Gavi Anuradha Gupta told Devex. \"The deal also meant that, when Ebola broke out in the DRC earlier this year, there was a supply of thousands of doses to meet the demand.\" \"Merck donated the doses and worked with WHO to ship them when needed. \"The vaccine is an important additional tool in managing Ebola outbreaks and a major milestone for global public health that has brought hope to the affected community,\" WHO spokesperson Tarik Jarasevic told Devex. Following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, for example, the U.S. funded biodefense research related to Ebola, as did Canada's Department of National Defense, which invested $7 million in developing a vaccine. In Aug. 2014, Canada donated the vaccine for use in Africa and allowed MSD to manufacture it. Another possibility could be having stockpiles in some high-risk countries. \"The DRC is at risk of periodical Ebola outbreaks, so having protocols and in-country supplies could accelerate the response and greatly increase its effectiveness,\" Alía said. This June, there were outbreaks of six of the pathogens on WHO's priority list, he pointed out, including Ebola, Rift Valley fever, and Zika. Hatchett believes one of the main challenges is maintaining public attention to the threat of global epidemics: \"Now we need to keep this issue at the top of people's agenda, so we can prepare for, and not just react, during future outbreaks,\" he said.

On 6 January 2021, the Africa CDC reported that the total number of cases in Africa has reached 2,854,971 while the death toll has reached 67,986 and that 2,361,900 have recovered. On May 21, 2021, 55 member states of the African Union declared 4,732,150 cases, 127,612 deaths, and 4,238,275 recoveries. The Western African Ebola virus epidemic took more than 11,000 lives. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo. The largest outbreak of the Ebola virus from 2014 to 2016. The virus \n\n that \"in the absence of a trajectory toward extinguishing the outbreak, the opposite path—severe escalation—remains possible. The risk of the disease moving into nearby Goma, Congo—a city of 1 million residents with an international airport—or crossing into the massive refugee camps in South Sudan is mounting. Four days later, on 14 July 2019, a case of Ebola was confirmed in Goma, which has an international airport and a highly mobile population. \"The Senate is disturbed that recent reports by media outlets and the World Health Organisation show that the disease is back in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo with 19 dead and 39 infected recorded so far\". The Africa CDC will dispatch a team on Wednesday to the DRC to assess the situation and the level of support required to ongoing efforts by DRC and other partners to contain the outbreak, said John Nkengasong, Director of Africa CDC, during a press briefing on Tuesday at the African Union (AU) headquarters in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. Mortality rates of Ebola fever, according to the World Health Organization, are extremely high, with the human case-fatality rate ranging from 50 percent to 89 percent, depending on viral sub-type. The Ebola vaccination campaign will first target health workers, Ilunga said. \"The remaining 12 cases are suspected...\"\nThe Senate's resolution was sequel to a motion on \"Ebola Virus Disease Outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Need to Take Precautionary Measures\" moved by Senator Oluremi Tinubu (APC-Lagos) during plenary. The last outbreak that was announced a year ago, was contained and declared over by July 2017. There is no specific treatment for Ebola, which is spread through the bodily fluids of people exhibiting symptoms. It was tested in Guinea in 2015. Merck has given its permission for the vaccine to be used in this outbreak. Bikoro Health Zone reported the highest number of cases (n=31), followed by Iboko (n=8) and Mbandaka (n=2) Health Zones. WHO is working with Congo's government and other global organizations, including Medecins Sans Frontieres, to strengthen coordination to fight and contain the Ebola outbreak.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Researchers found the rate of abortion-related complications sending women to the emergency room or requiring a blood transfusion, for example, was one in 625 during 2009 and 2010. “At Planned Parenthood, medical abortion is extremely safe,” said reproductive health researcher James Trussell from Princeton University in New Jersey, who worked on the study. The data came from 233,805 first-trimester abortions done using the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol at 317 Planned Parenthood health centers. In one in 200 of those cases, women had an ongoing pregnancy that wasn’t terminated after two attempts with medication, the researchers reported Thursday in Obstetrics & Gynecology. Eight women each year had an ectopic pregnancy - when the embryo implants outside the uterus - that was diagnosed after the attempted abortion. One died from related complications. Of the 233,805 abortions during the study period, 385 women had a serious side effect, including 238 who sought ER treatment, 135 who were admitted to the hospital, 114 who had a blood transfusion and 57 who required intravenous antibiotics. She told Reuters Health medical abortions are still less common than surgical ones in the U.S., but that they’re becoming relatively more frequent and “women should be reassured” based on these and other data. One study from 2010 found that about one percent of women having a surgical abortion before their 16th week of pregnancy had a complication that could require intravenous fluid, and just one in 300 had a major complication. One limitation, the study team noted, is that not all women checked back after the abortion or had follow up medical records available - so it’s possible more complications could have occurred that weren’t recorded. Planned Parenthood staff members were required to make three attempts to reach any patients who didn’t return for follow up visits under the organization’s medical standards and guidelines. “We assume that if anything had happened, that people would get back in touch with Planned Parenthood,” Trussell told Reuters Health. Two of the study’s authors are Planned Parenthood employees, and Trussell is a member of the National Medical Committee of Planned Parenthood Federation of America. The medication regimen used by Planned Parenthood - and many other abortion providers - is slightly different than the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drug course because it includes lower doses of mifepristone and at-home use of misoprostol. Medical abortions done at Planned Parenthood run for about $300 to $800, according to its website. The researchers said their findings don’t support laws restricting the drugs’ use. “Mandating the FDA-approved regimen, without a scientific basis, does not protect patients from unsafe abortion; it only limits access to safe and effective medical abortion for women desiring a pregnancy termination,” they concluded. SOURCE: Obstetrics and Gynecology, online December 20, 2012. Julie: Yes, that’s a very good idea; Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. Julie: That’s right, and often we’re making telephone calls, we’re seeing people face-to-face with this dramatic information, and it’s extremely threatening and fearful for a lot of people, because they’re not expecting it. David: Let’s move it away from the coronary stuff just for a moment. Do you get people coming out after they’ve spoken to the doctor, and sort of been shattered in the surgery? David: Right. So, it was a very unexpected kind of thing and my initial thought was, well obviously I’ve got to do this, and if they’re going to do it now I’m just as happy to be in the public system as in the private system. In reality, it was a much better place to be in the hospital being monitored in a cardio ward. Julie: I think there is, and I think I’m seeing it more and more that the medical profession in general is full of compassion, and does absorb a particular amount of paint through the patient. David: Now, I think we have to understand that whenever you’re confronted with medical misadventure or serious diagnosis, when the diagnosis is very serious from the point of view of the patient, the questions of, am I going to survive, start to take over. So, the critical question became one day; were they going to have to deal with a potentially burst appendix? They were confident that they could get me through the heart side of things, but there was a potential area of risk there. So I had a fascinating night that night in hospital, and I was particularly glad that one of the parishioners had brought in my little laptop, and I was able to talk about this in a forum post; for me it relieved the stress. Julie: Yeah, David as you are a person who likes to be in control, I wondered how you were coping with the fact that other people took control of your situation and your life. So,\n\n Gardner has said that he is pro-life and that abortion laws should be left up to the states. In 2006, Gardner opposed legislation to allow pharmacists to prescribe emergency contraception and proposed an amendment to the Colorado state budget to prohibit the state Medicaid plan from purchasing Plan B emergency contraception. In 2007, he voted against a bill requiring hospitals to inform survivors of a sexual assault of the availability of emergency contraception. In 2012, Gardner co-sponsored the controversial so-called \"personhood\" legislation titled the Life Begins at Conception Act. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, \"Gardner conceded that with \n\nA new study on major congenital heart disease in Denmark has revealed how prenatal testing is being used to screen out babies with disabilities. The paper, published in JAMA Cardiology, found that the rate of abortion for babies with major congenital heart disease (CHD) increased from 0.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2013 – a 65 fold increase. For prenatally diagnosed major CHD, 57.8% of babies were aborted across the period of the trial. The rate is particularly high for some conditions – in the case of fetuses diagnosed with single ventricle defects (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the most severe form of CHD), roughly 85% of pregnancies ended in abortion. Denmark began offering universal prenatal screening free of charge in 2004, and is already known to have a very high abortion rate for babies with Down’s syndrome. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Back in the first half of the 20th century, they were not pushing women to have abortions, but they were sterilizing people — which is still evil. Today, there is an entire international eugenics complex that is profiting from the advocation and committing of infanticide, and there is a specific targeting of minority children, or unborn children who are not white, to have them slaughtered through the consent of their own mothers, and by the hand of Social-Darwinist doctors. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. The anti-racism crowd is really no different from the ‘Counter-jihad’ movement. Both of them claim to be against a fascist, totalitarian system — with one setting their crosshairs on racism and the other on Islamism –, and both claim to be for freedom, and to be against discrimination. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the jihad. While the pharisees presented themselves as going against Roman occupation, when it came down to the ultimate objective of following their father, the devil, and having Christ crucified, they sided with the Caesar, declaring, “We have no king but Caesar!” The agents of diabolical aspirations will cover up their motivations with seemingly good and righteous causes. But look to the other things that they say and do, and you will see another gospel being preached. They say they are against racism, so as to get you to follow them as they advance racism. Ultimately their pursuit is the wants and desires of the antichrist. from Patient Empowerment Network on Vimeo. Some questions to ponder as a patient: How can I stay informed about new treatments in development for multiple myeloma? She’s the director of the Judy and Bernard Briskin Myeloma Center. She’s a professor of hematology and hematopoietic cell transplantation at the City of Hope. And Kristen Carter is the advanced practice nurse at the University of Arkansas Myeloma Center. I mentioned I was a 23‑year survivor. I facilitate our local Bay Area myeloma support group, and so the questions I’ve seen you already asking today and the questions we’ll be asking our doctors are the same questions that are asked in our support groups as well. What’s the process for approving a new therapy, and should I attend as a patient these medical conventions I hear about like ASH or ASCO, and if not, how do I learn about these new drugs? Yeah, I think people are welcome to attend meetings such as ASCO, but you know there are 30,000 people there and so it’s a fairly overwhelming experience, and it’s very hard to drill down. Any additional thoughts on that, Dr. Richter? Absolutely. There are many of these programs, and if you go to these organizations’ websites there are frequently programs that may be near where patients are. You know, University of Arkansas and City of Hope and Mount Sinai are all extremely advanced in terms of their myeloma knowledge, but there are many others across this country. One thing I’ll add on to what you said about the information provided by organizations like the International Myeloma Foundation, like PEN empowerment network, like the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation is that they have videos and webinars very quickly after ASCO or ASH meetings that will summarize what the major outcomes were at those meetings. What do you find that works regarding being diagnosed with something called myeloma, which you’ve probably never heard of, hearing all of these overwhelming terms of IgG and too high a level of protein, which sounded always good to me, how do you‑‑how should patients be interfacing with both their doctors and their nurses? Well, all my patients have my cell phone number so they tend to call me if they have any questions, but I always tell my patients make sure you write down questions because you know as well as I, when you get in there in front of a doctor who’s got a whole list of patients for the day and they’re seeing you, they’re giving you all this information, and I always call it the deer in the headlight look from the patient because they’re brand new. And we go over this every time and you go, I thought we were doing a really good job of educating. And just make sure there’s an open dialogue. I always tell my patients don’t suffer in silence. If you have a side effect we need to know about it. So I work for Dr. Van Rhee, and we have‑‑we manage, actively manage about 700 myeloma patients from all over the country. We don’t want them to be shortchanged on their time because they’ve travelled all the way from Arkansas, and they’ve done all the workups, and we certainly don’t want them to feel like they didn’t get the time after spending money and travel time to get to our academic center.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. Vasectomy is a highly effective method. Vasectomy is not effective until all sperm are cleared by the reproductive tract. The cumulative probability of failure was 7.4 per 1,000 procedures at 1 year and 11.3 at year 5, and comparable to the failure rate of tubal sterilization (281).The basic technique is to palpate the vas through the scrotum, grasp it with fingers or atraumatic forceps, make a small incision over the vas, and pull a loop of the vas into the incision.A small segment is removed, and then a needle electrode is used to coagulate the lumen of both ends. The CREST study compared the long-term effects of tubal sterilization to vasectomy. The study included 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization and 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy. In terms of effectiveness, the cumulative probability of failure for vasectomy was 7.4 per 1,000 procedures at 1 year and 11.3 at year 5, which is comparable to the failure rate of tubal sterilization. Overall, the CREST study provides evidence that there is no posttubal ligation syndrome and that both tubal sterilization and vasectomy are effective methods of contraception. Modern methods use medication or surgery for abortions. Birth control, such as the pill or intrauterine devices, can be used immediately following abortion. When performed legally and safely on a woman who desires it, induced abortions do not increase the risk of long-term mental or physical problems. In contrast, unsafe abortions (those performed by unskilled individuals, with hazardous equipment, or in unsanitary facilities) cause 47,000 deaths and 5 million hospital admissions each year. The World Health Organization states \n\nNorth America, where abortion is legal and contraceptive use is high, has a lower abortion rate, 21 per 1000 women of reproductive age.The highest rates of unsafe abortion are in Latin America and Africa, where abortion is generally illegal.In the developing countries they are very common.In the developed countries, unsafe abortions are rare.Safety Operative complications include scrotal hematomas, wound infection, and epididymitis, but serious sequelae are rare. There were no reports of deaths from vasectomy in the United States in many years, and the death rate in a large third world series was only 0.5 per 100,000. Studies of vasectomized monkeys showed accelerated atherosclerosis, but several large-scale human studies found no connection between vasectomy and vascular disease (307). Concerns about long-term safety recurred with the report of a possible association between prostate cancer and vasectomy (309). It is extremely likely that normal couples will experience at least one unwanted pregnancy at some time during their reproductive years. As a result, abortion is common. While there was a decline in the overall number of abortions worldwide from 46 million in 1995 to 42 million in 2003, this decline was greater in developed than in developing countries. About half of induced abortions are illegal and considered “unsafe” by the World Health Organization definition: procedures carried out either by an unskilled person or in unsafe conditions or both (313,314). As shown in Table 10.9 total abortion rates are quite similar over much of the world. What differs is the rate of safe abortions compared with unsafe abortions. In the developed countries, unsafe abortions are rare. The highest rates of unsafe abortion are in Latin America and Africa, where abortion is generally illegal.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Context Free birth control correlates to teenage girls having fewer pregnancies and fewer abortions. At the same time, a 2011 study by Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health also found that states with more abortion restrictions have higher rates of maternal death, higher rates of uninsured pregnant women, higher rates of infant and child deaths, higher rates of teen drug and alcohol abuse, and lower rates of cancer screening. According to a 2017 report from the Center for Reproductive Rights and Ibis Reproductive Health, states that tried to pass additional constraints on a women's ability to access legal abortions had fewer policies supporting women's health, maternal health and children's health. According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states with legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. The state passed a law in the 2000s banning abortions before 22 weeks based on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that point in development. Some states, including Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings. The bill was known as House Bill 2324, \"An act prohibiting an abortion of an unborn human individual with a detectable fetal heartbeat.\" One outspoken advocate of such bills is Mark Gietzen, who tried to gather as many signatures as possible in order to get then-Governor Sam Brownback to convene a special session of Congress in order to consider the bill. Kansas lawmakers approved sweeping anti-abortion legislation (HB 2253) on April 6, 2013, that says life begins at fertilization, forbids abortion based on gender and bans Planned Parenthood from providing sex education in schools. The state was one of six that tried to ban abortions in 2013. In April 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and ruled that the right to abortion is inherent within the state's constitution and bill of rights, such that even if Roe v. Wade is overturned and the federal protection of abortion rights is withdrawn, the right would still be allowed within Kansas, barring a change in the state constitution. The Value Them Both Amendment would overturn the 2019 Kansas Supreme Court ruling, stating that \"the constitution of the state of Kansas does not require government funding of abortion and does not create or secure a right to abortion\" (SCR 1613). On February 7, 2020, the proposed amendment failed to reach the need two-thirds majority vote in the Kansas House of Representatives.

According to Megan Donovan, a senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, states with legislation seeking to protect a woman's right to access abortion services have the lowest rates of infant mortality in the United States. The state passed a law in the 2000s banning abortions before 22 weeks based on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that point in development. Some states, including Kansas, have passed laws requiring abortion providers to warn patients of a link between abortion and breast cancer, and to issue other scientifically unsupported warnings. The bill was known as House Bill 2324, \"An act prohibiting an abortion of an unborn human individual with a detectable fetal heartbeat.\" One outspoken advocate of such bills is Mark Gietzen, who tried to gather as many signatures as possible in order to get then-Governor Sam Brownback to convene a special session of Congress in order to consider the bill. Kansas lawmakers approved sweeping anti-abortion legislation (HB 2253) on April 6, 2013, that says life begins at fertilization, forbids abortion based on gender and bans Planned Parenthood from providing sex education in schools. The state was one of six that tried to ban abortions in 2013. In April 2019, the Kansas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court's decision, and ruled that the right to abortion is inherent within the state's constitution and bill of rights, such that even if Roe v.

When he had open heart surgery in 2007, his surgeon noticed some damage to the bones in his chest caused by the radiation. \"For safety's sake, they decided they did not want to risk another open heart procedure,\" Leigeb said. \"The doctors told me the surgeon had done a great job putting me together before, but they did not want to take a chance on me.\" Because the procedure is minimally invasive, patients usually heal more quickly. On the other hand, TAVR is not appropriate for every patient. It is a more complex surgery, carries its own set of risks and requires the involvement of a multidisciplinary team of specialists representing the areas of interventional cardiology, advanced cardiac imaging and cardiothoracic surgery. On September 6, 2016, Interventional Cardiologist/Structural Heart Disease Specialist Nestor Mercardo, M.D., Ph.D., and Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgeon Robert Jones, M.D., were part of the surgical team that repaired Leigeb's heart. \"Every morning while I was in the hospital, Dr. Mercado and Dr. Jones came in together to see me,\" Leigeb said. \"They checked the incision and my heartbeat, and talked with me. Leigeb was also impressed at how quickly he recovered from the procedure. After the TAVR surgery, he had some soreness and bleeding, but those were quickly controlled and there were few restrictions. \"I could get in and out of bed, I could shower – I could do what I was doing before the surgery,\" he said. Leigeb completed a course of cardiac rehabilitation a few weeks after the surgery and has stayed active. \"For me, there was no downside to this surgery,\" he said. I considered it a plus that I didn't have to have my chest opened up to get it repaired. Throughout the entire process, Leigeb said he was impressed with the excellent staff at the Heart Valve Clinic. \"Dr. Mercado is really nice, and he explained everything very thoroughly,\" he said. \"I felt very confident with him, with Dr. Jones, and with the entire staff. I think I was only the eighth patient to have TAVR in Midland, but I was confident that things would go well. MidMichigan Health offers a full array of heart and vascular services, including open heart surgery, vascular surgery, electrophysiology for heart rhythm problems and advanced interventional procedures. For additional information on MidMichigan's comprehensive cardiovascular team, visit www.midmichigan.org/heart. Most people with heart failure do not need surgery and will be treated with drugs. Heart surgery is only done when doctors think it will improve a problem with the heart valves or the blood supply of the heart, and if the heart is strong enough. In most cases surgery cannot cure heart failure. Another woman who had avoided seeing doctors about her heart for many years was given a new mitral valve and said the operation changed her life. She persuaded her surgeon to operate on her and felt her quality of life improved. She describes how wonderful she felt after her mitral valve was replaced. And just a good job that he was here because I collapsed and got rushed into hospital, spent 7 weeks in there because, you know, having 5 operations is a bit dicey as you can well imagine. And I said to him 'oh dear' and he said, 'You surely don't want me to operate on you?' The last one, the surgeon fitted an artificial, a metal valve, a Starr-Edwards valve it's called. And this was the surgeon who'd had to have time to think about whether he was going to operate? Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG, pronounced \"cabbage\") is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. This new blood vessel is known as a graft (for more on CABG see Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery on our Heart Attack website). It showed that his artery was so bad that it would be dangerous to put a stent in and doctors decided to do a triple bypass instead. One man described how he felt when he was told during his angiogram that he would need bypass surgery immediately. Tests showed he needed bypass surgery. He felt devastated when he was told that he needed bypass surgery one week after his heart attack. But then when you're taken to [the specialist hospital] and you actually see on the screen the effects of what's going on and then somebody says, 'we're requesting surgical intervention immediately,' it is a shock of some magnitude. The nurse then that was on the ward, she was just terrific. Another man wanted to know how many bypass operations the cardiac surgeon had done before he\n\n first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system. He said, \"There is nothing more important to me than your respect, and I apologize to those who were genuinely hurt or offended by the makeup I wore or the \n\nAddressing his television audience on Monday night, Jimmy Kimmel tearfully thanked the doctors and nurses who saved the life of his son, born last week with a congenital heart condition called Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with Pulmonary Atresia (PA). At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. Today, scientists rely on animals, from rodents and rabbits to dogs and pigs, to perform experimental research that result in technological improvements to the equipment—potentially raising its efficacy in detecting heart problems in human patients like Kimmel’s baby. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). This revolutionary development in medical science is lifesaving for infant patients, and it’s also used in the treatment of dogs themselves that are born with congenital heart conditions. Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Like many pediatric cardiologists, Lincoln’s surgeons faced challenges that make their success all the more remarkable: the seven-month-old went into cardiac arrest as they waited for the donor organ needed for his transplant—which necessitated an emergency surgery to compress his heart. This, followed by the transplantation, is especially tough on the tiny body of an infant patient. It’s not easy for family members in the waiting room, either. All over the world, scientists and researchers rely on animal models to discover more about how to detect and treat congenital heart defects—offering infants like Lincoln, and Kimmel’s son, a second chance at life. The innovations in medical devices and surgical techniques that result from this work have enabled healthcare providers to perform magic, one baby’s beating heart at a time.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Nevertheless, in a certain percentage of case there is an unexplainable persistence of pain in presence of a well-performed surgery. Radiofrequencies are used for the treatment of chronic nervous pain and also in some cases of osteoarthritis. Costs may be an issue, but once the patient has no pain, the rehabilitation is more effective and the surgery con is postponed or deleted. The most common location for residual pain after TKA is anteriorly, because residual pain has been associated with patellofemoral disorders. Other possible causes of residual pain include: low-grade infection, instability, aseptic loosening, and hypersensitivity to metal or cement, complex regional pain syndrome, pseudo aneurysm . Identify the etiology of the residual pain can be a difficult diagnostic challenge and up to 10% to 15 % of patients may have unexplained pain. The nature of PPSP remains unclear, but iatrogenic neuropathic pain caused by incision and nerve injury is thought to be the most common cause of PPSP . If after performing an appropriate diagnostic algorithm, etiology of PPSP cannot be identified, patients should have an intensive trial of conservative therapy for at least 3 months including pain control with painkillers and physical therapy. Since PPSP in difficult to treat with surgery because the cause to treat is unknown, these patients are usually referred to the rehabilitation or to the therapy f chronic pain. The possibility to reduce or to eliminate the pain with the treatment with radiofrequencies is quite interesting because potentially link the demonstrated efficacy of radiofrequencies with the possibility to avoid a surgery whose effects may be not satisficing for the patients. Since it is believed that PPSP is neuropathic, radiofrequency (RF) applied to the damaged nerve is a possible therapy. Thermal energy production causes tissue heating around the active electrodes . The mechanism by which PRF causes pain relief in the absence of significant heat-induced tissue damage is debatable. One histopathologic study on the effects of PRF delivered at 42°C on the rat sciatic nerve, showed no structural changes aside from transient endoneurial edema and collagen deposition . These histological findings are believed to be a result of the high transmembrane potentials generated with tissues exposed to the electrical fields during PRF application. These findings suggest that PRF treatment adjacent to the nerve thanks to electric field effects can reduce or alleviate neuropathic pain. However the evidences around the c-Fos induction theories are few and lack controlled clinical trials and might have not a role in pain control. It indicates\n\nA new study by Italian researchers investigated whether the use of pulsed radiofrequency can help relieve lower back pain and sciatica. This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. The injections are given directly into the area of the spine affected. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. Some may, therefore, require surgery, with some requiring the disc to be removed. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. This could also help a number of patients avoid surgery, which is often the only other option. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica. The comparative study comparing the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain found that both CRF and PRF were effective in relieving pain associated with trigeminal neuralgia. A study conducted by Alessandro Napoli and his team at Sapienza University in Rome investigated the use of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency (pRF) as a treatment for back pain resulting from lumbar disk herniation. The study included 128 patients who had not responded to conservative treatment for their back pain. These patients underwent CT-guided pRF, which delivers energy pulses to the root of the nerve for 10 minutes. In comparison, another group of 120 participants received CT-guided steroid injections without pRF. The findings of the study revealed that the CT-guided pRF approach had superior outcomes compared to the injection strategy. Patients who received pulsed radiofrequency reported improvements in pain and disability scores. They also experienced quicker relief from leg pain and perceived faster recovery times. Based on these results, the researchers suggest offering pulsed radiofrequency to patients with herniated disks and sciatic nerve compression whose symptoms do not benefit from conservative therapy. This can be an attractive alternative to more invasive treatments, such as surgery or corticosteroid injections. Pulsed radiofrequency treatment is relatively non-invasive, only lasting 10 minutes, and a single session was sufficient for many patients in the study. In summary, the study on CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency as a treatment for back pain from lumbar disk herniation demonstrated favorable outcomes, including improved pain and disability scores, faster leg pain relief, and quicker perceived recovery times. This approach may offer benefits to patients who have not responded to conservative treatments and could potentially help them avoid invasive surgery or corticosteroid injections. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) in the treatment of idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia pain. Nowadays, radiofrequency (RF) is one of the most effective options for treatment. PRF appears to be a relatively safe and effective procedure in the treatment of persistent pain of ITN in a shorter duration compared with CRF. The pain is usually unilateral and associated with a cutaneous trigger zone, and it is severe enough to affect the quality of life. The rapid and correct diagnosis is very important to determine prompt institution of treatment because the symptoms are so severe. For patients in whom medical treatment fails to control pain, microvascular decompression, glycerol rhizolysis, radiofrequency thermocoagulation, and percutaneous trigeminal microdecompression procedures have been used in an attempt to alleviate ITN . When the pharmacological treatment fails, a choice between minimally invasive technique and a surgical approach should be made. By far, one of the most common procedures to treat pain is the use of radiofrequency (RF) lesioning. The main advantages of RF seem to be its effectiveness and high pain relief rate without the dangerous complications of surgical procedures and lack of secondary effects and reduction of oral medication . Lesioning using RF current has been increasingly used in clinical practice for the treatment of pain syndromes. Although formation of heat causing 'thermocoagulation' of the nervous tissues is thought to be responsible for the clinical outcome, a more recent modality of RF application named pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) delivers the RF current without producing destructive levels of heat . RF thermocoagulation has become the most common procedure for treating TN. Microvascular decompression and partial sensory rhizotomy have a lower risk for recurrence but a higher risk for complications requiring hospitalization . The aim of this study was to compare the effects of conventional radiofrequency (CRF) versus PRF in the treatment of ITN pain. All procedures were performed in the operating room. After the stimulation period, the patient was given 1 μg/kg fentanyl and 1–2 mg/kg propofol. Trial stimulation:First, sensory stimulation at 100 Hz was performed with 0.1–0.5 V to search for a tingling sensation at the affected branch, which is the trigeminal nerve branch innervating the trigger zone. We continued to lesion in 5°C increments for 60 s until we reached a maximum of 80°C for 60 s. At each stage, the patient was allowed to recover from the intravenous propofol, and we tested for reduction of response to pinprick stimulation. In the PRF group, a PRF current at a dose of 500 pulses was given to the affected branch, and then we tested the affected area for severity of pain. If the pain was still present, we gave another pulsed dose, and then we examined for pain relief until we covered beyond the trigger area and did not exceed a temperature of 42°C. Patients were evaluated as regards their pain intensity using VAS, patient satisfaction using Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS), the need for additional pharmacological treatment, side effects, complications, and the need for repeating the use of RF treatment. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the presence of complications on the first day, at 1 week, at 1 month, and at 3 months after treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF on the first day, at first week, at first month, and at 3 months after treatment. However, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups as regards the need for medical treatment after application of the two types of RF at 6 months after treatment [Table 3].\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A lawsuit has been filed in California Superior Court on behalf of an Oakland woman who allegedly took Zofran during early pregnancy and gave birth to a child with a severe heart defect. According to court documents, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran (generic: ondansetron) for morning sickness during her first trimester of pregnancy. The complaint alleges the defect was the direct and proximate result of the baby’s exposure to Zofran in the womb. The lawsuit is: Lampkin v. GlaxoSmithKline, et al, case number RG15761042 in the Superior Court for California, County of Alameda. The Lampkin case, which was filed March 6, marks at least the third Zofran lawsuit to be filed against GSK since last month, all of which allege the drug caused serious congenital birth defects. According to the suit, plaintiff Cheri Flynn’s first child was born prematurely in 2004, and subsequently diagnosed with a cardiac septal defect (“hole in the heart”) and significant developmental delays. Plaintiff alleges she took Zofran for morning sickness during both pregnancies. All of the complaints cite much of the same evidence to support their allegations, including studies linking Zofran to heart defects, orofacial clefts and other congenital malformations. Among other things, the lawsuits allege that since 1992, GSK has received over 200 reports of birth defects in babies born to mothers who took Zofran during early pregnancy. Plaintiffs also accuse the company of illegally marketing Zofran to treat morning sickness, when the drug has never been approved for such an indication. September 1 – Lawsuit filed today in the Central District of California by a mother who blames GSK for failing to warn about the risk of birth defects from Zofran. Plaintiff asserts that she has no family history of neural tube defects, and that her daughter’s problems are the result of exposure to Zofran in the womb. September 29 – An Alameda County couple filed a lawsuit today in San Francisco federal court alleging that the mother’s use of Zofran during pregnancy caused their daughter to be born with severe heart damage that required open heart surgery. November 6 – A man and wife from Florida filed suit against GSK today in a federal court in San Francisco alleging that the woman’s use of Zofran for morning sickness during pregnancy caused their son to be born with a bilateral cleft lip and cleft palate. The boy underwent his first medical intervention within weeks of being born and had has first surgery before the age of one year, yet continues to suffer developmental delays and problems with eating, drinking and hearing, according to the complaint. Free Confidential Case Evaluation: Again, if your child or other loved one was born with a birth defect after the mother took Zofran in pregnancy, you should contact our law firm immediately. Zofran (ondansetron) is a prescription anti-emetic medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1991, to relieve nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation treatment, and the drug is currently manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline. Unfortunately, morning sickness is most common during the early stages of pregnancy, and research shows that pregnant women who take Zofran to relieve nausea and vomiting may have an increased risk of giving birth to babies with severe birth defects. A number of recent studies have explored the alleged connections between maternal use of Zofran and devastating birth defects, including one notable study published in the journal Reproductive Toxicology in December 2014, which found double the risk of “hole in the heart” birth defects in babies exposed to Zofran during the first trimester of pregnancy, and a 62% increased risk of birth defects overall. In 2011, a large study conducted by the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Slone Epidemiology Center in Massachusetts, reported a two-times increased risk of cleft palate birth defects among children exposed to Zofran during the early stages of pregnancy, when a developing fetus is most susceptible to harm. In August 2012, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint against GSK for allegedly marketing Zofran as an off-label treatment for pregnant women, which is illegal, and the drug maker was ordered to pay $3 billion to resolve the claims. No intervention was made by Purdue to contact the DEA for years despite knowing of the practice and the overuse and sale of their product. L-456712), and names Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. and Merck & Co., Inc. as defendants. The complaint states that the woman began treatment with Fosamax in December 2005 and suffered a right subtrochanteric femur fracture in July 2010. Merck won approval for Fosamax in 1995; the drug is intended to treat bone loss due to osteoporosis and osteopenia. The lawsuit also claims that the Merck knew, or should have known, about this defect, yet continued to market Fosamax without warning consumers. Meanwhile, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that Fosamax and other bisphosphonates, such as Actonel or Boniva, may increase risks for atypical femur fractures in patients taking the medication to treat osteoporosis. The FDA has also recently published research about the risks and benefits of bisphosphonate therapy. The data was published in the New England Journal of Medicine this May. In fact, the national law firm recently filed several other, similar, lawsuits on behalf of women who took Fosamax and subsequently suffered fractures. We also recently wrote that another lawsuit, also filed by Parker Waichman LLP, in which a Maryland woman claimed that Merck’s Fosamax caused her double thigh fractures. Another recent study of adverse event reports involving Fosamax and other bisphosphonates found that the risk of esophageal cancer associated with these drugs might be higher than first thought. Last summer, the FDA issued a Drug Safety Communication to update the public on its ongoing review of the possible association between oral bisphosphonate drugs and an increased risk of esophageal cancer. At that time, the agency noted that the two studies it reviewed had reached conflicting conclusions and, while the FDA said it believed the benefits of bisphosphonates continued to outweigh their risks, it acknowledged that further study of the issue was needed. How does Zofran cause birth defects? The FDA instructed GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to perform a study determining Zofran’s effects on heart activity. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Apr 22, 2015 | Comments Off on Are you currently pregnant and taking Zofran? A mother’s worry tends to set in as soon as the pregnancy test comes back positive. A teratogen is an agent such as drugs, medications, infections, or chemicals causing birth defects or harm to a fetus. Zofran, an antiemetic medication, is potentially linked to birth defects including cleft lip, cleft palate, and congenital heart defect (CHD). It’s important to have a discussion with your healthcare professional about how best to manage your symptoms and finding a safe treatment for you and your baby. If you took Zofran during your first trimester of pregnancy, and have a child with birth defects, contact us for a free case consultation. The complaint is filed on behalf of a little boy who was born with Supraventricular Tachycardia,or SVT, a serious heart birth defect. In the lawsuit, Mr. Kershaw and Mr. Talley allege the child’s birth defect was suffered after his mother took Zofran, also known as Ondansetron, during her first trimester of pregnancy. According to the filing, the baby’s mother was prescribed Zofran, off-label, to alleviate morning sickness she experienced in the early weeks of her pregnancy. The complaint alleges the little boy’s SVT was the direct result of exposure to Zofran in utero. A frequently asked question from potential clients is, “Do I have a Zofran case?” As you may know, Zofran is linked to various birth defects. Typically, in these cases, the mother took Zofran during her first trimester of pregnancy and her child is born with a birth defect(s). The other factor to take into consideration is the type of birth defect. Right now, there is limited research and scientific data connecting Zofran use during pregnancy with birth defects. What is the statute of limitations on Zofran cases? So, if you just discovered the link between Zofran and birth defects, the statute would start to run from the date of that discovery. If a defendant is intentionally concealing a link between a drug and a birth defect, that concealment or fraud can “toll” the statute of limitations. So, if you took Zofran and have a child with a birth defect, it’s very important to call an attorney immediately. | Posted By: Natalie | Posted on: Mar 24, 2015 | Comments Off on How does Zofran cause birth defects? Birth defects may be caused by drug exposure during early pregnancy. This was first evidenced by the thalidomide tragedy during the post-war era of the 1960’s. Thalidomide was a sleeping pill and tranquilizer marketed as safe for use in pregnant women. Unfortunately, it was anything but safe for the fetus. Severe birth defects secondary to Thalidomide prompted the start of the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) drug approval and monitoring systems. According to The Thalidomide Tragedy: Lessons for Drug Safety and Regulation, “They advertised their product as “completely safe” for everyone, including mother and child, “even during pregnancy,” as its developers “could not find a dose high enough to kill a rat.” This is analogous with GlaxoSmithKline and their advertising of Zofran as safe during pregnancy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus Detection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Samples can be obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material), throat swabs, deep airway material collected via suction catheter or saliva. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Collecting saliva may be as effective as nasal and throat swabs, although this is not certain. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Other molecular tests Isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests also amplify the virus's genome. They are faster than PCR because they don't involve repeated heating and cooling cycles. In the case of a coronavirus, these are usually proteins from the surface spikes. Antigen tests may be one way to scale up testing to much greater levels. RT-PCR tests are accurate but require too much time, energy and trained personnel to run the tests. \"There will never be the ability on a [PCR] test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Deborah Birx, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said on 17 April 2020. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\" Samples may be collected via nasopharyngeal swab, a swab of the anterior nares, or from saliva (obtained by various methods including lollipop tests for children). The sample is then exposed to paper strips containing artificial antibodies designed to bind to coronavirus antigens. This is especially true for asymptomatic patients who have little if any nasal discharge. A Cochrane review based on 64 studies investigating the efficacy of 16 different antigen tests determined that they correctly identified COVID-19 infection in an average of 72% of people with symptoms, compared to 58% of people without symptoms. The two main branches detect either the presence of the virus or of antibodies produced in response to infection. Antibody tests (serology immunoassays) instead show whether someone once had the disease. They are less useful for diagnosing current infections because antibodies may not develop for weeks after infection. Individual jurisdictions have adopted varied testing protocols, including whom to test, how often to test, analysis protocols, sample collection and the uses of test results. This variation has likely significantly impacted reported statistics, including case and test numbers, case fatality rates and case demographics. Test analysis is often performed in automated, high-throughput, medical laboratories by medical laboratory scientists. Other techniques include a CT scan, checking for elevated body temperature, checking for low blood oxygen level, and the deployment of detection dogs at airports. Detection of the virus Detection of the virus is usually done either by looking for the virus's inner RNA, or pieces of protein on the outside of the virus. RT-PCR can thereby detect SARS-CoV-2, which contains only RNA. It has become the preferred method. Samples can be obtained by various methods, including a nasopharyngeal swab, sputum (coughed up material), throat swabs, deep airway material collected via suction catheter or saliva. Drosten et al. remarked that for 2003 SARS, \"from a diagnostic point of view, it is important to note that nasal and throat swabs seem less suitable for diagnosis, since these materials contain considerably less viral RNA than sputum, and the virus may escape detection if only these materials are tested.\" Sensitivity of clinical samples by RT-PCR is 63% for nasal swab, 32% for pharyngeal swab, 48% for feces, 72–75% for sputum, and 93–95% for bronchoalveolar lavage. The likelihood of detecting the virus depends on collection method and how much time has passed since infection. Collecting saliva may be as effective as nasal and throat swabs, although this is not certain. Sampling saliva may reduce the risk for health care professionals by eliminating close physical interaction. Quarantined people can collect their own samples. On 4 January 2021, the US FDA issued an alert about the risk of false results, particularly false negative results, with the Curative SARS-Cov-2 Assay real-time RT-PCR test. Viral burden measured in upper respiratory specimens declines after symptom onset. Following recovery, many patients no longer have detectable viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens. Among those who do, RNA concentrations three days following recovery are generally below the range in which replication-competent virus has been reliably isolated. No clear correlation has been described between length of illness and duration of post-recovery shedding of viral RNA in upper respiratory specimens.

Some family and staff members were also reportedly tested for COVID-19. On March 24, 2020, the Philippines had only tested 1,793 people due to the lack of testing kits. Public officials receiving quick results on their tests was perceived to be tantamount to receiving priority treatment as numerous people considered as actual patients under investigation – many of whom were front liners – were dying before their test results were out. In September 2020, with the improvement of testing capabilities and change in algorithm that focused on front liners and people who were in contact with COVID-infected patients, the government reported that over 3 million people had been tested. Federal health officials seek to make screening for the virus a routine part of doctor visits. The new strategy by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specifically urges the testing of all pregnant women, rather than relying upon them to volunteer. The change is intended to ensure that newborns receive highly effective drugs if their mothers are infected, which could dramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission from its current level of about 300 cases per year. More broadly, the guidelines are intended to make HIV testing a routine part of care in doctors' offices and clinics, rather than waiting for patients to specifically request it. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines represent a \"much more aggressive approach toward HIV prevention\" nationally, which he said is \"a long time in coming.\" If mothers refuse, the CDC is asking states to test newborns for the virus so they can receive treatment if they are infected. Since this is now a preventable infection for a deadly disease, we really need to do the maximum we can to prevent transmission.\" Pregnant women are now routinely tested for several diseases, such as syphilis, rubella, Group B Strep and hepatitis, without being specifically asked for consent. Doctors say they can dramatically reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child if a woman takes anti-AIDS drugs during pregnancy and avoids breastfeeding after birth. If the virus is identified in a woman during childbirth or immediately afterward, her baby can be given drugs during the first 24 hours of life, substantially reducing the risk of infection. He said the voluntary system appeared to be working, adding that he would not want to discourage women from obtaining prenatal care. Still, he added, \"I would encourage anybody that might have any risk factor to be tested for HIV.\" Gerberding said this marks a shift because prevention efforts have until now focused largely on changing the behavior of the uninfected. As a result, some critics say, the focus has been more on preserving patient's privacy and discretion than on aggressive public health measures used for all other sexually transmitted and infectious diseases. Some AIDS prevention groups say the push for more testing needs to be tempered by the reality that positive results carry serious implications.

The procedure, which was developed British scientists, is currently banned, but ministers want to change the law to prevent children suffering debilitating conditions like muscular dystrophy. Under the new rules, IVF (In-Vitro Fertilisation) clinics will be able to replace an egg's defective mitochondrial DNA with healthy DNA from a female donor's egg. It is controversial because it would result in babies having DNA from three people – and effectively, two mothers. \"The Government has run a comprehensive and transparent process over the lifetime of this Parliament to review the public acceptability of mitochondrial donation and the ongoing evidence of safety and efficacy of the new techniques involved,” said public health minister Jane Ellison in a written statement. Around one in every 200 babies born in the UK has a severe mitochondrial disease. Although rare, the disorders can be passed to future generations through the maternal line. Chief Medical Officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies said: “Mitochondrial donation will give women who carry severe mitochondrial disease the opportunity to have children without passing on devastating genetic disorders. If the new laws are voted in, it will be up to the fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), to decide whether a treatment can go ahead on a case-by-case basis. Mitochondrial transfer will only be allowed when there is a \"significant risk\" of disability or serious illness. Children born after mitochondrial transfer will not be entitled to discover the identity of the \"third parent\" donor. While many doctors and scientists applaud the move, pointing out that it could eliminate terrible diseases, critics argue \"mitochondrial transfer\" could lead to designer babies. Human trials can then begin immediately. The move was welcomed by scientists and charities. Scientists at Newcastle University, who developed one of the techniques already have a waiting list of women eager to take part in the first trials. Prof Mary Herbert, Professor of Reproductive Biology, Newcastle University said: “We are delighted that the government is taking this forward. “We believe that this technique could open up the possibility of motherhood untainted by the fear of passing on a painful, debilitating condition to their future children. They also have their own DNA, and mutations can cause hearing loss, diabetes, muscle weakness, seizures and heart problems. Their doctors bluntly told them that they should not expect to have a healthy biological child; because of the way mitochondrial mutations occur, each pregnancy would be like playing a game of reproductive roulette, the variable being how severely affected their baby would be. “They gave us a blank stare and very matter-of-factly told us there was really no way we would have another biological child,” says Evan. They were advised to consider adopting or using donor eggs. That’s when they learned about mitochondrial replacement therapy (MRT), a promising innovation in fertility treatments that could allow couples like the Shulmans to have healthy children. It involves replacing just the mutated mitochondria with healthy mitochondrial DNA from a donor, while keeping the biological mother’s and father’s DNA intact. Scientists like Hirano and families like the Shulmans are far more comfortable with that than are policymakers. Where scientists and families see a desperately needed strategy for having a baby, ethicists and lawmakers see sticky questions of how to define parental rights and whether permanently rewriting someone’s genetic code is morally acceptable. But scientists face much stricter rules when it comes to studies involving altering eggs, sperm or embryos, given that those modifications can be passed on to future generations, and ethicists and lawmakers are not ready to accept the social implications of such a scientific leap. In the same way IVF redefined reproduction when it moved fertilization from the womb to the lab in 1978, MRT–and, more broadly, the new era of gene-altered embryos it represents–is pushing the boundaries of human reproduction. Once Noah was diagnosed, Kristelle got genetically tested and learned that 70% to 80% of her mitochondria were mutated, although she does not experience any symptoms. While the cell’s long strand of DNA is wound tightly into its nucleus, a mitochondrion–which is a separate organelle that lives inside the cell–has its own DNA made up of 37 genes. In those cases, technicians can remove a single cell from a days-old embryo and analyze its DNA for the amount of mutations it carries. Dieter Egli, a developmental cell biologist at Columbia and an expert on manipulating the DNA inside eggs, is performing the genetic swaps. He removes the DNA from a donor egg that has healthy mitochondria and replaces it with DNA from the egg nucleus of the woman affected by mitochondrial disease. The resulting egg, containing the affected woman’s DNA and the donor’s nonmutated mitochondria, can be fertilized by the father’s sperm and produce a child who will be more than likely spared from mitochondrial disease. The Shulmans, who are waiting for an egg donor to create their MRT embryos, understand why the idea of creating embryos that are genetically different from combining parents’ egg and sperm causes some people concern. Altering genes in eggs, sperm or embryos can theoretically make it possible for parents-to-be to pick and choose the traits they value and want to see in their children–from physical features like eye color or height, to more complex characteristics like intelligence or athletic ability. But the Shulmans hope that studies like the one in which they are participating will help people better understand how lifesaving such genetic intervention can be, and appreciate what MRT is–and what it isn’t. After the testimony, the committee issued a report supporting research on MRT under the strict condition that it be used to help people like Beverley conceive a healthy child. In 2015 the U.K. became the first, and last year researchers began a study using MRT to help two people affected by the disease have healthy babies. In 2016, Dr. John Zhang, an infertility specialist in New York City, reported the birth of the first-ever baby, a boy, born using MRT, in Mexico, and that was followed by others, including in Ukraine. One concern relates to how precisely the technician can remove just the affected mother’s nuclear DNA from the tiny egg, and how much of her mutated mitochondrial DNA might carry over unintentionally into the donor egg; in a study published in 2017, Zhang said it ranged from undetectable levels to 9% in the baby’s different tissues. Zhang says he plans to follow up periodically with the boy until he reaches age 18 to assess what effect, if any, the donated mitochondria has on his health. Human cloning “Somatic cell nuclear transfer” technology can be used to bring about the birth of replica offspring, and to create embryos for experimentation. But the memory of what happened to Gelsinger has slowed progress in gene therapy for any condition. Approval of the gene therapy paves the way for the development of treatments for more widespread illnesses such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease. Hundreds of inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and many types of blindness are caused by faulty genes. A woman from Seattle claims to have become the first human to have become younger using gene therapy. Elizabeth Parrish, CEO of controversial firm Bioviva, says she has been using her own company's experimental gene therapies to battle ageing - but not everyone is convinced of the results. The self-treatment, which has been ongoing for the past six months, has been met with a mixture of praise for innovation and criticism for a lack of scientific rigour. The research updates came as Raj Puri, MD, PhD, Director, Division of Cellular, and Gene Therapies (DCGT) at CBER told the committee that although his division has only licensed 12 products in its entire history, more than 1,530 active investigational new drugs (INDs), investigational device exemptions (IDEs) and master files are currently under review, and 106 of those INDs deal specifically with natural killer cells, which play a role in the rejection of tumors and virally-infected cells. In April of 2015, Chinese researchers announced to the world that they had used the new genome-editing technology CRISPR/Cas9 on human preimplantation embryos to modify the HBB gene, mutations of which have been implicated in the disease β-thalassemia. The news had sparked a media firestorm and eventually led scientists from across the globe to discuss intently the ethics of such studies, ultimately leading to the decision for an international moratorium on the use of CRISPR with human embryos. Using his knowledge of how genes are organized and repaired in human cells, Dr. Graham Dellaire, Dalhousie Medical School’s Cameron Research Scientist in Cancer Biology, has developed a technique that could make gene therapy more effective and safer to use. Desperately\n\nGene Editing Is Here, and Desperate Patients Want It :: Henry I. Miller , M.D. Should Americans be allowed to edit their DNA to prevent genetic diseases in their children? That question, which once might have sounded like science fiction, is stirring debate as breakthroughs bring the idea closer to reality. Bioethicists and activists, worried about falling down the slippery slope to genetically modified Olympic athletes, are calling for more regulation. Anachronistic restrictions at the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health effectively ban gene-editing research in human embryos that would lead to implantation and births. These prohibitions are inhibiting critical clinical research and should be lifted immediately. Curing genetic diseases has been a goal of biotechnology since the 1970s, when the molecular techniques for modifying DNA were invented. That altered DNA cannot be passed down to the patient's offspring. A string of qualified successes followed, with promising early results for afflictions ranging from fatal genetic diseases to Parkinson's. More controversial is editing the DNA of eggs, sperm and embryos, since those changes would be passed on to future generations. First, of the 58 embryos manipulated with a gene-editing system called Crispr, the MYBPC3 gene was repaired in 42—a rate of success that's unprecedented in this kind of study. Third, all of the cells in the successfully modified embryos contained the normal DNA. If one of the study's corrected embryos had been implanted in a woman's uterus, there's a reasonable chance it would have become a healthy baby. Last month a Chinese group led by Junjiu Huang announced it had used a refinement of the Crispr system on human embryos to correct the mutated gene responsible for a blood disorder called beta-thalassemia. As to the ethics, it would be unacceptable to modify normal embryos—the cliché about \"designer babies\"—but nobody is proposing to do that, and no American regulatory agency would approve it. If the concern is that embryos may be destroyed, parents with genetic diseases are already discarding many while using in vitro fertilization as a way to avoid passing on abnormal DNA. Today's state-of-the-art approach is to create a set of embryos, test them for the faulty gene, implant a normal one, and discard the rest. The use of Crispr gene-editing to correct abnormal embryos would likely result in fewer being destroyed. The potential to help millions of people avoid horrific genetic conditions is nearly within scientists' grasp. What's holding researchers back, at least in America, is outmoded regulations. Today they aren't—and desperate patients deserve access to whatever cures this technology may be able to provide. The public thinks so, too. Popular opinion is in tune with scientific reality.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

HHSA officials said there have been outbreaks of mumps, for which there is no cure, at several colleges and universities in the Midwest and East Coast. \"USD has been working closely with the county to notify individuals who were directly exposed to the mumps cases,\" said Dr. Wilma Wooten, the county's public health officer. Severe complications are rare, but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during first trimester of pregnancy, county health officials said. According to the HHSA, the best way to prevent mumps is by getting the MMR -- measles, mumps and rubella -- vaccine. On March 1, I issued an important email about a confirmed mumps case on campus. The patient, a fully immunized nonresidential undergraduate student has recovered fully and is now back on campus. In light of additional confirmed or suspected cases, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has issued an important message to University of San Diego students. Please read the letter from Dr. Eric McDonald, Medical Director, Epidemiology & Immunizations Services Branch, Public Health Services here. Dr. McDonald recommends that all undergraduate students and residential staff receive an additional dose of MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella) vaccine regardless of prior MMR vaccination history. Graduate students, faculty and staff are at lower risk due to more limited close contact exposure and an additional dose of MMR vaccine is currently not recommended for these groups, although any member of the USD community may receive it. URBANA — A University of Illinois student has a confirmed case of meningococcal meningitis. Dr. Robert Woodward, medical director of McKinley Health Center, and his staff are contacting friends and roommates of the student, who lives on the fourth floor of Leonard Hall, as a means of identifying others who might be at risk. Champaign-Urbana Public Health District Administrator Julie Pryde remembered a particularly serious outbreak in 2008 when two students were affected. “The UI has this under control, and they’re working with the state and local health authorities,” she said. The agents causing meningococcal illness are spread through respiratory droplets and secretions. Most people have natural immunity to the disease and will never fall ill from it, even with close exposure. Most of the public are immunized against the most common type of meningitis among adults. Secondary cases of the disease are not common, but they are preventable by taking appropriate medication. There are a number of effective antibiotics, and medical prevention can be as simple as taking a single dose of antibiotic within the first few days following exposure, the UI said. The Meningitis Foundation of America offers extensive information regarding diagnosis, immunization, recovery and the after effects of meningitis. ***MFA survives entirely by donations. Meningitis Foundation of America, Inc.\n\n M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. This airborne disease is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide, affecting nearly 2 billion people throughout the world currently. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis. They thus become part of the 1.8 billion people worldwide who are currently struggling with this disease. A family member of a student who died at the school in 1934, and who wanted to reinter his remains, filed suit and gained an injunction against the state's moving ahead with the sale before remains could be exhumed and identified. The state responded to the court injunction and authorized more work by a multi-disciplinary team from the University of South Florida, including exhumations. been notified and have been offered prophylactic antibiotics as well. Laboratory testing may be done to confirm the presence of the bacteria, which involves taking a specimen from the back of the patient's throat. The Lehigh University Health and Wellness Center has been seeing cases of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease (HFMD), which is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than five years old. HFMD is caused by viruses that belong to the Enterovirus group. The disease can be spread through direct personal contact, infected air (when an infected person coughs or sneezes), contact with feces (from the unwashed hands of an infected person) and contact with contaminated objects and surfaces. Methods used to prevent the spread of the disease include frequent handwashing with soap regularly disinfecting frequently touched surfaces such as doorknobs, refrigerator handles, keyboards and electronic devices. You can read more about HFMD at https://www.cdc.gov/hand-foot-mouth/index.html. This is why people should always try to maintain good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, so they can minimize their chance of spreading or getting infections. Although there is no vaccine to prevent the disease, or a specific treatment for hand, foot and mouth disease, there are several things that you can do to relieve symptoms. We are writing to let you know that the student who was admitted to a local hospital last week with a suspected case of bacterial meningitis has improved significantly and was discharged from the hospital this evening. We want to stress that bacterial meningitis is a very serious infection. Some types of meningitis may be prevented through vaccination. Currently, two vaccines exist that help protect against a type of bacterial meningitis known as Meningococcal meningitis. Students who are not fully vaccinated can call the Health and Wellness Center or their primary care physician to inquire about obtaining Meningococcal vaccinations. We are writing to update you on yesterday's message regarding a student admitted to a local hospital with a suspected case of bacterial meningitis. At this point, there continues to be no recommendation for administration of prophylactic antibiotics for other individuals. We are writing to let you know that a Lehigh student was admitted to a local hospital late yesterday with a suspected case of bacterial meningitis. The LU Health and Wellness Center is working with infectious disease specialists on this development and, at this point, antibiotic prophylaxis for close contacts has not been recommended. We wanted to make you aware that a student who recently sought care from the Health and Wellness Center has tested positive for Pertussis, which is a highly contagious illness that is spread by infectious droplets. Pertussis is typically treated with common antibiotics. Laboratory testing may be done to confirm the presence of the bacteria, which involves taking a specimen from the back of the patient's throat. Yesterday, we wrote to inform you that a second Lehigh student had sought treatment from the Health and Wellness Center for symptoms consistent with Mumps. We were informed today by the Pennsylvania Department of Health State Laboratory that testing for this student was negative for the Mumps virus.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A 2015 meta-analysis found that the evidence that passive smoking moderately increased the risk of breast cancer had become \"more substantial than a few years ago.\" According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak. The majority of studies on the association between secondhand smoke exposure and sinusitis have found a significant association between the two. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a slightly increased risk of allergic diseases among children and adolescents; the evidence for an association was weaker for adults. The World Health Organization states that passive smoking causes about 600,000 deaths a year, and about 1% of the global burden of disease. As of 2017, passive smoking causes about 900,000 deaths a year, which is about 1/8 of all deaths caused by smoking. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma. In the United States, it is estimated that second-hand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. Exposure to secondhand smoke by age, race, and poverty level in the US. A 1997 meta-analysis found that second-hand smoke exposure increased the risk of heart disease by a quarter, and two 1999 meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. Evidence shows that inhaled sidestream smoke, the main component of second-hand smoke, is about four times more toxic than mainstream smoke. This fact has been known to the tobacco industry since the 1980s, though it kept its findings secret. Some scientists believe that the risk of passive smoking, in particular the risk of developing coronary heart diseases, may have been substantially underestimated. In 1997, a meta-analysis on the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and lung cancer concluded that such exposure caused lung cancer. reanalyzed the data from this meta-analysis to account for publication bias and estimated that the relative risk of lung cancer among those exposed to secondhand smoke was 1.19, slightly lower than the original estimate. A 2000 meta-analysis found a relative risk of 1.48 for lung cancer among men exposed to secondhand smoke, and a relative risk of 1.16 among those exposed to it at work. A 2014 meta-analysis noted that \"the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk is well established.\" One proposed explanation is that second-hand smoke is not simply a diluted version of \"mainstream\" smoke, but has a different composition with more toxic substances per gram of total particulate matter. These meta-analyses show that there is a statistically significant and consistent association\n\nThe implementation of comprehensive smoking bans has been associated with several health benefits. These bans have been shown to reduce the rates of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction (heart attacks). For example, studies in Italy and New York State found declines in hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction after the implementation of smoking bans (Barone-Adesi et al., 2006; Juster et al., 2007). Smoking bans have also been found to improve respiratory health. Research conducted in Ireland and Scotland found that these bans had positive effects on the respiratory health of bar workers and the general population (Goodman et al., 2007; Mackay et al., 2012). The bans resulted in improved air quality, reduced exposure to second-hand smoke, and decreased respiratory symptoms. Furthermore, comprehensive smoking bans have had beneficial effects on the health of children. Studies have shown that smoke-free home and workplace policies significantly reduce children's exposure to second-hand smoke, leading to improved respiratory health (Kabir et al., 2010). Bans on smoking in cars have also been associated with positive respiratory health effects in children (Kabir et al., 2009). Additionally, smoking bans have been linked to improvements in maternal and infant health. Research conducted in Ireland found that the workplace smoking ban was associated with reduced rates of low birth weight and preterm birth (Kabir et al., 2009). Overall, comprehensive smoking bans have demonstrated numerous health benefits including reduced rates of heart attacks, improved respiratory health in both adults and children, and positive effects on maternal and infant health. In the US, smokers and hospitality businesses initially argued that businesses would suffer from no-smoking laws. Surgeon General found that smoking restrictions were unlikely to harm businesses in practice, and that many restaurants and bars might see increased business. In 2003, New York City amended its smoke-free law to include virtually all restaurants and bars, including those in private clubs, making it, along with the California smoke-free law, one of the toughest in the United States. The city's Department of Health found in a 2004 study that air pollution levels had decreased sixfold in bars and restaurants after the restrictions went into effect, and that New Yorkers had reported less second-hand smoke in the \n\nAfter the implementation of the Romanian national clean air law, there were several changes in the smoke-free rules in the foster care system. According to the study mentioned, there was an absolute increase in several smoke-free measures after the law was implemented. These measures included bans on non-cigarette tobacco products, non-smoking on premises for both adults and children, and no smoking in cars to transport children. Specifically, there was a 10.6% increase in bans on non-cigarette tobacco products, an 18.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for adults, a 10.3% increase in non-smoking on premises for children, and a 9% increase in the prohibition of smoking in cars to transport children. Furthermore, the study found that there was a significant increase in the perception of outdoor bans that prohibit employees from smoking on foster care home premises. However, the perception of indoor smoking bans did not change significantly. Overall, the implementation of the Romanian national clean air law seemed to have a positive impact on strengthening smoke-free rules in the foster care system. However, there is still room for improvement, particularly in ensuring smoke-free environments in cars that are used to transport children in foster care. The Lung Association is now working with state governments to ensure that they implement the rule in a way that maximizes benefits to public health. The most recent success came in March 2014, when the Lung Association helped U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announce cleaner gasoline and improved vehicle technology—the latest step to clean up emissions. The Lung Association helped put long-overdue rules in place to clean up coal-fired power plants, one of the nation's biggest sources of dangerous, widespread air pollution. We took legal action to support EPA's efforts to reduce pollution blown across state lines in a decision upheld by the Supreme Court in 2014. After two decades of persistent effort, we successfully convinced Congress to strengthen the Clean Air Act, requiring cities to enact specific air pollution control measures. Over the past 25 years, Lung Association legal action has resulted in more protective air quality standards as well as holding the federal government to its obligation to clean up pollution sources. Twenty-eight states and the District of Columbia have passed comprehensive laws prohibiting smoking in almost all public places and workplaces, including restaurants and bars, that meet the Lung Association's Smokefree Air Challenge. We won't stop until everyone lives and works in a smokefree city or state. In 2009, the Lung Association played a key role in passing the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, which gives the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority over the marketing, sale and manufacturing of tobacco products. The measure covered 99 percent of all flights in the U.S. Over the next decade, many airlines made all their flights smokefree.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina. As of , a total of people were confirmed to have been infected, and people were known to have died because of the virus. On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise. The number of tests increased over time, although there were some concerns as there was less testing than in other countries of the region such as Chile and Peru. Background On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality rate for COVID-19 has been much lower than the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, but transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Timeline February 2020 After the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan after 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. March 2020 A first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Buenos Aires on 3 March, in a 43-year-old man who had arrived two days earlier from Milan, Italy. The Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first death from coronavirus in the country on 7 March, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris who also had other health conditions. On 11 March, the government also announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries including China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. The first cases from local transmission were confirmed on the next day in Buenos Aires and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Chaco, and Córdoba. In Chaco, the first native transmission was also confirmed. The first patient with the virus in the country was discharged and left hospital in Buenos Aires the next day. On 23 March, Ministry of Health officials reported the virus was spreading via \"community transmission\" in the City of Buenos Aires, its surroundings and some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and Córdoba provinces. April finally concluded with 4,415 confirmed cases, 218 deaths and 1,245 recoveries. May ended with 16,838 confirmed cases, 539 deaths and 5,323 recoveries. On 9 June, the government of the Formosa Province reported the first case of COVID-19 in its province, leaving the Catamarca Province as the only province that did not report any cases at the time. Martín Insaurralde, the Mayor of Lomas de Zamora was diagnosed with COVID-19 and isolated on 12 June. A few days later, it was informed that June concluded with 64,517 confirmed cases, 1,307 deaths and 22,015 recoveries from the virus. On 3 July, The Governor of the Catamarca Province confirmed its first case within the province. Catamarca was the last province to report its first case since the virus reached the country on 3 March. Two weeks later, on 31 July, in another press conference, Fernández announced that the lockdown restrictions at that moment would continue until 16 August as there were a record of cases and deaths in the past days due to the virus. July concluded with 191,289 confirmed cases, 3,543 deaths and 83,767 recoveries. This led to a recovery rate of 70% of confirmed COVID-19 cases through the date.

On 3 July, The Governor of the Catamarca Province confirmed its first case within the province. Catamarca was the last province to report its first case since the virus reached the country on 3 March. Two weeks later, on 31 July, in another press conference, Fernández announced that the lockdown restrictions at that moment would continue until 16 August as there were a record of cases and deaths in the past days due to the virus. July concluded with 191,289 confirmed cases, 3,543 deaths and 83,767 recoveries. This led to a recovery rate of 70% of confirmed COVID-19 cases through the date. August finally concluded with 417,722 confirmed cases, 8,660 deaths and 301,182 recoveries. That same day, the province confirmed the first cases of the Brazilian and South African variants in Toronto. ; New Zealand has reported 5 new cases, bringing the total number to 2,320 (1,964 confirmed and 356 probable). There are 66 active cases (62 at the border and four community transmissions). ; Singapore has reported 24 new cases including one in community and 24 imported, bringing the total to 59,699. ; New Zealand has reported one new case in managed isolation, bringing the total number to 1,974 (1,618 confirmed and 356 probable). Later that day, a new community transmission (a managed isolation worker) was reported in Auckland. ; Singapore has reported four new cases of which all of them are imported, bringing the total to 58,047. The COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina is part of the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). On 3 March 2020, the virus was confirmed to have spread to Argentina. As of , a total of people were confirmed to have been infected, and people were known to have died because of the virus. On 7 March 2020, the Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first documented death, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris, France, who also had other health conditions; the case was only confirmed as positive after the patient's demise. The number of tests increased over time, although there were some concerns as there was less testing than in other countries of the region such as Chile and Peru. Background On 12 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, who was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality rate for COVID-19 has been much lower than the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, but transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. Timeline February 2020 After the cruise ship Diamond Princess was quarantined in the Port of Yokohama in Japan after 10 passengers were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, among the passengers diagnosed positive was the first Argentine infected, a 61-year-old man travelling with his wife, who had no symptoms. The patient was later transferred to a hospital in Japan. March 2020 A first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in Buenos Aires on 3 March, in a 43-year-old man who had arrived two days earlier from Milan, Italy. The Ministry of Health confirmed the country's first death from coronavirus in the country on 7 March, a 64-year-old man who had travelled to Paris who also had other health conditions. On 11 March, the government also announced a mandatory 14-day-quarantine to every person that returned to Argentina from highly affected countries including China, South Korea, Japan, Iran, the United States and all of Europe. The first cases from local transmission were confirmed on the next day in Buenos Aires and the provinces of Buenos Aires, Chaco, and Córdoba. In Chaco, the first native transmission was also confirmed. The first patient with the virus in the country was discharged and left hospital in Buenos Aires the next day. On 23 March, Ministry of Health officials reported the virus was spreading via \"community transmission\" in the City of Buenos Aires, its surroundings and some cities in Chaco, Tierra del Fuego and Córdoba provinces. April finally concluded with 4,415 confirmed cases, 218 deaths and 1,245 recoveries. May ended with 16,838 confirmed cases, 539 deaths and 5,323 recoveries. On 9 June, the government of the Formosa Province reported the first case of COVID-19 in its province, leaving the Catamarca Province as the only province that did not report any cases at the time. Martín Insaurralde, the Mayor of Lomas de Zamora was diagnosed with COVID-19 and isolated on 12 June.

Risk factors Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP. They are: Prematurity High exposure to oxygen Low birth weight Various types of infections Cardiac defects Anaemia Low vitamin E level Pathophysiology During development, blood vessels grow from the central part of the retina outwards. This process is completed a few weeks before the normal time of delivery. However, in premature babies it is incomplete. If the vessels grow and branch abnormally the baby develops ROP. If excess oxygen is given, normal blood vessels degrade and cease to develop. When the excess oxygen environment is removed, the blood vessels rapidly begin forming again and grow into the vitreous humor of the eye from the retina. The key disease element in ROP is fibrovascular proliferation. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Multiple factors can determine whether the disease progresses, including overall health, birth weight, the stage of ROP at initial diagnosis, and the presence or absence of \"plus disease\". Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use reduces the rate of ROP, but may raise the risk of other hypoxia-related systemic complications, including death. This classification was used for the major clinical trials. The circumferential extent of the disease is described in segments as if the top of the eye were 12 on the face of an analog clock, e.g. (The extent is a bit less important since the treatment indications from the Early Treatment for ROP.) Stage 3 is extraretinal fibrovascular tissue. Stage 5 is total retinal detachment. This reflects the increase of blood flow through the retina. Any premature baby with severe illness in perinatal period (Respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, blood transfusion, Intra ventricular haemorrhage, apnoeic episodes, etc.) may also be offered ROP screening. Examination of the retina of a premature infant is performed to determine how far the retinal blood vessels have grown (the zone), and whether or not the vessels are growing flat along the wall of the eye (the stage). Once the vessels have grown into zoneIII (see below) it is usually safe to discharge the child from further screening for ROP. Monitoring In order to allow timely intervention, a system of monitoring is undertaken for infants at risk of developing ROP. In the USA the consensus statement of experts is informed by data derived by clinical trials and published in Pediatrics 2006. They included infants with birthweights under 1500 grams or under 30 weeks gestation in most cases. Treatment should be administered within a 48 hours, as the condition can progress rapidly.

In a National Eye Institute-supportedmulticenter clinical trial, cryotherapy (freeze treatment) reduced therisk of severe visual loss by one-half in 172 babies with advancedROP. However, the study’s Data and Safety Monitoring Committee,which determined the safety and efficacy of the treatment, believedphysicians who provide care for premature infants should be informedof these findings. ROP, formerly called retrolental fibroplasia, is a potentiallyblinding disorder of very low birth-weight infants. It creates a ring ofscar tissue and slows or stops the growth of these vessels, haltingthe progression of ROP. Study investigators examined 3862 premature infants whose low birth-weight put them at risk for ROP. However, 291 infants developed severe ROP and, after the informed consent of their parents was obtained, were entered into the cryotherapy study. The preliminary results concern 172 of these infants. All the premature infants enrolled in the CRYO-ROP Study were at least 28 days old, weighed less than 2.76 pounds at birth, had no other major eye or systemic abnormalities, and had ROP that had reached a threshold level of severity (“Stage 3 with plus’ disease” according to the International Classification ofRetinopathy of Prematurity) in at least on eye. Infants who had developed the threshold level of disease in only one eye were randomlyassigned to receive cryotherapy in that eye or no eye treatment. Ifthe second eye of the untreated babies developed threshold level ROP,then that eye was treated. For babies with threshold level ROP in botheyes at the time they entered the study, one eye was randomly assignedto cryotherapy, and in the other eye the disease process was monitoredto determine its natural course. Therefore, all infants with two eyeseligible for treatment had the opportunity to receive cryotherapy inone eye. Medical evaluation of all the babies in the CRYO-ROP study will continue and analyses of data on the long-term effects of cryotherapy for ROP will continue to be assessed over the next several years. Bothshort- and long-term evaluations of the treatment will provide valuable information about the natural course of ROP as well as about the visual prognosis of low birth-weight premature infants. An ROP epidemic occurred in the 1940s and early1950s when hospital nurseries began using excessively high levels ofoxygen in incubators to save the lives of premature infants. Theresults of that study influenced the way oxygen has been used in thecare of premature infant to the present day. However, as advances in neonatal care in the 1970s and 1980s enablethe survival of very low birth-weight babies (those under 3.3 pounds),a second ROP epidemic has developed despite superb technology thatregulates oxygen levels carefully. About the same number of infantslose their vision from ROP today as were blinded by the disease at theheight of the epidemic in the 1940s and 1950s. While the causes of ROPare still not fully understood, cryotherapy now offers an opportunityto improve the visual prospects of many premature infants who developROP. Thus, all preterm babies are at risk for ROP, and very low birth-weight is an additional risk factor. Risk factors Various risk factors contribute to the development of ROP.

Currently, it is unclear which approach has better long-term clinical outcomes, greater benefits and less cost. Recent findings There are limited studies in the literature comparing these three different surgical approaches. Principally, the minimally invasive approach allows for a significant reduction in the morbidity associated with the open surgical incision, resulting in decreased use of pain medication, quicker recovery and decreased length of hospital stay. Moreover, the use of rigid laparoscopic instruments results in the loss of haptic (force and touch) feedback and dexterity (40 compared to 70 of freedom with open surgery). In addition, these instruments allow for the transmission of tremors and require counterintuitive movements (due to the fulcrum effect by the trocars), which adds to the technical challenge and complexity of advanced maneuvers such as intracorporeal suturing. Together, these advantages allow the surgeon to perform laparoscopic movements more precisely and easily, compared to CLS. Despite the benefits of being minimally invasive, laparoscopy pyeloplasty failed to be adopted widely due to technical challenges, specifically with the intracorporeal suturing . In addition, there are a limited number of studies that provide a direct comparison between the various surgical approaches for the treatment of UPJO, the majority being retrospective. In comparison to open dismembered pyeloplasty, RALP is typically associated with longer operative times due to the need for setting up and docking the robotic system. However, subsequent studies indicated that with the creation of a collaborative protocol between surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists, the operative times associated with RALP could be significantly reduced, nearing to that of open dismembered pyeloplasty [4▪▪,8]. Moreover, RALP is associated with higher parental satisfaction regarding overall life, impact of the surgery on patient life, burden of postoperative follow-up and size of incision scar when compared to open dismembered pyeloplasty . In comparison to laparoscopy pyeloplasty, RALP was associated with similar overall operative times with comparable results . As laparoscopy pyeloplasty is not associated with the high equipment cost as with RALP, it may be concluded that laparoscopy pyeloplasty is always preferable over RALP. However, it has been observed that the ureteropelvic anastomosis is easier to perform with RALP, closely emulating the movement and techniques used during open surgery . As additional laparoscopic skills are not needed, the learning curve for RALP may be markedly abbreviated requiring little previous robotic or laparoscopic experience [11▪]. Less invasive approaches have been developed to minimize the morbidity associated with ureteral reimplantation. With robotic assistance, the laparoscopic approach has become more feasible resulting from the improved visualization and the increased maneuverability of the instruments [1,15]. Like OUR, robotic assisted laparoscopic ureteral reimplant (RALUR) can be performed either through an intravesical or extravesical approach. However, RALUR required longer operative times compared to OUR. Compared to the extravesical approach, intravesical RALUR is technically more challenging, associated with difficulties in maintaining pneumovesicum (either through leakage around the trocars or retroperitoneally following ureter dissection) and the inability to perform the procedure in young children due to the small bladder size (<130 ml) . However, this challenge may be overcome with the introduction of the Surgiquest apparatus, which maintains pneumoperitoneum by increasing flow when sensing CO2 leaks. The robotic approach with its three-dimensional visualization appeared to minimize the risk of voiding dysfunction by allowing more careful dissection and avoiding nerve injury . [17▪] reported on 20 patients who underwent extravesical RALUR and performed a case–control comparison with 17 patients who underwent extravesical OUR. The authors observed that the robotic group had a similar incidence of significant pain,\n\n can also still use telemanipulators for their input. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery. Memory devices play an essential role in preventing any inconveniences in the robot-assisted surgery. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear. Articles in the newly created Journal of Robotic Surgery tend to report on one surgeon's experience. Complications related to robotic surgeries range from converting the surgery to open, re-operation, permanent injury, damage to viscera and nerve damage. From 2000 to 2011, out of 75 hysterectomies done with robotic surgery, 34 had permanent injury, and 49 had damage to the viscera. Compared with other minimally invasive surgery approaches, robot-assisted surgery gives the surgeon better control over the surgical instruments and a better view of the surgical site. Naturally occurring hand tremors are filtered out by the robot's computer software. Finally, the surgical robot can continuously be used by rotating surgery teams. \"The robotically assisted procedure was substantially more expensive,\" said the study's lead author, Dr. Jason Wright, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, in New York City. \"This data also raises a lot of questions about surgical innovations and the need to find ways to better study them before they diffuse into practice,\" he added. Robotically assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery, but the surgeon uses a robotic device instead of a laparoscope to do the procedure. Dr. Michael Zinner, chief of surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said there are advantages to robotically assisted surgery in certain situations. \"The wrist on the machine gives you [greater flexibility] unlike a straight laparoscope that's more like a chopstick. If the surgeon has any slight tremor, the machine evens it out,\" he said. \"Nobody talks about using robotic surgery for removing the gallbladder,\" noted Zinner, because it would be more expensive without providing an additional benefit. Robotically assisted hysterectomies were performed 0.5 percent of the time in 2007. At hospitals that introduced robotically assisted hysterectomy, its use quickly rose, the study found. But at hospitals without the robotic option, use of laparoscopic hysterectomy increased during the same time period. Robotically assisted hysterectomy was less likely to lead to a hospital stay of two days or more compared to laparoscopic surgery, but the two procedures were similar in all other measured complications. Where the two procedures differed most significantly was in cost, with $6,679 the median fee for a laparoscopic hysterectomy versus $8,868 for the robotically assisted procedure. \"It seems like at this point in time, insurers are paying the same whether the surgery is robotically assisted or not. If you're considering a robotically assisted procedure, Zinner and Weissman advised talking with your doctor about which procedure will deliver better results. If two procedures are similarly effective, they suggested comparing costs. In the case of hysterectomy, because robotically assisted surgery and laparoscopic surgery have similar results but significantly different costs, Zinner said he'd like to see more surgeons training in the laparoscopic procedure.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The gel, which is made from ordinary brown seaweed, is injected into the heart using a catheter fed through a vein in the groin. They are also thought to be helpful with premenstrual syndrome and other female problems. The Bs are also recommended to reduce homocysteine a substance found in the blood and linked to a number of health problems including heart disease, stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. But the Norwegian study found no clear benefit, even after three years of treatment. Volunteers who took all three supplements faced a considerably higher risk of further heart attacks or strokes. ‘Such therapy may even be harmful and should not be recommended,’ he said. The supplements in both studies were in doses at least double that available over the counter. Although the vitamins in the Canadian study reduced levels of homocysteine, they did not cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In some cases, the supplements seemed to aggravate other health problems, lead researcher Dr Eva Lonn, of McMaster University in Ontario, said. They found that the increased danger was caused not just by chest illnesses but other infections such as cystitis. The risk of stroke was found to be three times higher during the same period. The same applied to urinary tract infections such as cystitis. They found no increased risk associated with the vaccines, confirming their safety record. Unfortunately, recent studies indicate that testosterone can thicken the blood and elevate blood pressure, which substantially increases the risk of blood clots, heart attack, and stroke — especially for older men and those who have heart disease. Bio-T-Gel (testosterone gel) is a product that was approved in February 2012 for the treatment of hypogonadism (low testosterone) in conjunction with a medical condition like undescended testicles, chemotherapy side effects, or brain disorders. These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. Since then, numerous studies have backed up these findings. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. Testosterone in the presence of a slow-growing prostate cancer is assumed to increase its growth rate. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. Nevertheless, physicians are cautioned about the cancer risk associated with testosterone supplementation. It may accelerate pre-existing prostate cancer growth in individuals who have undergone androgen deprivation. Ethnic groups have different rates of prostate cancer. Differences in sex hormones, including testosterone, have been suggested as an explanation for these differences. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. It is used to treat male hypogonadism, gender dysphoria, and certain types of breast cancer. It may also be used to increase athletic ability in the form of doping. It is unclear if the use of testosterone for low levels due to aging is beneficial or harmful. Testosterone can be used as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, injection into a muscle, tablet that is placed in the cheek, or tablet that is taken by mouth. Common side effects of testosterone include acne, swelling, and breast enlargement in men. Serious side effects may include liver toxicity, heart disease, and behavioral changes. Women \n\nUse of Testim gel may have contributed to heart attack, stroke or other serious side effects or resulted in death. Many Testim lawsuits have already been filed against Endo for injuries caused by the testosterone gel. Testosterone regulates growth and the development of male gender characteristics. When applied topically, Testim gel increases bone density, muscle growth and libido, enhances sexual function and increases energy levels. The formulation was designed for use in men aged 18 and older who do not produce enough natural testosterone due to a malfunction of the testes, known as hypogonadism. Unfortunately, many men have been prescribed testosterone gel and replacement therapy for age-related decline of male hormones or “low-T” which has been a popular advertising subject. This use of testosterone is not approved by the FDA and may increase the chance for serious complications. It was approved in 2002 as a 1% testosterone gel formulation to be applied to the skin on a daily basis. The studies showed that men who are treated with hormone supplement therapy may experience heart attack or stroke at a three times greater rate than those who do not take the medications. March 2015, the FDA ordered Testim and other testosterone manufacturers to update product labels with information about an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Other testosterone lawsuits have resulted in awards which ranged from $thousands to $millions. Men or loved ones of those who experienced heart attack, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or clotting disorders after using Testim gel, should have their case evaluated by a legal expert.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Utah has traditionally been safe from Lyme and many other insect-borne diseases, thanks to its long, cold winters — but appears to be changing. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reports of Lyme disease in Utah have been trending upward over the past decade and a half. Most Utahns who contract Lyme disease still get the infection while traveling the East Coast, said Dallin Peterson, an epidemiologist and specialist in insect- and animal-borne diseases for the Utah Department of Health. But, he said, one of the tick species known to carry the bacteria that causes Lyme, the Western black-legged tick, has migrated to Utah. Traditionally, that species has mostly inhabited Washington, Oregon and California, Peterson said, but recently it appears to be moving east into Idaho and Utah. Climate change is likely helping to spread disease-carrying insects into the state, which has been relatively free of insect-borne diseases. In temperate states, cold winter weather should kill large numbers of young ticks each year. The number of Western black-legged ticks in Utah is thought to still be too low to cause a Lyme disease outbreak, but officials are developing a statewide surveillance system to monitor the pest’s migration. Lyme isn’t the only disease of concern, Peterson said. Utahns regularly report cases of tick-borne diseases, including Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Mosquito-borne illnesses remain Peterson’s primary concern. The disease has turned up in Southern California and Nevada and may be headed toward Utah, Peterson said. Changing climate and its effects on habitats also have introduced new species of wildlife to some areas, LeFevre said, which has encouraged the spread of the ticks. Taken together, these factors increase the likelihood that Lyme-carrying ticks will encounter humans unfamiliar with their risk — a major concern, warns Jay Lemery, who oversees the wilderness and environmental section at the University of Colorado’s School of Medicine. Lemery advised Utahns to learn to check themselves thoroughly for ticks when they have been in wooded or grassy areas, because tick bites are less likely to transmit diseases if the tick is removed quickly. Lemery said Utahns should be aware that ticks may be much smaller than they anticipate and will hide in skin folds or crevices. Peterson urged Utahns headed outdoors to wear protective clothing and insect repellent, which will deter both mosquitoes and ticks. Utahns should see their physician if they develop flulike symptoms, a fever or a rash after recreating outdoors. Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Ticks tend to be more active during warmer months, though this varies by geographic region and climate. With summer approaching and more people hiking or simply enjoying the Southern California sunshine, concerns about blood-sucking ticks spreading Lyme disease are real. The western blacklegged tick is the most common variety found in California. However, while the disease infiltrated California nearly 30 years ago, the number of cases are way below those reported in the Northeast and Midwest. Vector-borne disease experts say Lyme disease is simply not a serious problem in Southern California. Still, that doesn’t mean Lyme disease never will be a problem. First, the western blacklegged tick has been found in dozens of places in Southern California, albeit not in great numbers and usually not carrying the bacteria that causes Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. For example, from 1985 to 2013, the CDH collected 15,236 ticks in Los Angeles County, 5,973 in Riverside County, 917 in San Bernardino County and 866 in Orange County. On average, 20-30 cases are reported to L.A. County health every year but only a handful are confirmed as Lyme disease. Confirmed cases vary from 0 to 8 per year and many of those are from people who visited places outside of Southern California. Only about 1 percent of the ticks are infected with B. burgdorferi. And new studies say global climate change may be increasing the range of disease-carrying ticks and the amount of time they are active. Both Riverside County and the Greater Los Angeles Vector Control District do not look for ticks. “We actually discontinued routine tick collections/testing a few years ago to focus our resources on mosquito control and West Nile virus surveillance which is a much higher priority here in Southern California,” wrote Keith Jones, deputy director of the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health in an emailed response. “We always wrestle with that question: What risk do we have for Lyme disease for people who go hiking,” said Kelly Middleton, spokesperson for the Greater LA district. Orange County has a very low prevalence for Lyme disease. So the tick no longer has the ability to spread the disease, she said. Ixodes pacificus, or the western blacklegged tick, has been found in 56 of 58 California counties. In some parts of the state, more people are infected by nymphs than adult ticks.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Measles, a highly contagious respiratory disease which in some cases can lead to hearing loss, pneumonia and death, is relatively rare in the United States due to high vaccination rates. One of the 2011 outbreaks also was in Indiana. Dr. Jorge Parada, professor of medicine and direction of the infection prevention and control program at Loyola University Medical Center near Chicago, said the reason for the increased cases of measles in the U.S. was reduced rates of vaccination. Transmission had occurred in Indiana this year in unvaccinated individuals or those with unknown vaccinated status, according to Indiana health department spokeswoman Amy Reel. According to the 2010 CDC National Immunization Survey, over 92 percent of Indiana children aged 19-35 months have at least one dose of the MMR or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The Adams County case has been traced to an unvaccinated person travelling to a country where measles is prevalent, according to the state health department. State and county Health Departments were investigating the new case to prevent further transmission. While no longer infectious, officials warn that people who visited the Bluffton Regional Medical Center on February 20 may have been exposed to the disease when the measles sufferer went to the emergency room that evening. No additional cases have been reported as a result of the Super Bowl Village exposure. Three-quarters of all U.S. measles cases last year were transmitted locally, within the United States, rather than being picked up in another country. Two-thirds of people who avoid vaccination cite religious or philosophical reasons, Parada said. Measles is an endemic disease, meaning that it has been continually present in a community, and many people developed resistance. European countries with endemic measles in 2018 were: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Czech Republic, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Background On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine. Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected. By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize. 1-15 March 2020 - imported cases On 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap. He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi. At 4:30p.m., a 65-year-old British woman had tested positive for the virus in Kampong Cham. Arriving to Phnom Penh on 7 March via the cruise, it was reported that a Vietnamese woman, who was seated next to the group on the plane from London, had carried the virus. Two of them refused, claiming that they were healthy and having no symptoms, until the cruise ship reached Kampong Cham on 9 March. The British patient was transferred to Royal Phnom Penh Hospital in Phnom Penh at her own request, adding that she had been conducted with coordination from WHO. On 13 March, health officials confirmed two cases in Phnom Penh at 8p.m. A 49-year-old Canadian and a 33-year-old Belgian were in quarantine in Khmer-Soviet Friendship Hospital.

The virus, which causes Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), is a novel coronavirus that was first identified in a patient from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on June 6, 2012. Sporadic cases, small clusters, and large outbreaks have been reported in 24 countries, with over 2,500 cases of the virus and over 900 deaths, as of 2021. Coronavirus Most infections with human coronaviruses are mild and associated with common colds. The seven coronaviruses known to infect humans are in the alpha and beta genera. Both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome) are betacoronaviruses. Epidemiology In November 2012, Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki sent a virus sample from the first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia to virologist Ron Fouchier, a leading coronavirus researcher at the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. In the article, they noted four respiratory human coronaviruses (HCoV) known to be endemic: 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1. In May 2013, the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses adopted the official designation, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). which was adopted by the World Health Organization to \"provide uniformity and facilitate communication about the disease\" By May 2013, 10 of the 22 people who died and 22 of 44 cases reported were in Saudi Arabia and over 80% were male. By 19 June 2013, MERS had infected at least 60 people with cases reported in Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Tunisia, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK), France and Italy, with a death toll of 38. In May 2014, the WHO said it was monitoring the situation as global cases of MERS appeared to be on the rise, but said the situation did not yet constitute a health emergency. On 3 June 2014, Saudi Arabia revised the country's total cases of MERS to date to 688 cases after re-examining the data as part of an effort to better understand the disease. As of June 2015, there were 1,227 confirmed human cases of MERS, resulting in 449 deaths (37% mortality). Reported cases Africa Tunisia On 20 May 2013, the novel coronavirus reached Tunisia killing one man and infecting two of his relatives. According to a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) publication, in April 2014, Tunisia had a total of 3 cases with 1 fatality. Asia South Korea In May 2015, the first case in South Korea was confirmed in a man who had visited several Middle Eastern countries. As of 16 June 2015, a total of 150 cases had been infected, including 18 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). As of 29 June 2015, 32 people in South Korea had died from this outbreak, with 182 confirmed cases of infection. Malaysia On 16 April 2014, Malaysia reported its first MERS-COV related death. He became ill by 4 April, and sought remedy at a clinic in Johor on 7 April. Indonesia On 11 May 2014, two people in Medan were suspected infected by MERS-Cov (Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome-Corona Virus). Doctors from UAE later contacted the Philippines Department of Health (DOH) confirming the condition of the OFW. The OFW together with four of his family members who fetched him at the airport were quarantined. On 11 February 2015, a 32-year-old Filipino nurse from Saudi Arabia, who was also 1 month pregnant, was the country's first MERS-CoV case, DOH confirmed after the test for the virus turned out to be positive. On 6 March 2015, The Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed that three Filipino female healthcare workers in Saudi Arabia were infected with MERS-CoV. On 6 July 2015, DOH confirmed the second detected case of MERS-CoV in the country. The patient who had contracted the virus was from the Middle East and was referred to the RITM on 4 July 2015. Saudi Arabia The first known case of a previously unknown coronavirus was identified in a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian man with acute pneumonia, who died of kidney failure in Jeddah on June 20, 2012.

Details During the presidency of Barack Obama, who campaigned heavily on accomplishing health care reform, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was enacted in March 2010. In the next administration, President Trump said the healthcare system should work based on free market principles. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform: repeal Obamacare reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals make Health Saving Accounts inheritable require price transparency block-grant Medicaid to the states allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers He also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. The Trump administration made efforts to repeal the ACA and replace it with a different healthcare policy (known as a \"repeal and replace\" approach), but it never succeeded in doing so through Congress. Next, the administration joined a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ACA, and the Supreme Court agreed at the beginning of March 2020 that it would hear the case. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. Major categories of expense include hospital care (32%), physician and clinical services (20%), and prescription drugs (10%). Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. There is ongoing debate whether the current law (ACA/Obamacare) and the Republican alternatives (AHCA and BCRA) do enough to address the cost challenge. In 2009, the U.S. had the highest health care costs relative to the size of the economy (GDP) in the world, with an estimated 50.2 million citizens (approximately 16% of the September 2011 estimated population of 312 million) without insurance coverage. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from a household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. Physicians for a National Health Program, a political advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to healthcare provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems. The United States has the lowest life expectancy overall and the infant mortality rate is the highest and in some cases twice as high when compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. Also highlighted in this report is data that shows that although Americans have one of the lowest percentages of daily smokers, they have the highest mortality rate for heart disease, a significantly higher obesity rate and more amputations due to diabetes. According to a 2000 study of the World Health Organization (WHO), publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on healthcare, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes.

It is often associated with inflammation and has many potential causes, including an acute infection in the mother, exposure to environmental toxins, or chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes. The new test screens for 25 biomarkers of inflammation and immune system activation, as well as for levels of proteins that are important for placenta development. Combined with information on other risk factors, such as the mother’s age and income, the test can predict whether a woman is at risk for preterm birth with more than 80 percent accuracy. In the highest risk pregnancies—preterm births occurring before 32 weeks or in women with preeclampsia, a potentially fatal pregnancy complication marked by high blood pressure in the mother—the test predicted nearly 90 percent of cases. The researchers also wanted to be able to identify risk for preeclampsia, which is not included in current tests for preterm birth. The researchers first tested the samples for more than 60 different immune and growth factors, ultimately narrowing the test down to 25 factors that together could help predict risk for preterm birth. Researchers said the test could help prevent some cases of preterm birth. Based on a woman’s probability of preterm birth derived by the test, she could discuss with her clinician how best to follow-up and try to lower her risk. Some cases of preterm birth, including those caused by preeclampsia, can be prevented or delayed by taking aspirin, but treatment is most helpful if started before 16 weeks. Physicians could also evaluate high-risk women for underlying infections that may have gone undetected but could be treated. For others, close monitoring by their doctor could help flag early signs of labor like cervical shortening that can be staved off with progesterone treatment. A test for preterm birth is currently available, but it is expensive and only screens for spontaneous preterm birth, not for signs that could lead to indicated preterm births or for preeclampsia. What Health Risks Do Preemies Face? Most premature births result from spontaneous preterm labor -- and about half the time, the doctor can&apos;t determine the cause. Even if you do everything right, you may still deliver prematurely. If you&apos;re planning a pregnancy, see your doctor for a preconception checkup. She can identify health risks, such as STDs, that may contribute to preterm labor. If you&apos;ve delivered prematurely before, your doctor can inject you during pregnancy with progesterone, a hormone that might reduce your risk of having another early birth. You should also work toward reaching a healthy weight before becoming pregnant -- overweight or underweight women are more likely to go into early labor. Weight gain within this range significantly cuts risk of premature delivery. She may also perform a vaginal ultrasound to get a better look at your cervix and a vaginal swab to measure levels of fibronectin, a biological glue that helps attach the fetal sac to the uterine lining. If none is detected, you're unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. Fortunately, most women with possible signs of preterm labor go on to deliver at term. If tests show you're in preterm labor, your doctor may treat you with tocolytics, medicines that can postpone delivery. The delay is only a couple of days but gives you time to take a dose of corticosteroids, which speed development of your baby's lungs and reduce the risk of serious newborn complications. ; A novel biomarker for pre-eclampsia, 4-hydroxyglutamate, improves current first-trimester prediction of the preterm disease. ; Maternal serum level of Delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), protein involved in the regulation of maternal metabolic state and fetal growth in mice, differentiates constitutionally small and pathologically small (or fetal growth restricted) human fetuses. ; Fetuses of mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) grow faster already before the \n\nReduce your risk of going into preterm labor. But sometimes delivery occurs sooner than expected. Strive to maintain a healthy lifestyle and attend all prenatal checkups. While the majority of premature births result from unexpected, spontaneous preterm labor (often following premature rupture of the membranes), 20 percent are early inductions due to pregnancy complications such as vaginal bleeding; uterine abnormalities; as well as health problems such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and urinary tract infections. In such cases, early delivery may be the safest route for mother and baby. Because many of these conditions are often symptomless, they are difficult to prevent and diagnose in pregnancy. Taking good care of yourself is the simplest way to reduce your risk of premature delivery. Women who smoke, drink, or use illegal drugs may also have a higher risk of delivering prematurely. Studies show that women have a higher risk if they are pregnant with multiples (twins or triplets), have had a previous preterm birth, or have certain uterine or cervical abnormalities. Unfortunately, there are additional inborn factors that may increase your risk of preterm labor. There are now treatments to help prevent preterm labor in certain high-risk women. Studies indicate that the hormone progesterone, when given in mid pregnancy, can decrease the rate of preterm delivery by 30 percent in women who have had a previous preterm birth. When present in late pregnancy (between 22 and 34 weeks), fibronectin may indicate the possibility of preterm delivery. These diagnostic tests can accurately determine which women with contractions are unlikely to deliver in the next two weeks. The good news is that 80 percent of women who show signs of preterm labor don't deliver prematurely. This extra time can also enable your doctor to make arrangements for you to deliver in a hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit. Though these options can't completely prevent preterm birth, a group of drugs called tocolytics can now delay delivery for two to seven days. Tocolytics have been shown to be most effective when given early in labor. If you are less than 34 weeks pregnant, your doctor may suggest treatment with corticosteroids. These drugs work to speed the maturation of your baby's lungs and can significantly reduce the risk of serious complications and death. Corticosteriods are administered as maternal injections and have proven to be most effective when given at least 24 hours before delivery.

Degenerative and dystrophic diseases of the musculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, osteochondrosis, etc. The vast majority of supplements to support joint, and connective tissue health contain glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), as well as their combinations, which are widely used as supplements in patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders, and their beneficial effects have been documented in multiple clinical trials. Along with glucosamine and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Elgenoflex also contains BioCell Collagen, which is a multifunctional, patented ingredient for joint, and vascular support. It is a collagen type II hydrolysate derived from chicken sternal articular cartilage, which also contains hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate and makes the supplement more effective for patients with osteoarthritis and musculoskeletal disorders. An abnormal immune response against the patient’s own collagen type II (cartilage collagen) is thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis in the knees and hands. After a pioneering study was published in 1993, a number of studies reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In particular, short collagen fragments (as found in collagen hydrolysates such as BioCell Collagen used in Elgenoflex) reduce joint swelling and tenderness, and improve several other criteria used to assess the disease. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), which is also included in Elgenoflex, has been suggested by several clinical trials to have beneficial effects in patients with osteoarthritis, such as a reduction in pain and physical function impairment, and an improvement in performing daily activities, although it does not affect joint stiffness. The most common musculoskeletal disorders are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and fibromyalgia. Most clinical trials that investigated the beneficial effects of these substances involved patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. One of the auto antigens thought to play a role in the development of rheumatoid arthritis is cartilage collagen type II [3,4,5,6]. Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disease. As in the case of rheumatoid arthritis, no cure exists for osteoarthritis, and in severe cases joint replacement may be needed. Degradation of collagen type II is associated with the progression of knee and hand osteoarthritis and with osteoarthritis flares . Accordingly, a recent study of 3,582 osteoarthritis patients concluded that a fragment of collagen type II is the most informative biochemical marker for prediction of this disease. A number of studies have documented the beneficial effects of supplementation with collagen type II hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. After a pioneering study was published in 1993 in Science , a number of studies have reported positive effects of chicken type II collagen and its hydrolysates in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Chondroitin sulfate is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) composed of a chain of alternating sugars (N-acetylgalactosamine and glucuronic acid). Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage, and provides much of its resistance to compression. Along with glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate has become a widely used dietary supplement for treatment of osteoarthritis, although large clinical trials failed to demonstrate any symptomatic benefit of chondroitin. Medical use Chondroitin is used in dietary supplements as an alternative medicine to treat osteoarthritis. A 2015 Cochrane review of clinical trials found that most were of low quality, but that there was some evidence of short-term improvement in pain and few side effects; it does not appear to improve or maintain the health of affected joints. Chondroitin, along with commonly used glucosamine, should not be used to treat people who have symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee as evidence shows that these treatments fail to provide relief for that condition. Chondroitin has shown to be promising in the treatment of Coronary artery disease. When analyzing the data for non-fatal cardiovascular events, the control group experienced non-fatal heart attacks at a rate of 16%, while those in the chondroitin sulfate-treated group came in at 0%. Adverse effects Clinical studies have not identified any significant side effects or overdoses of chondroitin sulfate, which suggest its long-term safety. In 2003 the Task Force of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) committee ranked the level of toxicity of chondroitin sulfate 6 in a 0–100 scale. Pharmacology Mechanisms of action The effect of chondroitin sulfate in people with osteoarthritis is likely the result of a number of reactions including its anti-inflammatory activity, the stimulation of the synthesis of proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid, and the decrease in catabolic activity of chondrocytes, inhibiting the synthesis of proteolytic enzymes, nitric oxide, and other substances that contribute to damage the cartilage matrix and cause death of articular chondrocytes. A recent review summarizes data from relevant reports describing the biochemical basis of the effect of chondroitin sulfate on osteoarthritis articular tissues. Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic studies performed on humans and experimental animals after oral administration of chondroitin sulfate revealed that it can be absorbed orally. Chondroitin sulfate shows first-order kinetics up to single doses of 3,000 mg. Multiple doses of 800 mg in people with osteoarthritis do not alter the kinetics of chondroitin sulfate. The bioavailability of chondroitin sulfate ranges from 15% to 24% of the orally administered dose. reported that chondroitin sulfate is not rapidly absorbed in the gastro-intestinal tract and a high content of labeled chondroitin sulfate is found in the synovial fluid and cartilage. \"Chondroitin sulfate B\" is an old name for dermatan sulfate, and it is no longer classified as a form of chondroitin sulfate. In 2008 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified \"oversulfated chondroitin sulfate\" as a contaminant in heparin originating from China. Clinical trials for osteoarthritis In 2004, a petition was submitted to the FDA that a dietary supplement of chondroitin sulfate be labeled as reducing the risk of osteoarthritis, cartilage deterioration, and osteoarthritis-related joint pain, tenderness, and swelling. Use of chondroitin in routine clinical practice should therefore be discouraged.\" concluded that \"there is compelling evidence that glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate may interfere with progression of OA.\" As of 2015 the largest trial conducted with the product was the Glucosamine and Chondroitin Arthritis Intervention Trial (GAIT), a double-blind, randomized, multicenter clinical trial sponsored by the US National Institutes of Health in 1583 people with knee osteoarthritis, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2006. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of five orally administered treatments: two 250 mg capsules of glucosamine hydrochloride three times daily, two 200 mg capsules of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, two capsules of 250 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride plus 200 mg of chondroitin sulphate three times daily, 200 mg of celecoxib daily, or placebo. It showed no difference from placebo. 2010 evaluated the efficacy and safety of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, alone or in combination, as well as celecoxib and placebo on painful knee osteoarthritis over 2 years as a continuation of the GAIT trial. This was a 24-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, enrolling 662 people with knee osteoarthritis who satisfied radiographic criteria (Kellgren/Lawrence grade 2 or 3 changes and baseline joint space width of at least 2 mm). This subset continued to receive their randomized treatment (glucosamine 500 mg three times daily, chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily, the combination of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, celecoxib 200 mg daily, or placebo) over 24 months. The primary outcome was a 20% reduction in pain over 24 months as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC).

Unlike rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly. The strongest predictor of osteoarthritis is increased age, likely due to the declining ability of chondrocytes to maintain the structural integrity of cartilage.

References\n\nExternal links\n Medline Plus \n\nOrthopedic surgical procedures\nImplants (medicine)\nProsthetics\nKnee treatments\n\nPartial knee replacement offers several advantages over full knee replacement for patients with osteoarthritis in just one part of the knee. Since only the damaged compartment of the knee is replaced in a partial knee replacement, the surgery is less invasive compared to a total knee replacement. Because a partial knee replacement involves a smaller incision and preserves healthy bone and cartilage in the rest of the knee, patients typically experience less pain after the procedure compared to a full knee replacement. Partial knee replacement also tends to involve less blood loss compared to a full knee replacement. Therefore, it is essential to consult with an orthopedic surgeon to determine the most appropriate treatment option based on an individual's specific condition and needs.

Subjects who smoked larger amounts of marijuana, which Pletcher described as smoking one joint per day, did show evidence of reduced pulmonary function, and he stressed that his study results are not intended to encourage people to use marijuana. However, for patients for whom medical marijuana may be a treatment option, the authors write that \"marijuana may have beneficial effects on pain control, appetite, mood, and management of other chronic symptoms. Our findings suggest that occasional use of marijuana for these or other purposes may not be associated with adverse consequences on pulmonary function. It’s important to note that the findings of this study are not meant to encourage marijuana smoking, nor did the study examine other known negative effects of marijuana use, which include problems with memory, concentration and perception. Long term use of marijuana can lead to addiction, and chronic marijuana use is associated with mental health problems including anxiety and depression. Studies have shown that when marijuana use begins at a younger age, it may increase mental health problems, including psychosis, according to NIDA. Heavy marijuana use has been associated with potential effects on the brain's dopamine system. According to a recent study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, heavy marijuana use is linked to decreased dopamine release in the brain. This finding is similar to what is observed in heavy cocaine and heroin use. However, chronic drug use, including heavy marijuana use, can blunt the release of dopamine during the chronic phase of drug dependence. In the study mentioned, researchers used positron emission tomography (PET) scans to measure the release of dopamine in the brains of marijuana users. They found that heavy marijuana users had decreased dopamine release compared to healthy controls. It is important to note that this study was conducted on heavy marijuana users who were heavily dependent on the drug, and the effects of moderate or occasional use were not specifically investigated. Additionally, the study focused on the acute effects of marijuana abstinence in heavy users. Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term effects of heavy marijuana use on the brain's dopamine system and to examine potential differences in effects based on frequency and duration of use. It is also important to consider individual factors such as genetics and other co-occurring conditions that may influence the brain's response to marijuana use. If you have concerns about heavy marijuana use or its potential effects on the brain's dopamine system, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or addiction specialist who can provide personalized guidance and support. In addition, while there are no fatal overdose cases linked to marijuana, there are deaths linked to synthetic cannabinoids each year. Now, a recent study reveals that heavy marijuana use could compromise the dopamine system. Heavy marijuana use is linked with decreased dopamine release in the brain, researchers say. The researchers, who publish their work in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, say that heavy cocaine and heroin use have been shown to decrease dopamine release, but until now, such data regarding cannabis was notably absent. To further investigate whether marijuana dependence is linked with similar effects, the researchers conducted their study in 11 adults aged 21-40 years who were heavily dependent on marijuana, and they matched them with 12 healthy controls. The adults in the marijuana group started using it at around age 16 on average, became dependent by age 20 and had been dependent for around 7 years. Results showed that, compared with the control group, the marijuana users' striatum had lower dopamine release. \"We don't know whether decreased dopamine was a preexisting condition or the result of heavy cannabis use. But the bottom line is that long-term, heavy cannabis use may impair the dopaminergic system, which could have a variety of negative effects on learning and behavior.\" The researchers conclude their study by noting that the lower dopamine release is linked with inattention and negative symptoms in marijuana users, and with \"poorer working memory and probabilistic category learning performance\" in both groups. \"Marijuana use may reduce dopamine in the brain.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Viral STIs include genital herpes, HIV/AIDS, and genital warts. STI diagnostic tests are usually easily available in the developed world, but they are often unavailable in the developing world. Some vaccinations may also decrease the risk of certain infections including hepatitis B and some types of HPV. Comprehensive sex education may also be useful. Most STIs are treatable and curable; of the most common infections, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis are curable, while HIV/AIDS is not curable. In 2015, about 1.1 billion people had STIs other than HIV/AIDS. About 500 million were infected with either syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or trichomoniasis. In the United States, there were 19 million new cases of STIs in 2010. There is often shame and stigma associated with STIs. The term sexually transmitted infection is generally preferred over sexually transmitted disease or venereal disease, as it includes those who do not have symptomatic disease. In some instances a disease can be carried with no symptoms, which leaves a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Depending on the disease, some untreated STIs can lead to infertility, chronic pain or death. The presence of an STI in prepubescent children may indicate sexual abuse.

In recent years, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), also has become a severe problem. Estimates of the incidence of infection differ widely. The life expectancy in Kenya in 2016 was 69.0 for females and 64.7 for males. The leading cause of mortality in Kenya in the year 2016 included diarrhoea diseases 18.5%, HIV/AIDs 15.56%, lower respiratory infections 8.62%, tuberculosis 3.69%, ischemic heart disease 3.99%, road injuries 1.47%, interpersonal violence 1.36%. The leading causes of DALYs in Kenya in 2016 included HIV/AIDs 14.65%, diarrhoea diseases 12.45%, lower back and neck pain 2.05%, skin and subcutaneous diseases 2.47%, depression 1.33%, interpersonal violence 1.32%, road injuries 1.3%.

Both treatments are effective, with a high cure rate in localized disease. The researchers defined medication use as any use of the drugs after surgery or radiation treatment. Results showed that men who reported ever taking statins were 41% to 65% less likely to die during the course of the study than men who didn't. Taking statins or NSAIDs within 12 months after prostate cancer treatment did not extend lives, Katz tells WebMD. \"The study highlights the potential health benefits of statins and NSAIDs in prostate cancer survivors,\" he says. Katz was a member of the team that reported last year that men with prostate cancer who receive high-dose radiation treatment and take statin drugs have a 10% higher chance of being cured of their cancer in the 10 years after diagnosis, compared with those who don't take these medications. While the studies were not designed to examine how statins might protect cancer patients, other research has suggested that statin drugs keep prostate cancer cells from growing in the test tube. As always, a key issue is how benefits and complications of such agents compare with statins—molecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s. To compensate for the decreased cholesterol availability, synthesis of LDL receptors (including hepatic) is increased, resulting in an increased clearance of LDL particles from the extracellular water, including of the blood. ; Ezetimibe reduces intestinal absorption of cholesterol, thus can reduce LDL particle concentrations when combined with statins. ; Niacin (B3), lowers LDL by selectively inhibiting hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2, reducing triglyceride synthesis and VLDL secretion through a receptor HM74 and HM74A or GPR109A. ; Several \n\nBut several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent.Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer?Observational studies in which men who don't have prostate cancer are asked about their use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and then followed to see whether they develop prostate cancer suggest that these drugs might help prevent prostate cancer—but the benefit is likely modest and requires long-term regular use. ## Statin Drugs\n\nStatins are prescription drugs that lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by blocking an enzyme called HMG-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase.

A phase 3 SAMURAI trial of lasmiditan, a serotonin receptor agonist that targets 5-HT1F receptors without vasoconstriction, found the drug was effective and well tolerated for acute migraine among patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The study found that significantly more patients who took lasmiditan (at 100 and 200 mg) were free from headache pain and such symptoms as nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia at two hours after treating a migraine attack. Lasmiditan selectively targets 5-HT1F receptors, including those expressed at the trigeminal pathway, and it has been designed for the acute treatment of migraine without the vasoconstrictor activity associated with some migraine therapies, explained Kraig Kinchen, MD, senior medical director of migraine and related therapeutics at Eli Lilly and Company. Triptans are contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease, Dr. Kinchen said. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was published in Neurology on November 16, just two days after Eli Lilly announced its submission of lasmiditan to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine in adults with or without aura. But they also noted that the drug did have other related side effects, which some patients may not find tolerable. The researchers, led by Bernice Kuca, BA, MS, head of clinical and regulatory operations at CoLucid, tracked 1,856 adult patients with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura who had three to eight migraine attacks per month and moderate disability, as assessed by a Migraine Disability Assessment score greater than or equal to 11. A total of 83.6 percent were women, the mean age of the participants was 42 years, and 82 percent had both migraine and at least one cardiovascular risk factor. In the 11-week study, the team randomized patients to a double-blind dose of oral lasmiditan 200 mg, 100 mg, or placebo, and asked patients to treat their next migraine attack within four hours of onset. Forty-eight hours after dosing, patients recorded their details regarding any headache pain and the presence of nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia. He noted, “If I had a patient [who] was worried about cardiovascular risk, even if they tried triptans or not, they might gravitate towards this product. It also depends on the side effect profile.” For example, he said, patients may say they don't like paresthesia, and chest pain and neck discomfort [side effects of triptans], which might cause them to avoid triptan medications. “They may say, ‘I'll take my risk of 15- to 20-percent of dizziness,’” which is a side effect of lasmiditan. “The patient will choose the kind of drug they prefer based on the side effect profile,” said Dr. Martin. Nasim Maleki, PhD, a migraine researcher and assistant professor of psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study provides a new alternative to a population that would otherwise heighten their risk of cardiovascular events with triptans. “The big positive of this drug, which is very exciting, is that patients who were not able to take triptans because of cardiovascular indications now can go on something that helps,” she told Neurology Today. Kuca B, Silberstein SD, Wietecha L, et al Lasmiditan is an effective acute treatment for migraine: A phase 3 randomized study http://n.neurology.org/content/91/24/e2222. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and numbness. A number of triptans have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity. The lack of affinity for these receptors might result in fewer side effects related to vasoconstriction compared to triptans in susceptible people, such as those with ischemic heart disease, Raynaud's phenomenon or after a myocardial infarction, although a 1998 review has found such side-effects to rarely occur in people taking triptans. People who cannot follow this advice are advised not to take lasmiditan. It should be used with caution if taken in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants. The SPARTAN trial compared placebo with 50, 100, and 200 mg of lasmiditan. SAMURAI compared placebo with 100 and 200 mg doses of lasmiditan. Topline results from the SPARTAN trial showed that the drug induced met its primary and secondary endpoints in the trial. The secondary result showed a statistically significantly greater percentage of subjects were free of their most bothersome symptom (MBS) compared with placebo at two hours following the first dose.

The ergoline antimigraine agent ergotamine also acts on this receptor. Serenics such as batoprazine, eltoprazine, and fluprazine are agonists of the 5-HT1B receptor and other serotonin receptors, and have been found to produce antiaggressive effects in animals, but have not been marketed. Eltoprazine is under development for the treatment of aggression and for other indications. Eli Lilly has filed a new migraine drug, lasmiditan, with the US regulator, the first drug in its class to be reviewed as a treatment for the condition. An oral drug, lasmiditan is a selective serotonin 5-HT1F agonist that Lilly says is distinct from other approved migraine therapies and does not cause constriction of blood vessels. The company said it could represent the first significant innovation for the acute treatment of migraine in more than two decades. The filing for lasmiditan includes data from two phase 3 single-attack studies (SAMURAI and SPARTAN), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of lasmiditan for the acute treatment of migraine. In both studies, at two hours following the first dose of lasmiditan, the percentage of patients who were migraine pain-free was significantly greater compared to placebo. In these studies, patients chose their MBS from sensitivity to light, sensitivity to sound or nausea. Emgality, from the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist class, was approved by the FDA for preventive treatment of migraine in adults in September. There are no approved preventive treatments for episodic cluster headache in the US. Common side effects include sleepiness, dizziness, tiredness, and numbness. A number of triptans have been shown to act on this subtype as well, but only after their affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D has been made responsible for their anti-migraine activity.

In the United States, 90% of allergic responses to foods are caused by eight foods, with cow's milk being the most common. Recognition that a small number of foods are responsible for the majority of food allergies has led to requirements to prominently list these common allergens, including dairy, on food labels. Heating milk proteins can cause them to become denatured, meaning to lose their 3-dimensional configuration, and thus lose allergenicity; for this reason dairy-containing baked goods may be tolerated while fresh milk triggers an allergic reaction. Management is by avoiding eating any dairy foods or foods that contain dairy ingredients. In people with rapid reactions (IgE-mediated milk allergy), the dose capable of provoking an allergic response can be as low as a few milligrams, so recommendations are to avoid dairy strictly. The declaration of the presence of trace amounts of milk or dairy in foods is not mandatory in any country, with the exception of Brazil. Milk allergy affects between 2% and 3% of babies and young children. To reduce risk, recommendations are that babies should be exclusively breastfed for at least four months, preferably six months, before introducing cow's milk. If there is a family history of dairy allergy, then soy infant formula can be considered, but about 10 to 15% of babies allergic to cow's milk will also react to soy. The majority of children outgrow milk allergy, but for about 0.4% the condition persists into adulthood. When these symptoms occur, the allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. Within non-IgE cow's milk allergy, clinicians distinguish among food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), food protein-induced allergic proctocolitis (FPIAP) and food protein-induced enteropathy (FPE). Common trigger foods for all are cow's milk and soy foods (including soy infant formula). Infants reacting to cow's milk may also react to soy formula, and vice versa. Some proteins trigger allergic reactions while others do not. Six major allergenic proteins from cow's milk have been identified: αs1-, αs2-, β-, and κ-casein from casein proteins and α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin from whey proteins. There is some cross-reactivity with soy protein, particularly in non-IgE mediated allergy. Heat can reduce allergenic potential, so dairy ingredients in baked goods may be less likely to trigger a reaction than milk or cheese. For milk allergy, non-IgE-mediated responses are more common than IgE-mediated. Some will display both, so that a child could react to an oral food challenge with respiratory symptoms and hives (skin rash), followed a day or two later with a flare up of atopic dermatitis and gastrointestinal symptoms, including chronic diarrhea, blood in the stools, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, chronic vomiting and colic. Diagnosis Diagnosis of milk allergy is based on the person's history of allergic reactions, skin prick test (SPT), patch test, and measurement of milk protein specific serum IgE. Confirmation is by double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges, conducted by an allergy specialist.

If there is a cow's-milk allergy, occasionally even a breastfed infant may have colic or eczema until milk and dairy foods are eliminated from the mother's diet. Between 2 and 3 out of every 100 children younger than 3 years have allergy symptoms linked to cow's milk. Vomiting after feeding is the most common way a child shows a milk allergy, but more severe reactions can occur. Colic, crying, and gassiness can sometimes be the only manifestation of cow's-milk allergy in very young infants. Other early and more subtle symptoms of milk allergy often involve the itchy, dry rash of eczema (atopic dermatitis; see Chapter ). Of course the most obvious kind of reaction to milk is when the child drinks milk or eats a milk product and immediately develops breathing problems or hives. Most children with cow's-milk allergy are also allergic to milk from goats or sheep, so these are not good substitutes. Soy-based formula may or may not be suitable for milk-allergic infants because some who are sensitive to cow's milk are also unable to tolerate soy protein. If your cow's-milk-allergic baby does not tolerate soy formula, your pediatrician may recommend a special formula made of extensively hydrolyzed protein or an amino acid elemental formula. Many children outgrow milk allergy as their immune systems mature. However, your pediatrician will probably suggest that allergy tests be performed before your child tries milk again.If your child simply has lactose intolerance (see page ), allergy testing is usually unnecessary, and milk and milk products can be gradually reintroduced at home while you watch for symptoms.In supermarkets, there are products with varying reduced content of the sugar lactose that help children with lactose intolerance to be able to have milk in their diet.

It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing tens of millions of birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to \"bird flu\" and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, H5N1 pathogenicity is gradually continuing to rise in endemic areas, but the avian influenza disease situation in farmed birds is being held in check by vaccination, and there is \"no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission\" of the virus. Eleven outbreaks of H5N1 were reported worldwide in June 2008, in five countries (China, Egypt, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam) compared to 65 outbreaks in June 2006, and 55 in June 2007. The global HPAI situation significantly improved in the first half of 2008, but the FAO reports that imperfect disease surveillance systems mean that occurrence of the virus remains underestimated and underreported. As of May 2020, the WHO reported a total of 861 confirmed human cases which resulted in the deaths of 455 people since 2003. In 2003, world-renowned virologist Robert G. Webster published an article titled \"The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population\" in American Scientist. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives. On September 29, 2005, David Nabarro, the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an outbreak of avian influenza could kill anywhere between 5 million and 150 million people. Due to the high lethality and virulence of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, in 2006, the H5N1 virus has been regarded to be the world's largest pandemic threat, and billions of dollars are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. H5N1 may cause more than one influenza pandemic, as it is expected to continue mutating in birds regardless of whether humans develop herd immunity to a future pandemic strain. Influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring may include influenza A virus subtypes other than H5N1. While genetic analysis of the H5N1 virus shows that influenza pandemics from its genetic offspring can easily be far more lethal than the Spanish flu pandemic, planning for a future influenza pandemic is based on what can be done and there is no higher Pandemic Severity Index level than a Category 5 pandemic which, roughly speaking, is any pandemic as bad as the Spanish flu or worse; and for which all intervention measures are to be used. No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu. This means when the H5N1 strain infects humans, it will replicate in the lower respiratory tract, and consequently will cause viral pneumonia. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught avian H5N1. The reported mortality rate of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human is high; WHO data indicate 60% of cases classified as H5N1 resulted in death. However, there is some evidence the actual mortality rate of avian flu could be much lower, as there may be many people with milder symptoms who do not seek treatment and are not counted. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. The clade 2 viruses have been primarily responsible for human H5N1 infections that have occurred during late 2005 and 2006, according to WHO. First, all European, Middle Eastern, and African samples fall into a clade that is distinct from other contemporary Asian\n\nMutations in avian flu could result in rapid spread of new epidemics, with large numbers of deaths. The World Health Organisation has warned repeatedly of the risks to global health from new mutant viruses - of which HIV, SARS virus and Bird Flu virus are just three of many examples we have seen. Just one of these is Bird Flu - caused by virus H5N1. Our world is very open to attack by Bird Flu viruses because we still have no antiviral drugs that are as effective as penicillin and other antibiotics against bacteria. And even if they were, the fact is that 3 billion people live in areas with low health budgets and poorly developed health care systems. It would be impossible to vaccinate the whole world in time, because a Bird Flu pandemic could sweep around the entire globe in a few weeks or months. The cell becomes confused about which virus it is making, and elements of both viruses get muddled up to create a new hybrid. The H5N1 threat to human health. Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected to occur, on average, three to four times each century when new virus subtypes emerge and are readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence of influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the great influenza pandemic of 1918?1919, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957?1958 and 1968?1969. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, such as that seen in H5N1 is characterized by sudden onset, severe illness, and rapid death, with a mortality that can approach 100%. H5N1 is of particular concern and it is widely held that H5N1 will be cause of the next human pandemic. The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1, which began in mid-December 2003 in the Republic of Korea and is now being seen in other Asian countries, is therefore of particular public health concern. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. The current strategy is to minimize the global public health risks that could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds. An immediate priority is to halt further spread of epidemics in poultry populations. This strategy works to reduce opportunities for human exposure to the virus. Hundred million people could die from flu pandemic warns WHO. Bird flu \"far deadlier than SARS\" Hong Kong (Reuters). Expert warns next flu pandemic could destroy Earth's ecosystem. December 7, 2004.\nWHO Presses Governments, Fearing Bird Flu Pandemic. Flu Pandemic Inevitable, Plans Needed Urgently ?WHO. Doctors say bird flu could overwhelm U.S. hospitals. Expert says Canada not ready for pandemic. UK prepares for flu pandemic. Influenza A viruses normally seen in one species sometimes can cross over and cause severe illness in another species. Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) occurred among poultry in 8 countries in Asia (Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Lao, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam ) during late 2003 and early 2004. At that time, more than 100 million birds either died from the disease or were culled. The avian influenza A (H5N1) epizootic outbreak in Asia is not expected to diminish significantly in the short term. If these H5N1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained transmission between humans, there is little preexisting natural immunity to H5N1 in the human population, and an influenza pandemic could result, with high rates of illness, social disruption, economic loss and death. The World Health Organization estimates that an influenza pandemic involving H5N1 will most likely result in billions of people infected and 100 million deaths. No pandemic strain of H5N1 has yet been found. If H5N1 mutates so that it can jump from human to human, while maintaining \n\nWhat Is Bird Flu (Avian Influenza)? The first human case of illness from highly pathogenic avian influenza was identified in 1997. Human infection with avian influenza is rare (the incidence has been that over 700 human infections have occurred with Asian H5N1 virus, according to the World Health Organization [WHO], in mainly 15 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific Islands, and in the near East) but frequently fatal. According to statistics published by the WHO in 2015 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2016, mortality (death) rates from infection with Asian H5N1 have been approximately 60%. Government officials in China announced they detected a new strain of bird flu in March 2013. Pandemic: A pandemic is a global outbreak of disease. The last pandemic involving humans was with an influenza virus, H1N1 (often termed the \"swine flu\"), that occurred in 2009. Epidemic: A fast-spreading, seasonal, or regional outbreak of flu among humans is called an epidemic. Birds have been affected with avian influenza in Asia, Europe, the Near East, and Africa, and the outbreak has killed millions of poultry. However, mutations (changes in the genetic material of the virus) often occur in the virus, and it is possible that some mutations could create a more contagious virus that could cause a worldwide pandemic of bird flu among humans. The virus spreads from bird to bird as infected birds shed flu virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, and droppings. Contact with humans occurs in the same way, mainly by flocks of poultry cultivated by farmers that are exposed to wild birds infected with bird flu. Such a mutation occurred in the so-called \"swine flu\" virus (H1N1) in 2009 that triggered a pandemic. Human-to-human spread of bird flu may occur but has been very rare so far. Thus, it is an \"H5N1\" influenza virus type. This is why a person can get influenza infections year after year. If the new virus is very similar to older viruses, the immune system may still be of some help in reducing the severity of disease. If the new virus spreads easily from person to person, there is a risk of a worldwide pandemic with a very large percentage of people becoming infected and ill from the flu. Another way would be spontaneous changes (mutations) in the bird flu virus itself that would make it more infectious; this results in \"antigenic drift.\" These scenarios are what concerns scientists about the bird flu and are shown below for bird, human, and swine flu RNA genomes; these influenza A viruses all follow the same genetic methods that result in new influenza viral types. If such a dangerous virus acquires the ability to spread easily among\n\nH5N1 is also a concern for becoming a pandemic. Image by the CDC. Scientists are warning the public that ‘unpredictable pandemics’ are possible as viruses spread from animals to humans. The warning comes after a woman was diagnosed with the common strain of bird flu, H6N1 and after an article in The Lancet that talked about a need for “intensive” monitoring of bird flu. Are we monitoring for these potential pandemics? An article published in The Lancet entitled, “Human infection with avian influenza A H6N1 virus: an epidemiological analysis” discusses the human infection of H6N1. No one knows when a pandemic will occur or what virus it may be; however, there has been quite the concern over the avian influenza. Experts are also watching the H7N9 virus as a potential to becoming a pandemic. Image by the CDC. There are 16 different avian flu types, but the one that is of the most concern is H5N1. The first H5N1 cause occurred in 2003 and since then there have been 641 cases and 380 deaths in 15 different countries, reports the World Health Organization (WHO). Other strains like the H7N9 is also becoming a concern. According to the WHO, as of October 25, 2013 there have been a total of 137 cases and 45 deaths.

In one study, Serena Day, M.D., of The Ohio State University in Columbus, and colleagues reported a 436 percent increase in hospital admissions at one medical center between 2012 and 2017 for infective endocarditis related to intravenous drug use. Robert Avram, M.D., of the University of California in San Francisco, and colleagues demonstrated that a smartphone application that measures heart rate using a phone’s camera may help detect vascular changes tied to diabetes. The investigators found that the model correctly identified people suffering from diabetes in more than 72 percent of the cases (sensitivity) using the PPG signal alone. THURSDAY, March 21, 2019 — Only a small proportion of recommendations in major cardiovascular society guidelines are supported by evidence from multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or a single large RCT, according to a study published in the March 19 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. WEDNESDAY, March 20, 2019 — For patients with atrial fibrillation, catheter ablation does not significantly reduce the risk for death, disabling stroke, serious bleeding, or cardiac arrest, but it does improve quality of life versus medical therapy, according to two studies published online March 15 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The research was published to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. The research was published to coincide with the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. MONDAY, March 18, 2019 — Few patients are optimally adherent to statins, although adherence is associated with a reduced risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. THURSDAY, March 7, 2019 — Patients with myocardial infarction at age 40 years or younger have similar long-term all-cause and cardiovascular death rates as patients aged older than 40 years, according to a study presented at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. FRIDAY, March 22, 2019 — Recommendations have been developed for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline was published online March 17 in Circulation to coincide with presentation at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, held from March 16 to 18 in New Orleans. Two years later, only 42 percent were taking these medicines regularly, the study found. The lack of adherence to recommended high-intensity statin therapy is short-sighted, suggested study lead author Dr. Robert Rosenson. \"The message is that the benefits of statins continue to accrue over time,\" said Rosenson, a professor of cardiology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. Rosenson explained that these drugs reduce the future risk of heart attack and stroke and lower patients' risk of dying prematurely. But, for people who've already had a heart attack, the goal of statin therapy is to reduce inflammation throughout the body and blood vessels and improve the stability of plaque to prevent future heart problems, Rosenson said. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association jointly issued new treatment guidelines in 2013 recommending that people 75 and younger with heart disease take high-intensity statins. With high-intensity therapy, doctors prescribe more powerful statin drugs at higher doses than those typically given to patients to lower their \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. He wasn't surprised that heart patients aren't taking these medicines as recommended. \"A lot of doctors were not using quite as high of doses before those recommendations came out,\" he said. In addition, many patients taking statins complain about muscle pain. \"As soon as the patient gets aches and pains, either they or their doctor will reduce the dose or stop the drug,\" Pearle said. What's more, getting patients to comply with long-term medication regimens of all types, including statin therapy, remains a challenge, he added. Once the initial teachable moment of a heart attack \"wears off,\" patients are less inclined to stick with their medication regimen a year later. Rosenson said cost may have played a small role in patients' poor adherence to recommended treatment, although these medicines are now available as generics. The researchers found that the proportion of Medicare patients taking these high-intensity statins increased over the study period. However, even six months after discharge, only 59 percent of people were taking these high-intensity statins as recommended. Certain groups of patients -- blacks, Hispanics and new users of high-intensity statins -- were less likely than others to stick to the regimen. People eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid were most likely to take their statin. Others who were compliant included people with more cardiologist visits after discharge and people who participated in cardiac rehabilitation. The study authors suggested that lower medication costs, greater follow-up by cardiologists and patient participation in cardiac rehabilitation may improve high-intensity statin use. He said that \"well-tolerated, safe use\" of these high-intensity medications plus cardiac rehabilitation after a heart attack \"can save lives.\" The findings were published April 19 in JAMA Cardiology. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. Therefore, it's about 60% likely that you will have some coronary calcification but until the score is determined, the overall predictive significance is nothing more than guesswork. Can the abnormal coronary calcium score be treated? However, a study of 1,005 patients with an abnormal coronary calcium score were treated with aspirin and some with a statin to lower their cholesterol. After four years of treatment, follow-up patients who received a statin had a 7% rate of heart events, such as a heart attack, versus 12% of those which received a placebo. There need to be more studies geared towards determining how the risk can be lowered by specific treatments; however, this study gives a glimpse of the power of finding and treating silent heart disease an early stage. The American College of Cardiology, of which I am a member and Fellow, took a big step forward in 2011 when they commented on coronary calcium CT scans. They released new guidelines for assessment of CV risk in asymptomatic adults. The American College of Cardiology defines Class IIa indications as those for which \"[t]he weight of evidence or opinion is in favor of the procedure or treatment. \"Because the number of US adults with an intermediate FRS and/or diabetes is substantial, these guidelines mean that many persons should have coronary CT calcium scanning.## \"Bulletproof Your Heart\" Summary\n\n  1.Silent dangerous plaque in heart arteries is almost always calcified\n  2.CT scanners can detect and measure this silent killer in seconds\n  3. Guidelines for treating healthy adults with cholesterol lowering statins “evidence based medicine”? The 2001 guidelines were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. As fate would have it, the findings of a major government-sponsored trial, Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT) were completed and published in JAMA in 2002. The only group that derived any significant benefit from more statins were African Americans, who had fewer episodes of heart disease, but no fewer deaths. Presentation of the ALLHAT findings was delayed; the findings were not presented at the November 2002 meeting of the American Heart Association. In 2011, women got somewhat of a reprieve from aggressive statin intervention; it was no longer recommended to prescribe statins for women with less than a 20% risk of developing heart disease within the next 10 years. After a follow-up of one year and nine months, the study was stopped due to the claimed positive results in lowering myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The article claimed the benefit was 20 times greater than the risk of muscle toxicity or diabetes. The data show that the overall risk of death in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease is not significantly reduced by statins. The CTT authors calculate that 91 people need to be treated with a statin for five years in order to prevent one cardiovascular event. The CTT authors relied on data about side-effects from industry clinical trials which have been shown during litigation procedures to understate – or more accurately, to conceal adverse effects. On the other hand, a study that examined population-based health statistics in the U.S. showed that painful muscle symptoms occurred in 53 out of every 1,000 patients treated with statins – 100 times more frequently than had been reported within the clinical trials in the Lancet meta-analysis. “if there is any uncertainty at all about the risks and benefits of statins – and there is – then we have failed to competently implement the most basic principles of evidence based medicine.

Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk. Research shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment. \"But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results\" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. The participants were patients with severe heart disease who were taking high doses of statin drugs, which reduce both cholesterol and CRP. \"What we now have is hard clinical evidence that reducing CRP is at least as important as lowering cholesterol,\" said Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the lead author of one of the studies. But other heart disease researchers cautioned that more work was needed to prove that CRP directly causes heart disease. And most agreed that because the new studies involved only people with severe heart disease, it remained unknown whether healthy people would benefit from reducing their CRP levels. Of people stricken by heart attacks, half have normal cholesterol readings. The second study, by Dr. Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic and his colleagues, asked whether CRP independently predicted heart disease progression. Some heart disease experts said the new studies offered persuasive evidence that doctors should focus on keeping CRP levels low in patients with severe heart disease. \"This is missing-link evidence,\" said Dr. Sidney Smith, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who is a past president of the American Heart Association and co-chairman of a committee of the heart association and the American College of Cardiology that sets treatment guidelines. Others, though, said CRP could instead be a marker for something else being fought by statin drugs to reduce\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Researchers found higher concentration of THC, the molecule which causes its psychoactive “high”, increased the likelihood that users would develop cravings or risky drug use that disrupts their day-to-day life. “THC has linearly increased over two decades,” said Dr Brook Arterberry, an assistant professor of psychology at Iowa State University who led this research. Increases in THC content have been made possible because of modern growing techniques and in America average levels have risen from 3.5 per cent THC in 1994 to 12.3 per cent in 2012. In annual follow-ups, users who reported that they had started smoking skunk – with an average THC content of 12.3 per cent – were 4.8 times more likely to have one or more symptoms of cannabis use disorder when compared to those smoking a 4.9 per cent strain. Cannabis is not typically thought of as addictive in the same way as heroin, cocaine, or even alcohol, where withdrawal can have serious physical health effects. In April, HPIL, SAM, and Stephenson High School Students held a press conference highlighting a cost report that found marijuana legalization would cost the state of Illinois upwards of $670 million, far outweighing prospective tax revenues. After this, pro-pot politicians lost traction on their plan and the session ended with no legalization. Advocates across the country all came together to push back on Big Marijuana’s attempts to further their addiction-for-profit scheme and together, we notched resounding victories. (Alexandria, VA) - In the past few years, marijuana use is up significantly, by 10%, among 10th graders, and current vaping of marijuana is up 63% for eighth and tenth graders and 53% for twelfth graders, according to new numbers from the largest drug use survey in the United States. Over the past two years, marijuana use among tenth graders rose 10%, a significant increase. Today’s marijuana is especially harmful to adolescents and is known to have a whole host of damaging effects on developing brains. Adolescent marijuana use severely impacts the ability of our youth to learn, greatly increases the risk of serious mental illness, impairs memory, and can even result in a loss of up to eight IQ points. Evidence shows that marijuana – which has skyrocketed in average potency over the past decades - is addictive and harmful to the human brain especially when used by adolescents. In states that have already legalized the drug, there has been an increase in drugged driving crashes, youth marijuana use, and costs that far outweigh pot revenues.These states have seen a black\n\nThere are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Can I use marijuana and go to work?3.I strongly advise my patients to avoid them.I believe the risk of dabbing and the use of strong concentrates, e.g., shatter and wax, far outweighs their benefit, especially in late adolescence and early adulthood.Careful attention to an individual's mental health history, such as a diagnosis of addiction, depression, anxiety, or a mood disorder, or a family history of addiction, should serve as a warning to the possibility of marijuana being a potential problem. Behavioral support has been effective in treating marijuana addiction. Marijuana potency has steadily increased over the past two decades. THC content increased from 3.7 to 7.5 percent in the early 1990s to 9.6 to 16 percent in 2013. With the advent of THC concentrates, such as shatter and wax (see Chapter 4), the addiction potential of marijuana has increased considerably. The highest-potency marijuana flower available today contains at most 25 to 30 percent THC. But the concentrates can contain up to 95 percent or more THC. The effect is so intense and the addiction potential so much greater that they have been described as the \"crack cocaine of marijuana.\" Researchers do not yet know the full extent of the consequences when the body and brain (especially the developing brain) are exposed to extremely high concentrations of THC or whether the recent increases in emergency department visits by people testing positive for marijuana are related to rising potency. There are many variables to consider in responding to this question.Each of us is unique and will respond a bit differently to marijuana.As you'll learn in question 5, the marijuana products most effective for relieving pain are not strongly psychoactive, and the effect of the THC in them is mitigated by both CBD and the pain itself. Synthetic marijuana compounds began to be manufactured and sold in the early 2000s. From 2008 to \n\nThe metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.THC distributes throughout the body, with THC metabolites depositing in the fat stores of the body.Marijuana produces a dreamy euphoria, which has qualities similar to that of alcohol or opioid intoxication. \"Street\" jargon includes: blunts (hollowed-out cigars packed with marijuana), colas (buds of the cannabis plant, which are preferred by marijuana users because of their higher content of delta-9-THC, the active ingredient in marijuana), and hashish or hash (the most potent form, which comes from the resin of the cannabis plant when it is separated from the plant material). The major or most potent psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is THC. THC is present in marijuana in concentrations from 2–15%. The source of marijuana determines its THC concentration, depending upon the species, growth environment, part of the plant that is harvested, and where it comes from. However, the greater euphoria of higher-potency marijuana can lead to more marijuana use and abuse, as well as more side effects. The most common route of administration of marijuana is smoking, although some is ingested orally in homemade foods (e.g., brownies) or in a pharmaceutical product known as dronabinol (Marinol). When smoked, THC enters the circulation almost immediately, reaching high blood levels in 5–10 minutes. Marijuana produces a dreamy euphoria, which has qualities similar to that of alcohol or opioid intoxication. THC distributes throughout the body, with THC metabolites depositing in the fat stores of the body. The metabolites leave the stores slowly over a period of weeks, and they can be detected in urine samples to indicate that a person smoked marijuana many days ago.Although there is a severe shortage of good information about the sociological and long-term effects of marijuana, there is no shortage of information on where THC acts in the brain.A number of studies have isolated the \"cannabinoid receptor\" (CB), which appears to be distributed widely throughout the CNS (Pertwee, 2006). The increased potency of marijuana in the USA over the past four decades can be attributed to several factors. One reason is the shift in the source of marijuana supply from foreign to domestic. Growers have learned to manipulate various factors such as lighting, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels to enhance the THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) content in marijuana plants. Changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana also play a role in the perceived increase in potency. Testing artifacts, such as improved testing methods and increased accuracy in measuring THC levels, may contribute to the apparent rise in potency. It's important to note that the potency measurements may not solely reflect the actual increase in THC content but could be influenced by improvements in testing procedures. A study using data from the Potency Monitoring Program found that when adjusting for marijuana quality, the reported increase in THC% between the 1970s and the 2000s is estimated to be about 57-67% as great as initially reported. This suggests that the long-term rise in potency may be slightly overestimated due to data quality issues and the need to account for the quality of the tested marijuana. In conclusion, the increased potency of marijuana in the USA can be attributed to a combination of factors including the shift to domestic cultivation, advancements in cultivation techniques, and changes in testing procedures.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Medical experts need to rethink how highly infectious diseases are handled in the US, according to a US health official, after a Dallas health worker contracted Ebola despite wearing protective gear while caring for a dying Liberian patient. As an outbreak of the deadly virus spread beyond West Africa, hospitals and nursing associations across the US were taking a closer look at how prepared they were to handle such infections. \"We have to rethink the way we address Ebola infection control. \"The care of Ebola is hard. Nina Pham, 26, the Texas nurse, repeatedly visited Thomas Eric Duncan's room from the day he was admitted to the intensive care unit until the day before he died, medical records show. Pham's family told WFAA-TV in Dallas on Monday that she was the health worker with Ebola. A rector at her family's church, Hung Le, told the Associated Press news agency that Pham's mother told him Pham has the virus. She is in isolation and in stable condition, health officials said. By Monday evening, she had received a transfusion of plasma from a doctor who survived the virus, according to her pastor and the nonprofit medical mission group Samaritan's Purse. Frieden said he would not be surprised if another hospital worker who cared for Duncan becomes ill because Ebola patients become more contagious as the disease progresses. He has said a breach of protocol led to the nurse's infection, but officials are not sure what went wrong. When asked how many health workers are being checked, Frieden said officials \"don't have a number\". Health officials have relied on a \"self-monitoring\" system when it comes to US health workers who care for isolated Ebola patients and wear recommended protective equipment. Besides the workers, health officials continue to track 48 people who were in contact before Duncan was admitted to the hospital and placed in isolation. Meanwhile, in Washington DC, President Barack Obama has urged his top national security and public health officials to incorporate lessons from the Duncan case into the US response plans to the deadly virus. He also called on the international community to deliver assistance more quickly to the countries of West Africa that are struggling against the disease. Obama held a meeting with senior advisers in the Oval Office on Monday and placed calls to Ban Ki-moon, the UN chief, and French President Francois Hollande. Obama met Susan Rice, national security adviser; Sylvia Burwell, health and human services secretary; and Lisa Monaco, his top aide on homeland security and counterterrorism issues. The White House said that in his call with Ban, Obama \"stressed the need for all UN member states to support the UN appeal, and to provide the personnel, equipment, and supplies required to stop the epidemic at its source and halt the devastating impact of this crisis on the affected countries and their citizens\". Elsewhere, a brief scare at Boston's Logan International Airport caused emergency crews in protective gear to remove five passengers with flu-like symptoms from Emirates flight 237 from Dubai, but the CDC later said there was no Ebola threat.

By using CT scans on the mummy of Tutankhamun, Saleem and Hawass determined that he was around 19 years old when he was mummified. In December 2000, a joint team from Waseda University in Japan and Cairo's Ain Shams University tried to get permission for DNA testing of Egyptian mummies, but was denied by the Egyptian Government. In February 2010, Hawass and his team announced that they had analyzed the mummies of Tutankhamun and ten other mummies and said that the king could have died from a malaria infection that followed a leg fracture. German researchers Christian Timmann and Christian Meyer have cast doubt on this theory, suggesting other possible alternatives for Tutankhamun's cause of death. In 2012, a study signed by Hawass disclosed that Ramses III may have had a haplogroup that is associated with the Bantu expansion and is the most dominant in Sub-Saharan Africa, E1b1a.<ref name=HawassZinkBMJ12>\n\n and children were found, dates back to the Greco-Roman period between 332 BC and 395 AD.

A team of doctors, under the leadership of Dr. Zahi Hawass, took DNA samples from bone tissue of the eleven mummies to determine a family pedigree and to determine if any familial or pathological diseases caused Tutankhamun's death. It was discovered that Tutankhamun's family had a large number of irregularities. Four of the mummies, including Tutankhamun, were shown to have had malaria. Based on all the data, the study concluded the most likely cause of death for the young king was the combination of avascular necrosis, malaria and a leg fracture. The presence of 130 canes in the tomb was used as evidence to support Hawass's claim that Tutankhamun suffered from a walking impairment.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Treatment is intended to keep the person safe, stabilize the person’s acute psychiatric symptoms, and return the person to their familiar living situation and treatment as soon as possible. In Oregon, a facility for up to five residents is licensed as a Residential Treatment Home (OAR 309-035-0250). Facilities of six beds or more require licensing as a Residential Treatment Facility (OAR 309-035-0100). These facilities are commonly limited to 16 residents, as this is the maximum number of residents permitted to still qualify for Medicaid reimbursement. The State of Oregon has rules for different “Classes” of facilities (OAR 309-033-0520) based on the level of restriction permitted on the person’s freedom of movement. Class 3 facilities are not locked; admission and discharge are voluntary on the part of the person, and the person must be released upon the person’s request (unless this presents a danger to themselves or others, at which time other legal means must be utilized). Crisis respite stays in Oregon are limited to 30 days by OAR. In our experience, the typical length of stay is around three to five days, and extensions may be granted when it is clinically appropriate and no less restrictive alternative is available. With the right design, a facility can be built as a “free-standing” unit with a singular purpose or it can have different areas or “pods” for different populations and treatment issues. ColumbiaCare Services takes the “treatment” part of “residential treatment facility” seriously, and does not separate day-to-day operations of the facility from treatment. Close, accessible oversight provided by experienced mental health professionals at the management level help guide these activities and assures quality. ColumbiaCare has worked with persons experiencing severe psychiatric distress and suicidal and homicidal feelings and actions. Our experience indicates that none of our partner organizations believe that locking up Individuals with a mental health crisis in a hospital hold room or a jail is the most effective, safest, or most preferable option. However, when there is a safer, more effective, and accessible option for Individuals experiencing a severe mental health crisis such as a CRC, these essential community partners are very appreciative of these resources. ColumbiaCare’s experience indicates that this mutual problem solving process forms the basis for developing a shared partnership strategy that is focused on an Individual’s safety in the least restrictive, most effective environment. ColumbiaCare data and experience prove that diverting people from hospitals effectively reduces police involvements in facilities where that has been an issue. Statistics are indicative of this success, given that ColumbiaCare CRCs show a minimum 94% of individuals admitted through referrals from crisis workers, hospital emergency rooms, or law enforcement have been diverted from more restrictive hospital or jail placements. While CRC daily rates may vary according to the specific programming being requested (security level of the facility, professional psychiatric services and staffing level); Crisis Resolution Center bed day rates range from $250 to $500 per day. One very conservative savings example is Wasco County, who by investing in Crisis Resolution Center services saved over $257,000 in just 381 days. ColumbiaCare has been providing a full range of mental health and residential services for citizens of Oregon since its inception in 2003, and has since expanded services into Idaho. ColumbiaCare has extensive history and experience in designing, developing (building or remodeling), and/or operating residential treatment programs including 13 licensed treatment facilities providing 24-hour residential services to adults with a primary diagnosis of mental illness. Prior to forming ColumbiaCare beginning in 1995, the current principles of ColumbiaCare managed the community mental health program in Josephine County, giving them almost 15 years of\n\nThe institutions for mental diseases (IMD) exclusion has been in place in Medicaid statute since 1965. Section 1115 demonstration waivers for serious mental illness (SMI) and serious emotional disturbance (SED). Guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) in November 2018 allows states to pay for short-term psychiatric care for adults in IMD settings. In addition, states may also seek Medicaid payment for services provided to individuals 21 years of age or younger in settings that do not meet CMS requirements to qualify for the inpatient psychiatric services for individuals under age 21 benefit (commonly referred to as the psych under 21 benefit). In order to receive demonstration approval, states must meet several criteria, including providing access to a continuum of mental health services, use of a utilization review entity, and certain provider requirements. Section 1115 SUD demonstration waivers. CMS guidance issued in November 2017 outlines the parameters for states to obtain a Section 1115 waiver to pay for short-term residential SUD treatment in IMDs. Among other things, criteria address coverage of certain outpatient and residential services, provider requirements, and evaluation and reporting milestones. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-271) created a new state plan option to allow states to pay for care for Medicaid beneficiaries age 21–64 with at least one SUD in certain IMDs. In order for a state to receive state plan approval, several requirements must be meant including coverage of outpatient, residential, and inpatient services, as well as maintenance of effort requirements. Current Medicaid regulations indicate when managed care organizations (MCOs) can pay for treatment in IMDs as an in-lieu of service. Medicaid payment for IMD services under this authority is limited to 15 days per month. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act of 2018 recently codified this provision (or any successor regulation) into statute. State Medicaid programs are statutorily required to make DSH payments to hospitals that serve a high proportion of Medicaid beneficiaries and other low income patients. States can make DSH payments for uncompensated care costs at IMDs as long as such payments do not exceed the lesser amount of the amount of DSH funds that the state paid IMDs in fiscal year (FY) 1995 or 33 percent of the state’s FY 1995 DSH allotment for all hospitals. In state plan rate year 2014, states made $2.4 billion in DSH payments to IMDs. Maine made DSH payments exclusively to IMDs and four states (Alaska, Connecticut, Maryland, and North Dakota) spent more than half of their DSH allotments on DSH payments to IMDs. Many states are using multiple authorities to pay for services in these settings. to petition a court to order assisted outpatient treatment for patients with such impaired judgment, which compels them to comply with treatment to avoid relapses. One can petition for assisted outpatient treatment along with, or instead of, hospitalization. In Nevada, prior to confining someone, the state must demonstrate that the person \"is mentally ill and, because of that illness, is likely to harm himself or others if allowed his liberty.\" In Oregon, the standard that the allegedly mentally ill person \"Peter [h]as been committed and hospitalized twice in the last three years, is showing symptoms or behavior similar to those that preceded and led to a prior hospitalization and, unless treated, will continue, to a reasonable medical probability, \n\n he led the effort to do a 1332 waiver to reduce health care costs. On prescription drug relief, Feltes authored the historic legislation to import safe, low-cost prescription drugs from Canada for New Hampshire seniors. Feltes passed prescription drug relief for senior citizens who fell in the Medicare Part D \"donut hole\". Patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are particularly vulnerable. In addition, half of the mentally ill homeless population in the United States also suffers from substance abuse and dependence (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration). This combination of mental illness, substance abuse, and poor physical health makes it very difficult for people to obtain employment and residential stability. Better mental health services would combat not only mental illness, but homelessness as well. In a survey by the United States Conference of Mayors (2008), 20% of cities listed better coordination with mental health service providers as one of the top three items needed to combat homelessness. Contrary to popular belief, many homeless people with severe mental illnesses are willing to accept treatment and services. Even if homeless individuals with mental illnesses are provided with housing, they are unlikely to achieve residential stability and remain off the streets unless they have access to continued treatment and services. Unfortunately, lack of funding is a significant barrier to the successful implementation of supported housing programs. Funding is available from various programs run by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as well as from the Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH). Additionally, the United States Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) in February 2009, which includes $1.5 billion for homelessness prevention and re-housing (National Alliance to End Homelessness, 2009). However, there are still not enough resources to provide adequate services to the homeless population and those at risk for homelessness. Efforts need to be made to ensure that these funds are used appropriately, efficiently, and in ways that will most effectively help the mentally ill homeless population. “Ending Homelessness for People With Mental Illnesses and Co-Occurring Disorders.” Apr.

It includes medications, herbal/nutritional supplements, physical interventions, behavioral interventions, prevention trials, and/or diagnostic tools that affect the outcome of the study participants. In addition to the DSM plan, a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is generally required for Phase III clinical trials. For earlier medication trials (Phase I or II) and some behavioral clinical trials, a DSMB may be appropriate if the study has multiple clinical sites, is blinded, is First-in-Man, tests a high-risk intervention, or is conducted in vulnerable populations. In monitoring the data and safety of the trial, The DSMB may recommend continuation of the trial, modifications to the trial, or termination of the trial in the event of overwhelmingly significant efficacy difference between groups or unacceptable adverse events. The overall elements of the DSM plan may vary depending on the potential risks, complexity, and nature of the trial. They also depend on whether it is an initial or a detailed DSM plan. The initial DSM plan should include a brief description of data management methods, collection and reporting of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE), medical safety measures, communication plan with IRB/FDA/NIDA, interim analysis plans, and content and frequency of DSM reports to NIDA. Appendix B, C, and D have samples of initial DSM plans for pharmacotherapy, behavioral, and prevention trials, respectively. A detailed DSM plan must be submitted to and approved by NIDA before starting a new trial. Medication trials: to the IRB, NIDA, and, as applicable to the FDA. Non-medication trials: to the IRB and NIDA. How often are the data reviewed in the course of the trial? According to NIH policy, the detailed monitoring plan must be included as part of the protocol and submitted to the local IRB and reviewed and approved by the funding Institute and Center (IC) before the trial begins. The DSMB evaluated the results of a formal pre-planned interim efficacy analysis in order to assess the efficacy of the injection in the femoral head of 20 million autologous PREOB cells combined with core decompression vs. the injection of placebo combined with core decompression, with the intent to stop the study early if there is overwhelming evidence of treatment benefit or futility. The DSMB reported that PREOB was well-tolerated by patients. However, the interim results suggest that it is unlikely that the primary objective will be achieved at the final analysis. The DSMB therefore recommended the discontinuation of the trial. Based on this recommendation, and while the data is being reviewed, the Company is taking steps to notify investigators that enrolment of patients in the trial is being stopped. The discontinuation of the Phase III hip osteonecrosis study does not affect the clinical development of the allogeneic platform, ALLOB, in other promising indications, with different physiopathology, larger patient populations and faster clinical trial recruitment than in osteonecrosis of the hip. 100 million allogeneic cells or more can be administered with a single local injection, five times more than what was possible with PREOB. As announced recently, the ALLOB platform has further advantages over PREOB including dosing, logistics and scalability, offering substantial advantages in reaching large patient populations in a cost-effective manner. The Company believes it is therefore more economically viable than the autologous product. The Company recently announced the optimisation of the allogeneic manufacturing process which will be implemented in all future clinical development programmes involving the ALLOB platform. Efficacy and safety data for the full set of 32 patients are expected mid-2019, post a follow-up period of 12 months. The Company believes the favorable safety and efficacy profile of JTA-004 observed in this first efficacy study supports the move to registration studies and will begin dialogue with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps. Thomas Lienard, Chief Executive Officer of Bone Therapeutics, commented: “The interim results for PREOB were a disappointment to the Company. The discontinuation of the PREOB study will allow us to fully focus on this more promising platform and accelerate its development. We will also continue to focus resources on JTA-004 in patients with knee osteoarthritis, following the favourable efficacy and safety profile announced last month”. For the interim analysis, a total of 44 patients were either treated with PREOB combined with core decompression or placebo combined with core decompression, and followed up for a period of 12 months. The primary endpoint of the trial was the percentage of responders, i.e. patients showing a clinically relevant pain relief and no progression to fracture stage. • 3M • ABB • Aegon • Allianz • Anglo American plc • Apple • AstraZeneca • Aviva • AXA • Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria • Banco Santander • Barclays • BASF • Bayer • BHP • BP • Bridgestone • Bristol-Myers Squibb • Canon • Carrefour • Caterpillar • Chevron • Citigroup • Coca-Cola • Colgate-Palmolive • Compagnie de Saint-Gobain • Credit Suisse • Daimler • Dell • Deutsche Bank • Deutsche Telekom • Diageo • Dow Chemical • DuPont • E.ON • EMC Corporation • LM Ericsson Telephone Co. – B shares • ExxonMobil • Ford • GDF Suez • General Electric • GlaxoSmithKline • Goldman Sachs • Google • Hewlett-Packard • Honda • HSBC • IBM • ING Group • Intel • Johnson & Johnson • JPMorgan Chase • Kimberly-Clark • L'Oréal • LVMH • McDonald's • \n\nGemtuzumab ozogamicin was approved in 2000 for the treatment of pediatric leukemia on the basis of limited data, but it was withdrawn from the market in 2010 after confirmatory trials initiated in 2004 showed increased mortality and no efficacy.42 p.1258: 42. Food and Drug Administration. Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin): market withdrawal. Silver Spring, MD: FDA, June 21, 2010. WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind., May 2, 2014 – Merck, known as MSD outside the United States and Canada (NYSE: MRK), and Endocyte, Inc. (NASDAQ: ECYT), today announced that the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) of the PROCEED trial has completed a pre specified, interim futility analysis and the DSMB recommended that the trial be stopped because vintafolide did not demonstrate efficacy on the pre-specified outcome of Progression-Free Survival (PFS) in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. The DSMB did not identify any safety concerns for the patients enrolled in the trial. Based on the DSMB recommendation and while further review of the data are conducted, the Companies have taken steps to notify investigators that screening and randomization of participants in the trial will be suspended. PROCEED is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind clinical trial, evaluating vintafolide in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) compared to PLD plus placebo for the treatment of folate receptor-positive, platinum-resistant, ovarian cancer. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health has stopped enrollment into a clinical trial testing the effects of highly concentrated (hypertonic) saline solutions on patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) when given as soon as possible after the injury — that is, before the patient arrives at the hospital or emergency room. Previously enrolled participants who have not yet completed their six month follow-up visits will continue to be monitored according to the study design. \"Improving treatment and survival of traumatic injury are critical public health problems,\" said Elizabeth G. Nabel, M.D., director of the NHLBI, the lead federal sponsor of the research effort. The TBI trial tests whether the hypertonic solutions improve brain function in severely injured patients as measured 6 months after injury, compared to usual care with normal saline. \"Although these findings are disappointing, they nonetheless provide major contributions to our understanding of emergency medical care.\" To ensure patient safety during the study, the DSMB reviews the accrued data approximately every six months or more frequently if needed. The research is typically conducted in real-world settings, where patients collapse or are critically injured and before they reach the hospital. \"By conducting these studies through such a robust network, we can compare clinical interventions in meaningful ways and disseminate the results as quickly as possible, thus saving resources and providing information of immediate benefit to patients.\" The clinical trials are conducted under strict FDA and Canadian guidelines that allow for patients in life-threatening situations to participate in research under an exception to informed consent, according to U.S. and Canadian laws. The NHLBI is the lead sponsor of the ROC studies, and additional funding is provided by the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, US Army Medical Research & Materiel Command, American Heart Association, Defence Research and Development Canada, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These may include coughing, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing, headache, and fever. Well over 200 virus strains are implicated in causing the common cold, with rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses and enteroviruses being the most common. The symptoms are mostly due to the body's immune response to the infection rather than to tissue destruction by the viruses themselves. The symptoms of influenza are similar to those of a cold, although usually more severe and less likely to include a runny nose. There is no vaccine for the common cold. The common cold is the most frequent infectious disease in humans. These infections have existed throughout human history. Signs and symptoms The typical symptoms of a cold include cough, runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion, and a sore throat, sometimes accompanied by muscle ache, fatigue, headache, and loss of appetite. The cough is usually mild compared to that accompanying influenza. While a cough and a fever indicate a higher likelihood of influenza in adults, a great deal of similarity exists between these two conditions. A number of the viruses that cause the common cold may also result in asymptomatic infections. Progression A cold usually begins with fatigue, a feeling of being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, followed in a couple of days by a runny nose and cough. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%. Causes Viruses The common cold is an infection of the upper respiratory tract which can be caused by many different viruses. The most commonly implicated is a rhinovirus (30–80%), a type of picornavirus with 99 known serotypes. Other commonly implicated viruses include human coronaviruses (≈ 15%), influenza viruses (10–15%), adenoviruses (5%), human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses other than rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, and human metapneumovirus. In total, more than 200 viral types are associated with colds. Transmission The common cold virus is typically transmitted via airborne droplets (aerosols), direct contact with infected nasal secretions, or fomites (contaminated objects). Rhinovirus-caused colds are most infectious during the first three days of symptoms; they are much less infectious afterwards. Although it is now known that colds are viral infections, the prevalence of many such viruses are indeed seasonal, occurring more frequently during cold weather. Other Herd immunity, generated from previous exposure to cold viruses, plays an important role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. Pathophysiology The symptoms of the common cold are believed to be primarily related to the immune response to the virus. For example, the rhinovirus is typically acquired by direct contact; it binds to humans via ICAM-1 receptors and the CDHR3 receptor through unknown mechanisms to trigger the release of inflammatory mediators. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), on the other hand, is contracted by direct contact and airborne droplets. Human parainfluenza virus typically results in inflammation of the nose, throat, and bronchi. Diagnosis The distinction between viral upper respiratory tract infections is loosely based on the location of symptoms, with the common cold affecting primarily the nose (rhinitis), throat (pharyngitis), and lungs (bronchitis). Isolation of the viral agent involved is rarely performed, and it is generally not possible to identify the virus type through symptoms. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Whether the addition of antivirals or antibacterials\n\n Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, but often include fever, cough, headache, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. Some of the symptoms that COVID-19 patients could experience is shortness of breath (which might be a sign of pneumonia), cough, fever, and diarrhea. The three most recorded and common symptoms are fever, tiredness, and coughing, as reported by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 is also categorized among the viruses that can show no symptoms in the \n\nSome common respiratory viruses include RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), influenza virus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus. RSV is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children. It can lead to a range of respiratory symptoms including cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, body aches, and fatigue. Rhinovirus is the most common cause of the common cold. It typically causes symptoms like runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and mild coughing. Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, loss of taste or smell, fatigue, and muscle pain. They often present with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, runny nose, coughing, and pink eye. Parainfluenza viruses are another common cause of respiratory infections in both children and adults. It's important to note that diagnosis for these respiratory viruses may involve techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing or chest X-rays (CXR) to confirm the presence of the virus or assess any related complications. Overall, understanding the characteristics of these common respiratory viruses can help healthcare professionals accurately diagnose and manage respiratory infections.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Since the early 2000s, CSPI has worked with policymakers and advocates in Philadelphia, New York City, California, and numerous other jurisdictions to pass laws to list calories on menus and menu boards. In addition to making calorie information available to consumers, a key benefit of menu labeling has been the reformulation of existing food items and the introduction of nutritionally improved items in many chain restaurants. In 2010, CSPI successfully lobbied for a provision, which was passed as part of the Affordable Care Act, to require calorie labeling on menus at chain restaurants and similar retail food establishments nationwide. The FDA proposed regulations for menu labeling in 2011, and CSPI has since worked to continue to mobilize support for national menu labeling, diffuse opposition from Congress and special interests, and encourage the FDA to strengthen the final regulations and release them in a timely manner. Menu labeling was implemented nationally in 2018. Media attention given to celebrity British chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Heston Blumenthal, Marco Pierre White and many others with television shows and books encouraging home produced meals may have had a limited short-term impact on the growth of fast food chains such as McDonald's and Burger King.

The companies were accused of failing to provide adequate warning about potential side effects of the drug, which include diabetes, weight gain, neurological problems and increased risk of strokes and death in elderly patients with dementia. Fletch Trammell, a lawyer in the case who had used Risperdal, said that J&J hid studies that showed Risperdal caused diabetes at a higher rate than a competing drug. The fine for the Medicaid fraud portion of the case, at $5,000 per prescription, was the state’s minimum. A 12 person jury deliberated for three hours before finding against J&J. Arkansas is just one of several states suing over Risperdal. South Carolina and Texas have already reached settlements with J&J in their lawsuits. J&J plans to appeal the Arkansas ruling, claiming it did not break the law and that the package insert that comes with the medication was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Corporate Accountability International (CAI), a group that challenges corporate abuses, posted an open letter on its website asking hospitals that house McDonalds restaurants to end their contracts with the fast food chain to “stop fostering a food environment that promotes harm, not health.” The letter points out that the rates at which children suffer from diet-related illnesses like diabetes are “staggering,” and the problem is related in part to the consumption of junk food. Locating McDonalds stores in hospitals is part of a marketing strategy, CAI says, that is aimed at imparting an aura of healthfulness to the food — a goal that is inconsistent with the goals of a health institution. But these efforts cannot compete with the profit-driven mechanisms by which McDonalds and the fast food industry operate their business, and the toll that McDonalds’ practices have had on children’s health,” the letter states. CAI’s petition to get McDonalds out of hospitals is here. Kraft Foods, Coke, Pepsi, Intuit and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have all pulled their support of the controversial corporate bill mill the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). ALEC is a members-only group that exposes state legislators to corporate lobbyists several times throughout the year at conferences and gatherings at tony beach-front spa and golf resorts. Such laws have been spread in part through the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a corporate-backed group in which corporations partner with legislators behind closed doors to promote conservative, pro-business bills. Fifty-eight percent of Facebook users are women, and women account for over 70 percent of daily fan activity on the site, but when Facebook goes public a few weeks from now, its board of directors will consist of only seven white men, and no women. To address this inequity, the women’s rights group Ultraviolet has started circulating a petition, and a group of women from across the world have started a campaign called “Face It” to pressure Facebook to include women — and expand the diversity — on its board. What’s raising eyebrows even more about the complete absence of women from the board is the extent to which Facebook depends on women, since women are known to be more avid users of Facebook than men and account for about 70 percent of Facebook’s fan activity. Facebook’s estimated $100 billion public stock offering would not be anywhere as big as it is without massive participation from women — a fact that the demographics of its board fails to reflect.

A new study reveals PR strategies transnational tobacco companies use behind the scenes to derail, delay and undermine public health policies in low- and middle-income countries. The authors uncovered six core strategies tobacco companies use in Thailand to interfere in tobacco control policymakin: (1) doing business with “two faces,” (2) working to influence people in high places, (3) “buying” advocates inside grassroots organizations, (4) putting up deceptive fronts, (5) using intimidation, and (6) undermining controls on tobacco advertising, promotion and sponsorship. The companies often apply several of the strategies simultaneously. Public health advocates in poorer countries have successfully counteracted these strategies by remaining vigilant to spot them, excluding tobacco companies from policymaking, restricting cigarette sales, keeping up pressure on the companies and working to assure adequate resources are dedicated to enforcing tobacco control regulations.

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. In animal models statins have been shown to decrease the size of gallstones. The evidence concerning the association between statins and the risk of acute pancreatitis is inconclusive. Findings in case reports and two case–control studies have suggested that statins increase the risk of acute pancreatitis, whereas a recent meta-analysis suggested a protective association. To investigate the relationship of statins and pancreatitis, we carried out two studies in Kuopio University Hospital (461 admissions of patients with AP and 1140 patients with gallstones between 2008 - 2010) including patient cohort during (272 statin users and 272 controls). In patients with cholecystectomy there was no significant difference in outcome between the statin users and non-users, although statin users had more polypharmacy (including drugs that cause bleeding) and cardiovascular illnesses than non-users. The mean operation time for laparoscopic cholecystectomy was 10% shorter for the patients with statin use than for the patients without. Together with the Finnish Medicine Agency (Fimea) we carried out a large nationwide study and found that statin use was associated with an increased incidence of AP (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.13-1.39). The incidence was elevated especially during the first year of use both among current and former statin users. Interestingly, the patients using lipid-lowering drugs had gallbladder stones in surgery less frequently than those without statins. Based on these data it is concluded that statin medication seems to affect the bile metabolisms also humans and patients who use statins have increased risk of pancreatitis. Cholecystectomy in statin-using patients is as safe as in non-users although statin users had more comorbidities than non-users. Sanofi and Regeneron said they did not know how the FDA learned of the potential side effects, and they were not aware of any such side effects with alirocumab. Sanofi's report echoed a filing made by Regeneron last month, in which the company said the FDA advised it was aware of adverse neurocognitive effects associated with PCSK9 inhibitors. Experts urge doctors to reconsider statins for obese patients after finding the cholesterol drug may block some benefits of exercise. Statins, the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, are often suggested to lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease in individuals with obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, which is a combination of medical disorders including excess body fat and/or high levels of blood pressure, blood sugar, and/or cholesterol. Researchers, however, found that simvastatin, a generic type of statin previously sold under the brand name Zocor, hindered the positive effects of exercise for obese and overweight adults. Thyfault says many cardiologists want to prescribe statins to all patients over a certain age regardless of whether they have metabolic syndrome; the drugs also are recommended for people with Type 2 diabetes. He recommends that cardiologists more closely weigh the benefits and risks of statins given this new data about their effect on exercise training. Statins significantly affected participants’ exercise outcomes. Participants in the exercise-only group increased their cardiorespiratory fitness by an average of 10 percent compared to a 1.5 percent increase among participants also prescribed statins. Additionally, skeletal muscle mitochondrial content, the site where muscle cells turn oxygen into energy, decreased by 4.5 percent in the group taking statins while the exercise-only group had a 13 percent increase, a normal response following exercise training. Starting a statin regimen after exercising and obtaining a higher fitness level may reduce the drugs’ effects on fitness, he says. Merck in December said Tredaptive did no better in the study at preventing heart attacks, deaths or strokes than traditional statin drugs that lower \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. ; Anesthesia: General anesthetics during surgery may cause bladder atony by acting as a smooth muscle relaxant.

They found patients taking high potency statins had a 34 per cent higher risk of being hospitalised for acute kidney injury, compared with those taking low doses. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. Rates were not significantly increased in patients with chronic kidney disease. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’. The risk of type 2 diabetes is raised by 12 per cent with high dose statins compared with moderate doses, according to a study. Lead researcher Professor Colin Dormuth, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said further investigation was necessary to determine how statins might be causing kidney injury. It could be due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, or because use of statins can deplete the body's stores of CoQ10, a naturally-occurring nutrient important for energy production in cells. Some studies suggest statins may protect against health problems, including blood clots, Alzheimer's and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain. They may also cut the risk of dying from pneumonia.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It poses a significant health risk to both dogs and humans who come into contact with it, and may lead to fever, lethargy, vomit­ing, kidney failure, liver failure, and even death in some untreated individu­als. Blue-green algae may be found in fresh or brackish waters and often appears as either foam, scum, or mats of red, green, or brown algae. Water contami­nated with this organism may smell musty or foul and should definitely be avoided. If your dog’s fur becomes contaminated by this algae, it should be washed thoroughly. Consider boiling drinking water for both yourself and your dog if backpacking with your furry compan­ion in areas known to have high levels of Giardia, Cryptosporidium, or other infectious organisms. As always, consult with your veterinarian if you have spe­cific questions about potential health problems, as well as both prevention and treatment of these various water­borne illnesses. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, are one of the common causes of water pollution. They can cause cyanobacteria poisoning or cyanide poisoning. Cyanobacteria produce toxins called cyanotoxins, which can contaminate water bodies and pose a threat to humans, animals, and marine life. It's important to note that cyanobacteria poisoning is just one type of water pollution-related poisoning. Other sources of water pollution can cause different types of poisoning, depending on the specific contaminants involved. Each type of poisoning has its own set of symptoms and health consequences. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favoured at higher temperatures which enable Microcystis species to outcompete diatoms and green algae, and potentially allow \n\nIn Victoria, Australia, 17 sheep died and many others showed signs of light sensitivity after drinking from a lake affected by a thick bloom of M. aeruginosa.In the USA, a colourless alga is reported to have caused dysentery, blindness and deafness, and sometimes ataxia and head-tilting.Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark.Nalila salina (originally from Lake Uroumich, northern Iran) is rich (12 per cent of dry matter) in natural carotenoids. ## Algae Poisoning\n\nToxic freshwater algae, characteristically blue-green in colour, are found in summer on lakes in numerous locations, particularly where water has a high phosphate and nitrate content derived from farm land. The main toxic freshwater cyanobacteria are strains of the unicellular Microcystis aeruginosa, and the filamentous forms Anabaena flos-aquae, Aphanizomenon and Oscillatoria agardhii. Poisoning by algae has been recorded in dogs that have been in the sea off Denmark. In Victoria, Australia, 17 sheep died and many others showed signs of light sensitivity after drinking from a lake affected by a thick bloom of M. aeruginosa.Poisoning in cattle was suspected in the UK after a spell of hot weather in East Anglia caused an algal bloom in field ponds and 50 per cent of the cows in a herd suddenly showed nervous signs.BSE was ruled out as the cause.## Alimentary Canal\n\n(See DIGESTION, ABSORPTION AND ASSIMILATION. Cyanobacteria poisoning, also known as blue-green algae poisoning, refers to the toxic effects caused by the ingestion or inhalation of cyanobacteria, particularly from contaminated water sources. Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic bacteria that can produce toxins under certain conditions. These toxins can pose a risk to human and animal health. Symptoms of cyanobacteria poisoning can vary depending on the specific toxins produced and the amount ingested. Additionally, exposure to cyanobacteria toxins can cause skin rashes, respiratory irritation, and allergic reactions. Cyanobacteria blooms typically occur in bodies of water, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, that have high levels of nutrients and warm temperatures. To prevent cyanobacteria poisoning, it is important to avoid exposure to potentially contaminated water sources. This includes avoiding swimming or recreating in water bodies with visible cyanobacteria blooms or scum. It is also advised to not use untreated water for drinking, cooking, or any other purpose if cyanobacteria blooms are present or suspected. Water treatment methods, such as filtration and disinfection, can be effective in removing or inactivating cyanobacteria and their toxins. If you suspect cyanobacteria poisoning after exposure to contaminated water, it is crucial to seek medical attention immediately.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Temporary restrictions are sometimes called \"deferrals\", since blood donors who are found ineligible may be found eligible at a later date. However, many deferrals are indefinite meaning that donation are not accepted at any point in the future, constituting a de facto ban. Restrictions vary from country to country, and in some countries practice of protected sex or periods of abstinence are not considered. With regard to blood donation, the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) enforces a three-month deferral period for MSM and women who have sex with MSM. In Canada, the deferral period for MSM blood donors was decreased to 3 months in June 2019. Many LGBT organizations view the restrictions on donation as based on homophobia and not based on valid medical concern since donations are rigorously tested to rule out donors that are infected with known viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. They state the deferrals are based on stereotypes. Proponents of the lifetime restriction defend it because of the asserted risk of false negative test results and because the MSM population in developed countries tends to have a higher prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection. The UK government advisory committee, SABTO, stated in 2013 that \"the risk of transfusion of HIV infected blood would increase if MSM were allowed to donate blood\". In July 2017 however, the UK government reduced the one year deferral window to three months, to take effect in the following months, resulting from SABTO's updated conclusions that \"new testing systems were accurate and donors were good at complying with the rules\". Advocates for change to MSM prohibitions point out that screening of donors should focus on sexual behavior as well as safe sex practices since many MSM may always have protected sex, be monogamous, or be in other low risk categories. Since 1982, the risk for HIV infection transmitted via transfusion has been almost eliminated by the use of questionnaires to exclude donors at higher risk for HIV infection and performing screening tests with highly sensitive equipment to identify infected blood donations. According to the 2015 surveillance report by Canadian Blood Services, the risk of HIV transfusion-transmitted infection was fairly low: in 1 in 21.4 million donations. People who contracted HIV from a contaminated blood transfusion include Isaac Asimov, who received a blood transfusion following a cardiac surgery. Current situation List of countries with their stand on MSM blood donors This list shows countries that had restrictions on blood donors. The donation is allowed if the donor hasn't had a risky sexual encounter, but not depending on the sexual orientation of the donor. The UK since November 2017 has implemented a 3-month deferral policy on all gay/bi men who want to donate their blood. The Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs recommended the policy change after a study concluded that a total ban may breach equality legislation and that the risk of HIV reaching the blood supply would only increase by approximately 2%. He argued that the questionnaire and interview process used by the IBTS does not adequately assess the risk of disease transmission posed by his donation. He said that both failed to consider the length of time between a donor's last sexual experience and the end of a \"window period\" in which infections are sometimes not detected. Following several adjournments of the case to allow the blood service and Department of Health to examine and develop the donation policies, in late June 2016 the Irish Blood Transfusion Service recommended that the lifetime ban on MSM be reduced to a 12-month ban. On 26 July 2016, Tomás Heneghan dropped his High Court challenge against the service as an end to the lifetime deferral on MSM blood donors had been announced in the interim.

The test looks for a biomarker called glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is released into the bloodstream when the brain is injured. In nearly 600 patients age 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussion with up to 97 percent accuracy, the researchers said. \"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa, a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded researcher. The test could also help to identify patients who need neurosurgery and could significantly reduce the use of CT scans to diagnose concussions, according to the study published online March 28 in the journal JAMA Neurology. An estimated 250,000 U.S. children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports -- nearly 700 a day. As a result, it can be difficult for doctors to determine the severity of the injury, Papa said. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. ; Enzyme assay: A recent development in diagnosis of NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing lysosomal \n\nCould A Blood Test Predict Concussions In Children? Researchers believe that a blood test may be helpful in determining whether a child has sustained a concussion, as well as determining ithe severity of the problem. A new study found that a blood test correctly identified the presence of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) 94 percent of the time. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. During the study, researchers performed CT scans on 152 children in the study while comparing the results of the scans with results from the blood tests. While the CT scans helped to identify which patients suffered visible TBIs, the blood test also detected the symptoms of concussions even when the brain injuries were not visible on CT scans. As it stands, most children with concussions are diagnosed by symptoms alone. Typically, these are observed via vomitting or balance problems or can be reported by the child through headache, blurred vision or feeling groggy. However, these do not really give doctors an objective indication of the severity of the injury.

To make people more aware of the continued threat and precautions to take, national and international health organizations have designated September 28, 2011, as World Rabies Day. Vaccination could reduce or eliminate this risk, and a goal of the World Rabies Day campaign is to ensure more widespread vaccination of dogs. Remember, above all, keep your pets vaccinated against rabies, and stay away from wild animals, especially those known to carry the virus. Rabies transmission from dogs to humans has been known since ancient times. The boy lived and did not develop rabies. Even today, with widespread vaccine campaigns targeting domestic pets, rabies persists in some wild populations, such as bats, where infection rates run about 6%. Where bats occur, health officials struggle to keep the public informed, warning that no bat should ever be touched or handled because of the risk of rabies transmission. One study found that 46% of rabies-related bites came from bats, and the huge majority of these infectious bites occur during the summer months. Other wild animals that carry rabies include foxes, raccoons, skunks, and coyotes. It’s pretty straightforward to avoid contracting rabies, but children in particular need to be educated about the rules: avoid contact with all wild animals known to transmit the disease, including bats, foxes, coyotes, and skunks. Never touch or approach an injured animal, and if you have a domesticated pet, such as a dog or cat, be sure that Spot or Fifi is completely up to date on all vaccines. What is rabies and how do people get it? In 1999, skunks accounted for 21 of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky. Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Confine your pet or otherwise make sure it does not run away. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Vaccination of all dogs, cats and ferrets on the premises protects them from the risk of rabies. Bats accounted for six of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1999. Rabies from bats is the most common source of human infection in the United States. Contact your veterinarian or local animal control personnel for information. Your local health department has proper containers and instructions for submitting an animal specimen for rabies testing. Most fatalities from rabies occur when people fail to seek prompt medical assistance or are unaware of the exposure, as with some of the cases associated with bat rabies. Many countries have a much higher risk of rabies exposure than the United States. In 1998, four cases of rabies in horses were confirmed in Kentucky. Proper and up-to-date vaccination of your pets is your first line of defense against rabies. WELD COUNTY, Colo. — In recent months, five skunks have tested positive for rabies near the Colorado towns of Severance, Pierce, and Grover. Some animal and human exposures have occurred, and they all are receiving treatment. Four people are receiving post exposure prophylaxis after handling their pets which encountered the skunks. A total of 14 dogs were also exposed. Health officials continue to educate the public about preventing rabies exposure. \"Rabies can infect any mammal,\" said Mark E. Wallace, MD, MPH, executive director of the Weld County Health Department. In past years, domestic bison and horses have contracted rabies, in addition to a variety of wildlife. \"The risk of human exposure to rabies increases when pets and domestic animals are not properly vaccinated. If you are in direct contact with a rabid animal, such as a skunk or bat, your risk is much higher,\" Wallace said. Rabies can infect many wild animals, including skunks, foxes, raccoons, coyotes, and bats. Health officials recommend all domestic animals such as cats, dogs, horses and livestock be vaccinated against rabies by a licensed veterinarian. PROGRAM GOAL: To prevent human cases of rabies by investigating all reported animal bites, and by vaccinating dogs against rabies. The present raccoon rabies epidemic was first confirmed in the Mid-Atlantic and North-eastern states in 1977, and has continued to spread to other states. Hundreds of animal bites are reported in Wayne County each year. Any warm-blooded animal can contract the illness; however, typical wildlife rabies is spread by raccoons, skunks, bats, and fox. In past few years several rabid animals (all bats) have been found in Wayne County. Infected wild animals can pass rabies to pets. Animals which are very rarely affected are rats, mice, squirrels, hamsters, and rabbits. Fortunately, few human cases of rabies are reported (1 case in Ohio since 1970 and 32 cases in the U.S. since 1980). How do I know an Animal is Rabid? Animals who exhibit unusual or abnormal behavior should be considered a risk. Rabid animals may stagger, appear restless, change the tone of their bark or growl, appear to be choking, or become excitable/irritable or aggressive. If bitten or scratched, see your doctor and report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District. Report contacts between your pets and wild animals to your veterinarian. If it can be done safely, try to detain or hold the animal, so it can be quarantined/tested for rabies. Report the bite to the Wayne County General Health District and provide the following information using this Bite Report Form. There is still no cure for rabies once symptoms develop. The disease can be stopped in people, if a series of rabies immunizations are given soon after the exposure to the virus. Recently the Toronto Public Health Services received confirmation of this year’s first positive rabid bat in Hamilton. I am writing this blog regarding rabies in bats, raccoons and other wildlife so you will know what prevention steps to take, learn about the symptoms, steps to take if you are bitten and not to panic! In Canada, common carriers of rabies are bats, raccoon, skunk and foxes. Recently the most human-rabies cases have been contracted by rabies in bats. There are several strains presently in Ontario, there are skunk and fox strains, raccoon strains and bats have several strains. If you get bitten or scratched by a rabid animal, seek treatment immediately from a local physician or hospital. There are several strains in Ontario, to control this the Ministry of Natural Resource (MNR) distributes baits for wildlife to eat each year. The bait contains a rabies vaccine that is absorbed through the lining of the mouth. Be sure to take the proper precautions when around bats. An animal that has contracted rabies will have flu-like symptoms, severe headache, and fever. In humans early symptoms is numbness or itchiness around the bite area, flu like symptoms and headache progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. Raccoons can pick up various strains of rabies, but they are most susceptible to the raccoon strain. Raccoons are generally a nocturnal animal, so if you spot a raccoon exhibiting abnormal behaviour especially in the day, be alert and keep your distance. As a precaution, all bites or scratches by raccoons should be considered a possible exposure to the rabies virus. Raccoons may incubate rabies for long periods (months) without becoming ill. Don’t attract raccoons to your property, consider feeding pets indoors, not over filling bird feeders, cleaning up well after BBQ’s and keeping bins securely closed. Rabid bats accounted for 27 of the 28 rabies cases in 2013. As bats in Canada are insectivores, no efficient way of vaccinating them has yet been found. Local or state health officials should be consulted to help determine if rabies treatment is needed. Ontario law requires that all dogs and cats be vaccinated against rabies and their shots kept up-to-date. To further protect your pets, keep them indoors at night to limit their exposure, the time when foxes, skunks, bats and raccoons are most active. If you encounter a rabid animal keep your distance and call the Rabies Hotline at 1-888-574-6656. Here are some tips on preventing wildlife on your property.

Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision. Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose. Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs). Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds, which consume insects as a primary food source. Michigan State University also investigated the source of the kidney failure and made available to researchers and veterinarians pictures and photographs of affected animal kidneys \"demonstrating acute tubular necrosis in the kidney with intratubular crystals.\" On 27 March, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals reported the symptoms described in affected animals are not \"fully consistent with the ingestion of rat poison containing aminopterin.\" To reduce the risk of their animals being infected with this disease, farmers used to shoot desert warthogs. The Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study (SCWDS) worked in concert with the USDA to identify and eliminate feral swine populations which harbored the ASF virus in Haiti. SCWDS enlisted the use of American and Haitian hog-hunting dogs to reduce the populations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, women who take Actos for type 2 diabetes not only are at risk for bladder cancer but are also at risk for fractures known as secondary osteoporosis. Type 2 diabetes is manageable with a complementary prescription drug and nutrition. But bladder cancer and bone fractures? At the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, their study aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with thiazolidinedione therapy and to evaluate the effect on bone density. Interpretation: Long-term thiazolidinedione use doubles the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. In yet another study, there was evidence that both the TZD class of drugs causes bone loss and increase fracture risk, specifically in women. Observational studies using data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition cohort reported that older postmenopausal TZD users experience bone loss at the rate of -0.61% annually compared with non-TZD users. Improvement of bone safety of TZD-based therapy may be achieved by using combination therapy with other anti-diabetic therapies, or preventing bone loss by using available anti-osteoporotic drugs, or development of a new class of selective TZDs, which may have sparing or even beneficial effects on skeleton. Women beware of Actos, bladder cancer, and bone fractures. One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs. Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. In just a matter of a few months, these changes were measured indirectly with bone turnover markers in women. Their markers for building-bone osteoblasts were decreased while markers of bone breakdown were normal. This finding is based on lab mice, but further research in this important area is underway.In a reanalysis of data from a Fosamax trial, it was determined that postmenopausal diabetic women tended to not gain as much bone density as nondiabetics taking Fosamax.Also of note, the diabetics in the placebo group lost bone more rapidly at the hip.Research is needed to guide the design of strategies for improving diabetics' bone health. TZDs generally decrease triglycerides and increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Although the increase in LDL-C may be more focused on the larger LDL particles, which may be less atherogenic, the clinical significance of this is currently unknown. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?However, the study period for the clinical trials using TZD drugs was short—four years or less. **MEN, TOO?The female subjects were in their midfifties and had been diagnosed with diabetes for two years or less. Fractures are now listed on the Avandia prescribing information under _Warnings and Precautions:_ \"Increased incidence of bone fracture in female patients.\" **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients.

This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. SCENIHR study and report\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:\nUltraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. The inner-ear condition Ménière's disease can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of vertigo are recommended to not use fluorescent lights. Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleaned up. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer. Other conditions associated with fluorescent light\nIn rare cases individuals with solar urticaria (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light. One paper suggested that in rare cases, fluorescent lighting can also induce depersonalization and derealization; subsequently, it can worsen depersonalization disorder symptoms. The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines, and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer. Other conditions associated with fluorescent light\nIn rare cases individuals with solar urticaria (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light.

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 50 or 60 Hz. This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). Ultraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed.

Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps.

Flicker effects\nNew lighting systems have not used magnetic ballasts since the turn of the century, however some older installations still remain. Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120 Hz (twice of the utility frequency; the lamp is lit on both the positive and negative half-wave of a cycle).

Generally, preteens receive HPV vaccine at the same time as whooping cough and meningitis vaccines. CDC encourages clinicians to begin implementing the 2-dose schedule in their practice to protect their preteen patients from HPV cancers. Invasive pneumococcal disease is as scary as it sounds. Invasive pneumococcal disease can put your child’s life at risk. If invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) sounds scary, that’s because it is. It’s a group of illnesses caused by bacteria called pneumococcus bacteria. Invasive pneumococcal disease can include meningitis that may lead to brain damage or even death. Invasive pneumococcal disease can spread through a cough. Includes invasive disease caused by Haemophilus influenzae nonserotype b and unknown serotype. In fact, vaccines have helped make widespread epidemics — smallpox, polio, diphtheria, measles, rubella, and mumps — feel like a distant memory. Vaccines help prevent disease while antibiotics are usually only given to children after they become ill. This is especially concerning for invasive pneumococcal disease, since its germs have often developed a resistance to certain antibiotics. Like some vaccines, it’s administered in 4 doses. Sticking to this schedule and getting all 4 doses is important. If your baby receives fewer than 4 doses, his or her immune response may be lower during a time of greater risk. Stick to the CDC-recommended dosing schedule — vaccinate your baby at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age — to ensure your baby’s defense against invasive pneumococcal disease is the strongest it can be. PREVNAR 13® is recommended by doctors at the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). If you are the parent or guardian of a child who had pneumococcal disease before the age of 2 (such as pneumococcal meningitis or blood infection), or if you yourself had pneumococcal disease as a child before the age of 2, Pfizer would like to hear from you. Here are the common ones that some children have experienced with PREVNAR 13®. The most commonly reported serious adverse events in infants and toddlers were bronchiolitis (inflammation of the lungs) (0.9%), gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) (0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%). Please see additional side effects and Important Safety Information. Also, there’s a Doctor Discussion Guide that you can download and bring to your visit. CDC-recommended vaccines for your child, like PREVNAR 13®, are considered a preventative service and may be available at no charge. While there is no charge for the vaccines, there may be other costs. 4 doses of PREVNAR 13®, given on schedule, offer protection from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Invasive pneumococcal disease can include meningitis that may lead to brain damage or even death. Sticking to this schedule and getting all 4 doses is important. If your child receives fewer than 4 doses, his or her immune response may be lower during a time of greater risk. Vaccinate on time. Follow the CDC-recommended immunization schedule. The recommended schedule is designed to protect your baby by providing immunity early in life, before they are exposed to life-threatening diseases. Because of routine immunization, the rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (and the risks they posed to the lives of young children) have been dramatically reduced in the United States and in many other parts of the world. § As recommended by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). † The recommended time between doses is 4-8 weeks apart. Well-child visits are key opportunities to discuss the health and development of your baby, as well as ensure your baby’s vaccination schedule is up to date. A study issued in 2002 by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens on account of tobacco smoke as active smokers. Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults. Wearing surgical masks by the sick may also prevent illness. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. In children less than 6 months of age, exclusive breast feeding reduces both the risk and severity of disease. In people with HIV/AIDS and a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/uL the antibiotic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole decreases the risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia and is \n\nProf. Dr. Jyotsna Joshi asserts the importance of preventive adult vaccinations, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination and also throws light on the schedule for dual vaccination. Physicians treating adult patients have poor awareness of preventive vaccinations. Nevertheless, vaccination is an important aspect of management of respiratory disorders and reduces morbidity and mortality. Adult Respiratory Vaccination, particularly pneumococcal and influenza vaccination is very important and physicians need to be aware of these. Vaccination is an important intervention in the preventive strategy, but in the adult population, it is a much neglected subject. This article emphasises the adult respiratory vaccinations, that are given to prevent respiratory diseases or exacerbations of chronic respiratory disease. The two main vaccinations in this group consist of pneumococcal and Influenza vaccines. The recommendations are largely based on Advisory Committee on Vaccination Practices (ACIP) of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Pneumococcal infections, including pneumonia and invasive disease such as bacteraemia and meningitis, are important sources of morbidity and mortality in infants and young children, older adults (≥65 years of age), and persons with conditions that affect their ability to make antibodies to capsular polysaccharides. Patients with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with conditions such as heart failure are more likely to have adverse outcomes if pneumonia occurs. Asplenia greatly increases the risk for overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, and a cerebrospinal fluid leak or a cochlear implant greatly increases the risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are approved for use. PPSV is used in selected adults and children ≥2 years of age but not in infants or toddlers <2 years of age since polysaccharide antigens are poorly immunogenic in this age group. The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been recommended for many years in for all adults ≥65 years of age and in younger patients who have a condition that increases the risk for developing pneumococcal pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease and/or fatal complications if such infections occur. HIV infection), a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a cochlear implant, or advanced kidney disease. When possible, PCV13 should be given first, followed by PPSV23; the recommended interval between the vaccines varies by patient group. Even if they have not been diagnosed with one of the conditions listed above, they have proven themselves to be susceptible and, therefore, worthy of receiving the vaccine. The CDC recommends 2 pneumococcal vaccines for all adults 65 years or older irrespective of disease or immune status. Administration: Both pneumococcal vaccines are administered as a 0.5 ml dose. PPSV23 is administered intramuscularly (but subcutaneous deposition is adequate in obese patients). Intradermal administration can cause severe local reactions and should be avoided. Administration with other vaccines: Either formulation of pneumococcal vaccine may be given concomitantly with other vaccines. When more than one vaccine is given, they should be administered with different syringes and at different injection sites. Concurrent administration of either PPSV23 or PCV13 with the inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and is unlikely to reduce the effectiveness of either pneumococcal vaccine.In patients who require both PPSV23 and PCV13, the two vaccines should be given at different times as outlined above. ACIP recommends a subsequent revaccination dose of PPSV23 once an immunocompromised patient reaches age 65 but not at regular intervals thereafter. This recommendation is in accord with some European public health agency recommendations. Revaccination with PCV13 is not recommended for any age group. Since 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and their Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) have recommended routine annual influenza vaccination for all persons without contraindications aged 6 months or older. While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. CDC estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Adults with certain health conditions including heart disease, asthma, COPD, diabetes, a liver or kidney disorder, or a weakened immune system are at especially high-risk for influenza and its complications. Trivalent vaccines include an influenza A (H1N1) virus, an influenza A (H3N2) virus, and one influenza B virus. Dose (volume): 0.5 mL for children and adults 6 months of age and older.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

University of Pennsylvania researcher Greg Smith calculated that around a fifth of schizophrenia cases may be attributable toT. More recently, studies have linked T. gondii infection to schizophrenia, and some have found that antipsychotic medication may even stop the parasite from replicating. But such research has been met with much criticism. Smith wanted to determine the proportion of schizophrenia cases that could be attributable to T.gondii infection. Smith calculated the PAF fraction throughout an average lifetime to be 21.4%, meaning that a fifth of all schizophrenia cases over a lifetime could be prevented by stopping T. gondiiinfections from occurring. He notes that many countries have a much higher prevalence of T. gondii infections than the US, and such countries also have a higher prevalence of schizophrenia. A new randomized trial from Taiwan shows that a common food preservative could enhance the effect of a schizophrenia drug, even in the case of people normally resistant to treatment. Studies have shown that “one fifth to one half of [people with schizophrenia] are classified as refractory to pharmacological treatment,” meaning that they do not respond to antipsychotics. Researchers from China Medical University in Taiwan may now have found a way of boosting the effectiveness of certain drugs, which may help some people living with schizophrenia to respond better to treatment. Dr. Lane and team conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showing that this preservative could enhance the effects of the antipsychotic drug clozapine. The new trial seems to confirm for the first time that sodium benzoate — which has successfully been used as an add-on to other antipsychotics — can be added to clozapine to improve the symptoms of drug-resistant patients. Dr. Lane and colleagues’ findings were recently published in the journal Biological Psychiatry. “If the finding can be confirmed, this approach may bring hope for treating patients with the most refractory schizophrenia,” he suggests. schizophrenia without side effect or safety concern.

Two studies published in the journals Schizophrenia Research and Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica attribute this association to Toxoplasma gondii – a parasite found in the intestines of cats. Research has revealed that the parasite is found in brain tissue, and it has been linked to a number of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior. Researchers from the University of Chicago, led by Dr. Emil Coccaro, have been looking for more effective ways to diagnose and treat IED and impulsive aggression. This is a scanning electron micrograph of the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, tissue cyst in brain of an infected mouse. The findings are published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry on March 23, 2016. “Our work suggests that latent infection with the toxoplasma gondiiparasite may change brain chemistry in a fashion that increases the risk of aggressive behavior,” said senior study author Emil Coccaro, MD, Ellen. “However, we do not know if this relationship is causal, and not everyone that tests positive for toxoplasmosis will have aggression issues,” Coccaro said, adding that additional studies are needed. As part of their pioneering research to improve diagnosis and treatment for IED and impulsive aggression, Coccaro and his colleagues examined possible connections to toxoplasmosis, an extremely common parasitic infection. However, it is known to reside in brain tissue, and has been linked to several psychiatric diseases, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior. One third were healthy controls with no psychiatric history. This last group served as a control to distinguish IED from possible confounding psychiatric factors. The research team found that IED-diagnosed group was more than twice as likely\n\nThe diagnosis of schizophrenia, a psychotic disorder, is based on criteria in either the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Clinical assessment of schizophrenia is carried out by a mental health professional based on observed behavior, reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. Diagnosis is usually made by a psychiatrist. Only two symptoms are required for a diagnosis of schizophrenia, resulting in different presentations for the same disorder. The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms First-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms: DSM-5 The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes: Subtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood.

The ICD-10, on the other hand, puts more emphasis on first-rank symptoms. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom. First rank symptoms First-rank symptoms are psychotic symptoms that are particularly characteristic of schizophrenia, which were put forward by Kurt Schneider in 1959. Their reliability for the diagnosis of schizophrenia has been questioned since then. A 2015 systematic review investigated the diagnostic accuracy of first rank symptoms: DSM-5 The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially the same as that specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes: Subtype classifications were removed. Catatonia is no longer so strongly associated with schizophrenia. Special treatment of Schneider's first-rank symptoms is no longer recommended. The ICD-10 defines seven sub-classifications of schizophrenia. The Russian version of the ICD-10 includes additional four sub-classifications of schizophrenia: hypochondriacal (F20.801), cenesthopathic (F20.802), childhood type (F20.803), and atypical (F20.804). Comorbidities People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance. An estimated 21% to 47% of patients with schizophrenia have a substance misuse disorder at some time in their life, and the chances of developing a substance misuse disorder is significantly higher among patients suffering from a psychotic illness. It is estimated that 15% of the population with schizophrenia are late-onset and 5% very-late onset. Many of the symptoms of late-onset schizophrenia are similar to the early-onset. On the other hand, late-onset cases are less likely to present with formal thought disorder, affective symptoms. Etiology The pathophysiology of schizophrenia is poorly understood. Multiple genetic and environment factors have been associated with increased risk for developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, response to treatment with anti-psychotic medication is variable, with some patients being resistant to some therapies. Together, the differences in causes, response to treatment and pathophysiology suggest schizophrenia is heterogeneous from an etiological standpoint. The differences resulting from this in terms of in clinical manifestations make the disorder harder to diagnose. Distinct symptomatic sub types of schizophrenia groups show distinct patterns of SNP variations, reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the disease. Studies also suggest there is a genetic overlap between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder. These factors complicate the use of genetic tests in diagnosis or prediction of the onset of schizophrenia. Etiological factors of Schizophrenia is at the forefront of current research efforts. For example, children who are exposed to the Rubella virus in utero are 20% more likely to be diagnosed with Schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Children who are exposed to the parasite Toxoplasma Gondii are two times more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and the diagnosis can be predicted as early as one week of life among newborns. Although mothers may not have experienced symptoms of Rubella or Toxoplasma Gondii, higher levels of antibodies associated with these infections during pregnancy is associated to a higher probability that their child will have schizophrenia. When these cells become inflamed, they produce nitric oxide and amino acids, contributing to neuronal death. The hypothesis states that these alterations in functioning may contribute to the onset of Schizophrenia later in adulthood. \"The ultimate goal is to develop a strategy in which a simple brain scan could provide the necessary information to help select the best medication -- or treatment approach -- for an individual patient,\" said study co-author Dr. Anil Malhotra, director of psychiatry research at the Zucker Hillside Hospital in New York City. While there's a perception that people with schizophrenia have multiple personalities, that's not the case. \"We have no way to predict how an individual patient with schizophrenia is going to respond to treatment,\" Malhotra said. \"Essentially, we use a trial-and-error approach to treatment choices.\" Patients may remain psychotic, leading to more costs and devastating consequences such as suicide. In the new study, Malhotra and colleagues at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y., used functional-MRI brain scans to develop a measurement of how well two regions of the brain communicate with each other. The researchers tried out the strategy on a group of 41 patients, aged 15 to 40, experiencing their first \"psychotic break.\" Using information gained from that trial, the researchers tested their technique in 40 patients hospitalized for psychotic illness. Seventy-six percent of the time, the investigators successfully predicted the response of the second group of patients to drug treatments. \"We were close to these goals with the current work and are now looking to launch additional research in this area to hopefully increase this signal to those levels,\" said Malhotra.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen. Pharmacokinetics The therapeutic recommended dosages were 12.5, 25, and 50 mg with an approximate bioavailability of 93%.

Heart and blood vessels VIGOR study and publishing controversy The VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, conducted by Bombardier, et al., compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of a supra-therapeutic dose of rofecoxib (50 mg/day) vs. a common dose of naproxen (500 mg/BID), had indicated a significant 4-fold increased risk of acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in rofecoxib patients when compared with naproxen patients (0.4% vs 0.1%, RR 0.25) over a mean duration of 9-months. The elevated risk began during the second month on rofecoxib. There was no significant difference in the mortality from cardiovascular events between the two groups, nor was there any significant difference in the rate of myocardial infarction between the rofecoxib and naproxen treatment groups in patients without high cardiovascular risk. The difference in overall risk was by the patients at higher risk of heart attack, i.e. Merck's scientists interpreted the finding as a protective effect of naproxen, telling the FDA that the difference in heart attacks \"is primarily due to\" this protective effect. The Martin Report excused senior management by stating they believed they were victims of Pfizer's alleged manipulation of test results to promote their product as a safer alternative. Some commentators have noted that naproxen would have to be three times as effective as aspirin to account for all of the difference, and some outside scientists warned Merck that this claim was implausible before VIGOR was published. No evidence has since emerged for such a large cardioprotective effect of naproxen, although a number of studies have found protective effects similar in size to those of aspirin. The results of the VIGOR study were submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2001. In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold. All the additional heart attacks occurred in the group at low risk of heart attack (the \"aspirin not indicated\" group) and the editors noted that the omission \"resulted in the misleading conclusion that there was a difference in the risk of myocardial\n\nRofecoxib is a COX-2 selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).

In September 2001, the FDA sent a warning letter to the CEO of Merck, stating, \"Your promotional campaign discounts the fact that in the VIGOR study, patients on Vioxx were observed to have a four to five fold increase in myocardial infarctions (MIs) compared to patients on the comparator non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), Naprosyn (naproxen).\" This led to the introduction, in April 2002, of warnings on Vioxx labeling concerning the increased risk of cardiovascular events (heart attack and stroke). The editors charged that \"more than four months before the article was published, at least two of its authors were aware of critical data on an array of adverse cardiovascular events that were not included in the VIGOR article.\" These additional data included three additional heart attacks, and raised the relative risk of Vioxx from 4.25-fold to 5-fold.

It was marketed by Merck & Co. to treat osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, acute pain conditions, migraine, and dysmenorrhea. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. In September 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. It is the largest cause of morbidity in patients with hemophilia and has no currently approved treatment options in the United States. Traditional NSAIDs are avoided in this population due to their effects on platelet aggregation and risk of gastrointestinal ulcers, and high potency opioids are the current standard of care in treating HA. This was largely based on the VIGOR (Vioxx GI Outcomes Research) study, which compared the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of rofecoxib and naproxen.

New strategies may be able to prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia among older adults, according to background information in the article. Accurate methods of identifying which people are at high risk for dementia in old age would help physicians determine who could benefit from these interventions. However, previous research has not addressed whether measuring atrophy using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can predict the onset of AD at an earlier stage, before cognitive symptoms appear. Tom den Heijer, M.D., Ph.D., of the Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues used MRI to assess the brain volumes of 511 dementia-free elderly people who were part of the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based cohort study that began in 1990. They screened the participants for dementia at initial visits in 1995 and 1996 and then in follow-up visits between 1997 and 2003, during which they asked about memory problems and performed extensive neuropsychological testing. The authors also monitored the medical records of all participants. During the follow-up, 35 participants developed dementia and 26 were diagnosed with AD. People with severe amygdalar or hippocampal atrophy had the highest risk of developing dementia or AD over the course of the study, which followed participants for an average period of six years. \"Concerning the extent of atrophy, we found in those destined to develop dementia volume reductions between 17 percent and 5 percent, depending on how long before the diagnosis of dementia the MRI was conducted,\" the authors report. \"In persons with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease, volume reductions compared with healthy elderly persons are between 25 percent and 40 percent, suggesting that atrophy rates accelerate in patients with Alzheimer disease.\" \"Our study suggests that structural brain imaging can help identify people at high risk for developing dementia, even before they have any memory complaints or measurable cognitive impairment,\" they write. \"However, we must bear in mind that most people with atrophy did not develop dementia, even after six years. Further prospective population studies are therefore required to find additional biomarkers, including other brain imaging parameters, that alone or in combination with clinical and genetic characteristics can help separate those who are at risk for developing dementia from those who are not.\" \"Reduced Brain Volume May Predict Dementia In Healthy Elderly People.\" She is a specialist in neurodegenerative diseases.

Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age. Past cases In the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\" Life support complications Throughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\" Treating these complications is difficult since the effects of medication on the fetus's health are unknown. Fetus's chance of survival According to Esmaelilzadeh, et al., \"[a]t present, it seems that there is no clear lower limit to the gestational age which would restrict the physician's efforts to support the brain dead mother and her fetus.\" However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into preterm births indicates that \"a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival. Brain death vs. similar conditions It is important to understand the similarities and differences between brain death and two other conditions: persistent vegetative state and coma. Difference between brain death and persistent vegetative state Patients in a persistent vegetative state \"are alive but also have severely impaired consciousness, although their eyes may open spontaneously. These patients do not acknowledge the examiner; they do not attend or track objects that are presented to them; their movements are non-purposeful; they do not speak.\" The difference between the two states is that brain death means \"death of the brainstem\" which can be clinically diagnosed and vegetative state means \"permanent and total loss of forebrain function\" which needs further investigation. Difference between brain death and coma People in comas have \"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state. U.S.A. Federal and state laws Several laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. This recent situation involving Marlise Muñoz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives. Cost of care The cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days). The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983. The death of Marlise Muñoz at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, TX was the most recently publicized instance of somatic support of a brain dead pregnant woman from 2013-2014. and Loewy propose the following rubric when determining whether or not to offer life support to a pregnant, brain dead woman: If the fetus suffers from the event as the mother suffers, life support should not be provided. For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and\n\n Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus. When deliberate steps are taken to end a pregnancy, it is called an induced abortion, or less frequently \"induced miscarriage\". When properly done, abortion is one of the safest procedures in medicine, but unsafe abortion is a major cause of maternal death, especially in the developing world, while making safe abortion legal and accessible reduces maternal deaths. The group covered the cases of Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl placed on a ventilator following complications from tonsil and nasal surgery, and Marlise Munoz, a young mother declared brain dead but kept on life support for two months for the sake of her 14-week-old fetus. Popik cited a study by the American Academy of Neurology that indicated, while the protocol for declaring brain death varies widely from state to state and hospital to hospital, an average hospital determines brain death as many as 50 times a year. Brain death is the total and irreversible cessation of the entire brain, including the brain stem, and is determined by a complete examination using a set of diagnostic criteria and not by a single test, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG) or an electroencephalogram (EEG), White explained. “The science of brain death is very good. The concept of brain death is well-founded scientifically,” he said. Jahi McMath was declared brain dead on Dec. 12, 2013, after three neurologists confirmed she was unable to breathe on her own, had no blood flow to her brain, and showed no sign of electrical activity in the brain. When McMath’s family refused to remove the ventilator, a legal agreement was eventually forced requiring that a death certificate be issued by the Alameda County, Calif., coroner’s office before the patient was moved to an undisclosed facility where life support continues. White said families sometimes have trouble accepting a doctor’s verdict because a patient on life support has a heartbeat, breathes and feels warm to the touch. Wilde added that the issue is compounded in today’s society because death is often not discussed. Lemke agreed, saying families used to care for patients in their final days at home and watched their loved ones struggle for longer periods of time. “We’re isolated and insulated from the reality of death, so when death comes it is all-the-more shocking and we are all-the-more ill-prepared for it,” Lemke said. A judge ruled in his favor on Jan. 24, 2014, stating that the fetus was abnormal and not viable, and that women had a right to end pregnancies if they wished. While the law seeks to balance the rights of individuals, Popik argued the mother’s rights were extinguished when she was pronounced brain dead. According to a Jan. 28, 2014 NPR article reporting on the case, the authors of the bill “intended to keep a pregnant woman who was in a persistent vegetative state on a ventilator until she could deliver, but not a dead pregnant woman,” and insisted the hospital had misinterpreted the law. While the Munoz case was in the news earlier this year, a similar story previously unfolded in Canada. Robyn Benson of British Columbia was declared brain dead at 22 weeks into her pregnancy. Life support continued and her healthy but premature son was delivered at 27 weeks. Benson died the next day. Analysts of the Munoz and Benson cases point out that the hospital had declared the Munoz fetus not viable, while the Benson fetus was determined to be normal. Allowing organ donation is a separate issue but should be expressed in an advanced directive.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

On 7 May, the government acknowledged\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey is part of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home from a trip to Europe. Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Timeline January 2020 On 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 On 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations Turkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue On 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases.

While their effectiveness varies from year to year, most provide modest to high protection against influenza. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that vaccination against influenza reduces sickness, medical visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also recommends yearly vaccination of high risk groups. The vaccines are generally safe; fever occurs in five to ten percent of children vaccinated, and temporary muscle pains or feelings of tiredness may occur. In certain years, the vaccine was linked to an increase in Guillain–Barré syndrome among older people at a rate of about one case per million doses. Although most influenza vaccines are produced using egg proteins, they are still recommended as safe for people who have severe egg allergies, as no increased risk of allergic reaction to the egg-based vaccines has been shown for people with egg allergies. Influenza vaccines are not recommended in those who have had a severe allergy to previous versions of the vaccine itself. The vaccine comes in inactive and weakened viral forms. The intradermal vaccine was not available during the 2018–2019 and 2019–2020 influenza seasons. History Vaccines are used in both humans and nonhumans. Only one therapeutic measure, transfusing blood from recovered patients to new victims, showed any hint of success.\" The vaccination program was rushed, yet plagued by delays and public relations problems. The program was canceled after about 24% of the population had received vaccinations. An excess in deaths of twenty-five over normal annual levels as well as four hundred excess hospitalizations, both from Guillain–Barré syndrome, were estimated to have occurred from the vaccination program itself, demonstrating that the vaccine itself is not free of risks. The result can be cited to support lingering doubts about vaccination as well as to counter ungrounded claims about the safety of vaccination. In the end, however, even the maligned 1976 vaccine may have saved lives. A 2010 study found a significantly enhanced immune response against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 in study participants who had received vaccination against the swine flu in 1976. In the 2019–2020 influenza season all regular-dose flu shots and all recombinant influenza vaccine in the United States are quadrivalent. Medical uses The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the flu vaccine as the best way to protect people against the flu and prevent its spread. The influenza vaccine also appears to protect against myocardial infarction with a benefit of 15 to 45%. In the case of influenza, effectiveness is expected to be lower than the efficacy because it is measured using the rates of influenza-like illness, which is not always caused by influenza. However, studies on the effectiveness of flu vaccines in the real world are difficult; vaccines may be imperfectly matched, virus prevalence varies widely between years, and influenza is often confused with other influenza-like illnesses. The virus rapidly changes due to antigenic drift, a slight mutation in the virus that causes a new strain to arise. Repeated annual influenza vaccination generally offer consistent year-on-year protection against influenza. There is, however, suggestive evidence that repeated vaccinations may cause a reduction in vaccine effectiveness for certain influenza subtypes; this has no relevance to current recommendations for yearly vaccinations but might influence future vaccination policy. Research demonstrates patients infected with the two viruses are over twice as likely to die as patients with only COVID-19. Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely receive an influenza vaccine. An influenza vaccine and a COVID-19 vaccine may be given safely at the same time. High-risk populations, including the elderly and those with chronic disease, often acquire only limited immunity towards the flu from vaccines. The Washington University School of Medicine in St.Louis and the Icahn School of Medicine in Mount Sinai in New York are using the glycoprotein neuraminidase as a targeted antigen in their research. Three monoclonal antibodies (mAB) were sampled from a patient infected with influenza A H3N2 virus.

Could one of them cause the next pandemic? Two established examples are rabies and bubonic plague, both of which can be deadly for humans. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) originated in chimpanzees or gorillas, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by an avian coronavirus, and the 2009 swine flu pandemic came from – well, you can guess. Ebola virus, for example, was passed from apes to humans, presumably by the consumption of ‘bush meat’: wild animals such as fruit bats or monkeys that are hunted for food. Any virus or bacterium that infects our primate relatives could also be dangerous to us. To identify new infectious agents that jump the species barrier, therefore, the German researchers teamed up with behavioural scientists in Ivory Coast, West Africa, to study the great apes. They collaborate as part of the Great Ape Health Monitoring Unitw2, an institute that provides space to researchers from around the world who want to obtain samples from wild apes. Whenever one of the apes that they are studying becomes ill or dies, the team collects blood, faeces and urine samples to send to Fabian and his group in Berlin. If the ape dies, it is autopsied on-site by one of the veterinarians. Does the newly discovered microbe infect only apes or can it be transmitted to humans? Could they pass the disease on to other humans? If the pathogen proves to be dangerous, the health authorities are notified and take charge of emergency measures. Sick people are quarantined, doctors and nurses are called to the outbreak zone, and bush markets and public transport may be shut down temporarily. “We carry a mobile miniature lab with which we can instantly test for the most dangerous species, like Ebola virus,” explains Fabian. The research strategy has proved successful: in recent years, the group discovered why wild chimpanzees had started dying of anthrax (Leendertz et al., 2004). Fabian and his colleagues found that a previously harmless soil bacterium (Bacillus cereus) had acquired – from a related pathogenic bacterium (Bacillus anthracis) – the genetic information to produce the dangerous anthrax toxin. The bacterial strain that evolved from this genetic transfer (Bacillus cereus anthracis) can live in the soil and is highly virulent, thus posing a lethal threat to chimpanzees. Why are zootonic infectious so dangerous? How may environmental changes cause more zootonic infections in the near future? What could governments do to prevent new pandemics? What tests allow scientists to determine if an individual has been infected by a zoonosis? How should authorities manage an emergency of a pandemic caused by zoonosis? This article could also be used to stimulate discussions about the history of infectious diseases; the interactions of organisms with their environment; and recent food security scandals. As expected, monkeys and great ape species such as orangutans can also be infected with the COVID-19 virus. Multiple countries have identified infected animals in mink farms. A vaccine for mink and other animals is being researched. Beatrice Hahn of the University of Pennsylvania and a team of researchers in 2009 found that chimpanzees do die from simian AIDS in the wild and that the AIDS outbreak in Africa has contributed to the decline of chimpanzee populations. Testing wild chimpanzees, researchers detected organ and tissue damage similar to late-stage human AIDS. The infected chimpanzees had a 10 to 16 times greater risk of dying than uninfected ones; infected females were less likely to give birth, could pass the virus to their infants, and had a higher infant mortality rate than uninfected females. African green monkeys (also called vervets, genus Chlorocebus) in African populations are heavily infected with SIVagm, while the virus is absent in the founder isolate \n\n\"In order to cause a pandemic, H5N1 viruses will have to acquire the ability to transmit efficiently from person to person. The H5 hemagglutinin (HA) is found in influenza viruses that typically infect avian species, so efficient person-to-person spread could happen if the H5N1 virus reassorts, or exchanges genes, with circulating human influenza viruses giving rise to a virus with the H5 HA (to which the population is not immune) in a gene constellation that confers the property of transmissibility. Alternatively, efficient person-to-person spread could occur if the H5N1 virus evolves and adapts to more efficient replication and transmissibility in the human population.\" H5N1 may cause \n\nAnthrax, a disease so far not associated with tropical rain forests, is common in the Ivory Coast's Taï National Park and is posing a serious threat to wildlife there. This is revealed in a study by scientists from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, the University of Glasgow, and the Ivorian National Animal Health Institute. In 2004, Leendertz' team at RKI discovered a previously unknown type of the anthrax bacterium in dead chimpanzees in the rainforests of Taï National Park: Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis. Studies conducted since have shown that the same type has also caused mortality in isolated cases in chimpanzees, gorillas, and elephants in Cameroon and the Central African Republic. \"To our surprise, almost 40 percent of all animal deaths in Taï National Park we investigated were attributable to anthrax,\" reports Emmanuel Couacy-Hymann from the Ivorian Animal Health Institute. The researchers found the pathogen in several monkey species, duikers, mongoose, and a porcupine. Most seriously affected were the chimpanzees: 31 of the 55 individuals whose carcasses were examined had died from the disease. In addition, the researchers are searching for ways to protect the chimpanzees, including the possibility of vaccination.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These definitions were provided to us from the North Carolina Center for Hospital Quality and Patient Safety, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and from a toolkit used by the Michigan Health and Hospital Association written by Mohamad G. Fakih, MD, MPH, Sanjay Saint, MD, MPH, Sarah Krein, RN, PhD., and Russ Olmsted, MPH, CIC. Given the important clinical and economic consequences of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), researchers across the world have attempted various methods to prevent this common, costly, and morbid patient safety problem. In this section, we summarize the evidence supporting the use of several practices to prevent CAUTI. Fortunately, members of our Ann Arbor VA Medical Center/University of Michigan Patient Safety Research group have been involved in the development of most of these guidelines. Do not use the indwelling catheter unless you must! Urinary tract infection represents almost 40% of all healthcare-associated infections, with the vast majority due to the indwelling urinary catheter. Over 900,000 patients develop a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in a U.S. hospital each year. Urinary catheter-related infection leads to substantial morbidity. The incidence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients is about 5% per day. The presentation of catheter-associated infection varies from asymptomatic bacteriuria to overwhelming sepsis and even death. Patients with bloodstream infection may present with fever, confusion, and hypotension. A key first step leading to CAUTI is the colonization of the catheter with organisms. Many of the infectious complications of the urinary catheter could be prevented by using the catheter only when necessary and promptly removing it when no longer needed. Over five decades ago, the late Dr. Paul Beeson persuasively argued against the routine use of indwelling urinary catheters in hospitalized patients. While these devices provide important benefits in some patients, they are also the primary risk factor for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Indwelling urinary catheters, however, also lead to significant non-infectious complications. Urinary catheters cause patient discomfort. In one prospective study, for example, 42% of catheterized patients report the indwelling catheter was uncomfortable, 48% complained that it was painful, and 61% noted that it restricted their activities of daily living. Thus, for some patients urinary catheters operate as a physical restraint, tantamount to binding them to the bed, substantially and unnecessarily limiting their ability to function freely and with dignity. Restricted activity not only reduces patient autonomy, it also promotes other patient safety problems, such as venous thromboembolism, deconditioning, and pressure ulcers. In short, there are compelling reasons to limit indwelling urinary catheterization because of both non-infectious and infectious complications. The Ann Arbor Criteria are an updated set of recommendations that define when use of an indwelling urinary catheter is appropriate for hospitalized medical patients. Aseptic technique is strongly recommended during the insertion of indwelling urinary catheters, based on biologic principles, the pathogenesis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms. A recent analysis of patient safety practices by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality emphasized the important role of nurses in preventing CAUTI, the most common healthcare-associated infection. While physicians and medical students occasionally insert indwelling urinary catheters, nurses are generally responsible for the insertion and maintenance of urinary catheters; unlicensed personnel may also insert indwelling catheters under the direction of registered nurses. As part of their nursing education, student nurses are taught catheter insertion practices through simulation and clinical experiences. Anecdotal evidence – coupled with preliminary observations done by the University of Michigan CAUTI research group – reveal that proper aseptic technique is not reliably used when indwelling urinary catheters are inserted. The risk of infection increases by 5% for each day that a catheter remains in place, and the length of time that a catheter remains in place is the most important risk factor for the development of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Up to half of patients with an indwelling catheter for 5 days or longer will have bacteria or fungus in their urine. Therefore, once an indwelling urinary catheter is inserted, ongoing vigilance (abstract) is needed to reduce the risks of both infectious and non-infectious complications. Many times physicians are not aware that patients’ urinary catheters are still in place, so we begin this section with assessment strategies to maintain awareness of catheter presence and determine the ongoing need for an indwelling catheter. In this section we also provide evidence-based guidance for catheter care and securement, drainage, transportation with a catheter, and talking points for patients and families related to indwelling urinary catheters. While it is better for the patient not to have an indwelling urinary catheter at all, when catheters are necessary our recommendations in this section will help minimize risks associated with catheter use. Thus, many hours and days can pass before a urinary catheter that is no longer necessary is recognized and removed; by default, urinary catheters usually remain in place until these steps occur. In contrast, using strategies to remind and prompt removal of unnecessary urinary catheters has the potential to bypass several of these steps, and reduce the occurrence of hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections. “Reminders” function simply to remind the clinicians (physician and/or nurse) that a urinary catheter is still being used, and may provide an educational list of reasons to continue or discontinue the urinary catheter. “Stop orders” prompt the clinician to remove the catheter by default after a certain time period or a set of clinical conditions has occurred (such as 24 or 48 hours post-operative) unless the catheter remains clinically appropriate. Stop orders “expire” in the same fashion as restraint or antibiotic orders, unless action is taken by physicians. Stop orders directed at physicians require an order to renew or discontinue on the basis of review at specific time intervals (bypassing steps 1-3). Stop orders directed at nurses will empower nurses to remove the catheter on the basis of a list of indications, without requiring the nurse to obtain a physician-signed order before removing the catheter (bypassing steps 1-4). Using electronic\n\nVA nursing homes serve nearly 50,000 Veterans each year, and urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most commonly reported infection. To help reduce the incidence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in nursing homes, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Safety Program for Long-term Care: HAIs/CAUTI aimed to reduce catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), enhance frontline healthcare professional knowledge about infection prevention, and improve the safety culture in nursing homes. The questionnaire included 30 items about infection prevention, with a specific focus on CAUTI prevention. Most VA nursing home infection prevention programs were integrated within their VA acute care infection prevention programs, and they had more infection prevention related resources. Overall, a lower percentage of VA nursing homes reported having policies concerning appropriate catheter use or catheter insertion compared to non-VA nursing homes. For example, only 64% of VA nursing homes had policies specifying the appropriate indications for catheter use compared with 81% of non-VA nursing homes.

Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology. The exact numbers of individuals with acute prostatitis is unknown, because many do not seek treatment. In the US, at least 1-3 percent of males under the age of 40 develop urinary difficulty as a result of acute prostatitis.

GUIDANCE FOR CONTROL OF INFECTIONS WITH CARBAPENEM-RESISTANT OR CARBAPENEMASE-PRODUCING ENTEROBACTERIACEAL IN ACUTE CARE FACILITITES 2009: CDC and HICPAC have developed new guidance for CRE infection prevention and control in an effort to limit the further emergence of these organisms. The culprit, according to a study published in the American Journal of Infection Control, is nurse burnout and has been linked to higher rates of hospital-acquired infections (HAIs). These problems affect nurses both personally and professionally, and it may affect their patients as well. It then compared a hospital’s percentage of burnout nurses to its rates of catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs). Dr. Wagner reminds nurses that there are simple steps they can take to help reduce the incidence of HAIs. Other preventive measures bring a nurse’s role as patient advocate into play. Dr. Wagner encourages nurses to check online resources that recommend nursing interventions for preventing common types of HAIs. The CDC’s latest recommendations are compiled in the 2009 Guideline for Prevention of CAUTIs and in the Guideline for Prevention of Surgical Site Infection, 1999.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Dubbed the silent killer due to its asymptomatic nature, high blood pressure damages blood vessels over time. Luckily, there are several things that a person can do to lower their blood pressure. How does e-counseling affect hypertension? Nolan and his team explain that using the Internet in search of health tips is \"the third most popular online activity,\" with 72 percent of users engaging in it. New research shows that this dairy product, rich in probiotic properties, lowers blood pressure in rodents. The other group only received generic emails with information about blood pressure management. \"It's automated, but it's also interactive,\" he goes on, also stressing the importance of actively engaging the patients to improve their health. \"The interactive tools help people self-assess their changes in blood pressure or lifestyle behavior, which is very important. In fact, our current healthcare system and reimbursement protocols frame it as such. However, a recent study on high blood pressure took place in a barbershop, and researchers wanted to learn more about patient compliance to medical recommendations and medications. Why Study High Blood Pressure in a Barbershop? Researchers chose to conduct a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop because it was a familiar setting within the participants’ community. They also trained barbers, who were considered as trusted advisors, to measure blood pressure and council participants on hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were screened for high blood pressure by their barber and then referred to meet with a pharmacist who was in the barbershop. The pharmacist provided medication and education for lifestyle modifications. The control group received education from their barber on lifestyle modifications. Researchers concluded that the location of this study and its convenience impacted patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Additionally, the intervention group did not have to go to another location to receive help from the pharmacists, as they were immediately available in the barbershop. While not a physician, the barber was viewed by all participants as a reliable member of the community. Therefore, the experiment suggests that patients must trust the individual delivering healthcare recommendations. The barbershop study demonstrates that to improve care on a larger scale, fewer restrictions should be placed on the type of qualified provider and setting of treatment. PreviousWhat Is Phlebotomy And Why Is It Convenient to Have In Your Primary Care Doctor’s Office? The purpose of the $8.5 million grant awarded to the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute physician is to support a new, randomized, controlled clinical trial aimed at enlisting African-American barbers in the fight against hypertension. The physician, Ronald G. Victor, MD, conducted a previous study that showed offering blood pressure checks during men's haircuts and encouraging patrons with hypertension to follow up with physicians could save hundreds of lives annually. Now, with the grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Dr. Victor will conduct a new trial with 500 African-American male patrons of 20 Los Angeles-area barbershops. The goal of this trial is to test the effectiveness of barbershop hypertension programs and evaluate whether expanding such programs is feasible and cost-effective. Conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop instead of a traditional clinical setting offers several advantages. Firstly, the familiarity of the barbershop setting within the participants' community can help foster a sense of comfort and trust. In the study mentioned, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide counseling on hypertension. As trusted advisors within the community, barbers played a crucial role in engaging participants and facilitating discussions on healthcare. This approach allowed for easy access to blood pressure screenings and immediate referrals to healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists who were available in the barbershop. The convenience of having healthcare services provided within the barbershop itself eliminates the need for participants to travel to another location for assistance. Moreover, the study highlighted that the interventions in the barbershop setting were associated with increased patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Participants in the intervention group, who received screenings and pharmacist consultations in the barbershop, were more receptive to lifestyle modification recommendations. Overall, conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop setting offers advantages such as enhanced patient engagement, improved accessibility, and increased compliance. Los Angeles, CA (BlackNews.com) — Visiting a barbershop in California this Saturday could mean more than getting a haircut. It might be a lifesaver. The Black Barbershop Health Outreach Program, a unique, grassroots approach to health screening and education, will be held at more than 80 barbershops in 23 cities statewide on Saturday, May 22 from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. In hundreds of nearby barbershops, African American men nationwide will receive free screening for diabetes and hypertension, and learn why early detection of prostate cancer can be a life-saving decision. Led by Dr. Bill J. Releford, D.P.M., founder of The Diabetic Amputation Prevention (DAP) Foundation, along with a squadron of volunteers, the outreach program seeks to empower African American men to better understand cardiovascular diseases through education, testing and prevention. Through black-owned barbershops, which represent a cultural institution of familiarity and trust, the outreach program has adopted a novel means to spread health information. Data collected from the California barbershops will be analyzed and processed at Charles Drew University. Since 2007, nearly 400 black-owned barbershops have participated in the program. To learn more about the health outreach effort, and to view a complete list of those barbershops involved, please go to www.BlackBarbershop.org.

It said that if children with low levels of cortisol are exposed to trauma such as sexual abuse, they are six times more likely to develop the condition when older. Contrary to the impression that might be gained from parts of the news report, this study did not assess cortisol levels in childhood, but only in adults with or without CFS. The study was published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Archives of General Psychiatry . The researchers wanted to investigate this by looking at levels of the hormone cortisol in people with and without CFS. Cortisol is involved in the body’s stress response. Of these people, 124 were confirmed as healthy, and acted as controls. All participants had a psychiatric examination, and the researchers excluded anyone who had certain conditions, such as manic depression (bipolar disorder) or psychosis. The participants’ cortisol levels were measured using samples of their saliva taken immediately upon waking in the morning, and 30, 45, and 60 minutes later. The researchers then compared levels of childhood trauma between the cases and controls. The researchers also looked at the relationship between cortisol levels, childhood trauma and CFS. Experiencing childhood trauma increased the risk of CFS by 5.6 times. However, the link between childhood trauma and CFS remained even after adjusting for these symptoms. If the participants were split into those with and without trauma, only those with CFS and childhood trauma had reduced cortisol levels. The researchers conclude that their results “confirm childhood trauma as an important risk factor of CFS”. This may indicate the biological mechanism behind how childhood trauma could affect risk of CFS. They say that their findings “are critical to inform pathophysiological research and to devise targets for the prevention of CFS”. This study only measured cortisol levels in adults who were already known to have or not have CFS. Therefore it cannot indicate whether cortisol levels in childhood owuld be able to predict risk of CFS in later life. Although this study cannot prove that childhood trauma itself “causes” CFS, or that childhood cortisol levels can predict CFS in adulthood, this study contributes to knowledge about potential risk factors for CFS. Much more research is needed to fully understand the causes of this complex condition. Early warning British brain scientists have identified a 'biological signpost' for clinical depression and say it could help identify those are at risk of developing the debilitating mental illness. In a study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) journal, the team found that teenage boys who have a combination of depressive symptoms and raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol are up to 14 times more likely to develop major depression than those who show neither trait. The findings suggest teenagers could in future be screened for such signals, and those at highest risk could be helped to develop the kind of coping strategies and \"brain fitness\" to help them avoid becoming depressive. \"(And) we now have a very real way of identifying those teenage boys most likely to develop clinical depression.\" For their study, Goodyear's team measured levels of cortisol in saliva from two large separate groups of teenagers. The first group of 660 provided samples on four school mornings within a week and then again 12 months later. A second group of 1198 teenagers gave samples over three school mornings. Use these social-bookmarking links to share Biomarker could help boys at risk of major depression. They investigated associations between childhood adversity and child adjustment in 338 5-year-olds. Children with high cortisol reactivity were rated by teachers as least prosocial when living under adverse conditions, but most prosocial when living under more benign conditions (and in comparison to children scoring low on cortisol reactivity). Regarding characteristics of the category of Phenotypic Factors, Pluess and Belsky (2009) reported that the effect of child care quality on teacher-rated socioemotional adjustment varied as a function of infant temperament in the case of 761 4.5-year-olds participating in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network, 2005). and it is hypothesized that it might be caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. Sex Differences Mood disorders, specifically stress-related mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, have been shown to have differing rates of diagnosis based on sex. Underlying these sex differences, studies have shown a dysregulation of stress-responsive neuroendocrine function causing an increase in the likelihood of developing these affective disorders. Overactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis could provide potential insight into how these sex differences arise. Neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is \n\nChild neglect, often overlooked, is the most common form of child maltreatment. Childhood Physical health development Research has shown that by the time a child reaches the age of six, if they have experienced adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), such as neglect, their chances of having overall poor physical health increases by two-fold. Exposure to ACEs, which exert effect by increasing an individual exposure to toxic stress during key periods of development, has also been linked to higher risks of chronic diseases, respiratory and heart disease, cancer and suicide. Further, maltreatment and neglect during infancy has been linked to a variety of physical development issues, including poor growth and insufficient brain and neuronal development. The term \"failure to thrive\" refers to an abnormal pattern of weight gain or weight loss, or experiencing insufficient growth patterns in accordance with a child's age and developmental stage. The most common symptoms of non-organic failure to thrive are insufficient weight gain or growth in height, and these common symptoms can affect a child over his/her life course by setting them back in weight class and can hinder their overall growth. Other symptoms of failure to thrive include symptoms such as anemia, iron deficiency, low insulin, dry/cracked skin, thin hair growth, pasty skin, and more. And in more extreme cases, non-organic failure to thrive can affect a child over their whole life course by actually damaging his/her cognitive development and his/her immune system due to insufficient calorie intake or lack of medical attention, making the child much more likely to miss developmental milestones and much more prone to illness even later into adulthood. Cognitive development Social and emotional development A developing child requires proper nutrition, protection, and regulation for healthy attachment. When posed with problem-solving tasks, neglected children reacted with anger and frustration, and were less enthusiastic with completing a new task. A study examining the motor, language, and cognitive development of neglected children showed that the scores from the Bayley Scales of Infant Development were significantly lower than non-maltreated children. Further, neglected children perform significantly poorer on IQ tests than non-maltreated children. However that risk may be attenuated by the presence of a functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene 5HTTLPR, which can manifest in two different types of alleles, the \"short\" subtype and the \"long\" subtype, carriers of the long/long allele subtype were resistant to developing depression in response to early life trauma. Biological mechanisms Activation of the LHPA axis triggers the hypothalamus to secrete corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), CRH stimulates the release of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) by binding to CRH receptors in the anterior pituitary. While this CRF elevation persists into adulthood; initial elevations of ACTH and cortisol levels become attenuated with chronic exposure to elevated CRH (a.k.a. High CRH in turn causes adaptive down-regulation of pituitary CRH and neural CRF receptors after trauma onset. The long-term consequence of early trauma experiences and elevated CRF resets the regulation of the LHPA axis so that ACTH and cortisol secretions are set at lower 24-hour levels during baseline and non-stressful conditions. Cross-sectional studies show that trauma in infant primates and very young or prepubertal children living in orphanages show low morning and daytime cortisol production, suggesting that prepubertal children may be more sensitive to negative feedback control mechanisms for cortisol output than older school-age children who show higher cortisol levels. Research involving humans has similarly demonstrated that negative life events can disrupt the body's regulation of oxytocin. Decreased levels of oxytocin have been found in women exposed to early maltreatment—a relationship that was shown to be especially strong when the form of maltreatment was emotional abuse. Long term consequences Adolescence & adulthood Physical health development Children who experience maltreatment may be at greater risk for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular problems (e.g. heart attack, hypertension), endocrine dysfunction (e.g.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

At a media briefing, Mustafa Redha, MD, health ministry undersecretary, said 10 people who had close contact with the South Korean man in Kuwait have tested negative for the virus and the country has taken all steps needed to protect its citizens and visitors from the virus. According to reports from South Korean health officials, a few days before the man flew back to South Korea he visited a hospital in Kuwait twice for worsening diarrhea. Kuwait has not reported a MERS case since 2015, but the virus is known to circulate widely in dromedary camels in the Middle East and beyond. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH) recorded two new MERS-CoV cases this week, both connected to camel exposure, according to an update today. A 44-year-old man from Riyadh and a 64-year-old man from Hofuf were both diagnosed as having MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and are hospitalized for their infections. Both cases are described as primary and linked to camel contact. Camel contact, both direct and indirect, is one of the known risk factors for MERS transmission. The new activity appears to have raised MERS case totals to 2,251 globally since 2012, including 798 deaths. The outbreak began on Sep 1, and as of Sep 11, 2,000 suspected cases have been reported, 58 of them confirmed and 24 fatal. Cases have been reported in 5 of the country's 10 provinces. The government is weighing the benefits of a possible oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign, and the WHO is deploying an expert in OCV campaigns to Harare. Henan, Wuxi, Hefei, Shanghai, Inner Mongolia suspended trade of living poultry on 21 January. Financial Times described the outbreak as China's Chernobyl moment, increasing the pressure on its leader, Xi Jinping. A trade war with the US, Hong Kong protests, and an African swine fever outbreak that led to a pork shortage already placed pressure on the current government.

A group of eight medical personnel, including Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist from Wuhan Central Hospital, who in late December posted warnings on a new coronavirus strain akin to SARS, were warned by Wuhan police for \"spreading rumours\" for likening it to SARS.

Mao Qun'an, spokesman for the National Health and Family Planning Commission, said on Wednesday that China faces a \"substantially increased risk\" of more imported cases. Mao made his remarks at a news conference as the condition of China's first confirmed MERS patient, who is from South Korea, was reported to be in stable condition at a hospital in Guangdong province. \"Stakeholders like the border control and quarantine authorities and health facilities have been well-prepared for an outbreak response. Inspections of disease control and treatment work will be performed at high risk regions like south Guangdong province and the capital of Beijing,\" he said. MERS is a respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, similar to SARS. The first human case emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012. There is no vaccine or treatment for the virus, which has a fatality rate of about 40 percent. Also on Wednesday, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine ordered border quarantine staff to refer suspected cases to designated hospitals for further investigation. Visitors from affected areas should honestly report symptoms like fever, coughing and difficulty breathing, it said. Chinese who are heading to affected areas should avoid visiting local hospitals and having contact with bats and single-hump camels. China will consider issuing outbound travel alert if \"we detect infection among returned travelers from affected areas\", He said. A Chinese woman living in South Korea has tested positive for MERS, the National Health and Family Planning Commission said on Wednesday. The patient, 64, had come into close contact with a confirmed MERS patient at a South Korean hospital where she works. Zhong Nanshan, a respiratory expert in Guangdong, said a massive outbreak of MERS in China is unlikely given a lack of evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The first-of-its-kind therapy treats cancer by altering a patient's own cells to fight cancer. If you have questions or think you might be a candidate, please discuss with your physician. Over the past several years, cancer researchers have discovered the impact that the immune system can have on treating and preventing cancer. In particular, researchers at Penn Medicine’s Abramson Cancer Center have identified the effect of T cells, which are responsible for the identification and destruction of abnormal substances, like cancer. This treatment allows for the body’s immune system to be super charged with large quantities of CAR T cells which will seek out and attack cancer cells. Who can benefit from this new treatment? If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with ALL, speak with the treating oncologist about all options for treatment. Will this work for my type of cancer? For additional information on current clinical trials available at the Abramson Cancer Center please click here. This treatment has been approved by the FDA and may be covered or reimbursed by your insurance. What are questions I should ask my or my child’s oncologist? How is the treatment given and what is the procedure like? How many treatments are needed and how long will they take to be given? What are the chances of remission or cure? As researchers have learned more about what makes cancer cells different from normal cells, they have developed mAbs to exploit these differences. Newer forms of mAbs are less likely to cause immune reactions. One part attaches to a cancer cell, while the other attaches to an immune cell, bringing the two together and leading to an immune response. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. Cancer cells sometimes take advantage of these checkpoints to avoid being attacked by the immune system. Researchers have also found promising early results against a number of other cancer types. Only a handful of these treatments have been approved for use so far, but many others are now being studied in clinical trials. In melanoma, this combined approach has been shown to work better than using either treatment alone, but the combination also comes with an increased risk of serious side effects. As researchers have learned over the years, the immune system is very complex. It has also become clear that cancer cells have different ways of eluding the immune system, which makes creating effective vaccines difficult. The cells are altered (and killed) in the lab to make them more likely to be attacked by the immune system and then injected back into the patient. Most tumor cell vaccines are autologous, meaning the vaccine is made from killed tumor cells taken from the same person in whom they will later be used. The antigens are usually proteins or pieces of proteins called peptides. They break down cancer cells into smaller pieces (including antigens), and then hold out these antigens so other immune cells called T cells can see them. Doctors remove some immune cells from the patient’s blood and expose them in the lab to cancer cells or cancer antigens, as well as to other chemicals that turn the immune cells into dendritic cells and help them grow. The dendritic cells are then injected back into the patient, where they should cause an immune response to cancer cells in the body. Finally, these vaccines might be easier and less expensive to make than some other vaccines. This is not a complete list – vaccines are being studied in other types of cancer as well. For information on newer treatments for a particular type of cancer, please see our information on that type of cancer. These are known as oncolytic viruses. An example is talimogene laherparepvec (Imlygic), which is an oncolytic virus that has been modified to make GM-CSF, a protein that boosts the immune response. This virus can be used to treat melanomas in the skin or lymph nodes that can’t be removed with surgery. It is injected directly into the tumors, typically every 2 weeks. This treatment can sometimes shrink these tumors, but it has not been shown to shrink tumors in other parts of the body. These types of treatments show a lot of promise, but they are complex and so far are available only through clinical trials being done at major medical centers. These receptors will attach to proteins on the surface of cancer cells. These approvals are based on the results of clinical trials showing that in many patients the cancer could no longer be found after treatment. It is not yet clear if these treatments will result in a long-term cure. Researchers are also still learning about long-term side effects of\n\nPHILADELPHIA — When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig’s bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans. The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example. The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. “We’re saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit’s end trying to keep alive,” said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission. Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure. It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient’s blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis’s sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use. One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others. Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead. The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy. After she received the therapy, Emily’s fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital’s intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. She was dramatically better within hours. Tests showed her cancer was gone. For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died. But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a “firestorm,” June said — one that brought them new resources. The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Which Cancer Therapies Use T-Cells? Here, in the context of cancer treatment, we are mainly concerned with that second type, the T-cell. In brief, it’s a cutting-edge therapy that genetically programs your own T-cells to be better at recognizing and attacking cancer within. Tinkering with your body’s immune system to try to fight cancer is not entirely new. Designed to act as a bridge between a cancer cell and a T-cell to promote cancer cell death. One of them, sipuleucel-T, sounds very much like a CAR T-cell therapy in that it uses your immune cells which are first collected from the bloodstream individually and then processed in the laboratory; they are activated and made to be more responsive to the tumor cells, then infused back into the bloodstream as the therapy. Ipilimumab is just one example of a medicine that works in this way. CAR-T cell therapies, however, are clearly their own distinct entity. T-cells are taken out of your body, genetically programmed to better recognize and kill tumor cells, and then re-introduced as the living therapy. These newer treatments generally arise out of the unfortunate fact that, for patients with late-stage disease, traditional cancer treatments, including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, oftentimes offer limited efficacy. So far, two CAR-T cell therapies have been FDA approved. These patients typically have a poor prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in nearly a dozen countries, 82 percent of patients went into remission. Besides relapsed or refractory pediatric and young adult patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). They receive infusions of immune globulins every few months as a protective measure. One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flu-like symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis isn’t planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. There are 30 to 35 medical centers designated to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training. This underscores the urgent medical need for these patients. Again, these drugs should be used with caution and only in only designated medical centers. But what exactly is CAR T-cell therapy? We spoke with Sattva Neelapu, M.D., to learn more. Doctors extract T cells (a type of white blood cell) from the patient’s blood and then add an artificial receptor (called a “chimeric antigen receptor”) to their surface. CAR T-cell therapy can cause some unusual side effects. The most common side effect of CAR T-cell therapy is called cytokine release syndrome, or CRS. It’s also known as a “cytokine storm.” About 70-90% of patients experience it, but it’s very short-term and only lasts about five to seven days. It usually starts around the second or third day after the infusion. There’s a very effective remedy for CRS now called tocilizumab, which reverses this side effect fairly quickly. The medicine was originally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but has since been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat CRS. The other side effect is known as “CRES,” which stands for “CAR T-cell-related encephalopathy syndrome.” It typically starts around day five after the infusion. Patients eventually recover all of their neurological functions. Which types of cancer can CAR T-cell therapy treat currently? We have different FDA-approved cell therapy products for each of these cancers, thanks to clinical trials. Indolent B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. The reason it fails in some patients is that the tumor cells mutate quickly and shed the target molecule, so the CAR T-cells can’t “see” the cancer anymore. But first, we have to show that it’s at least as effective — or more effective — than those therapies. What are some advantages of CAR T-cell therapy? CAR T-cell therapy is also a living drug, and its benefits can last for many years. Since the cells can persist in the body long-term, they will still recognize and attack cancer cells if and when there’s a relapse. These are patients whose cancers were deemed very aggressive and for whom other standards of care had failed. What type of patient is a good candidate for CAR T-cell therapy? Until late 2017, there was no standard of care for someone who had already been through two lines of treatment and not achieved remission. How easy is it for patients to obtain CAR T-cell therapy? If they’ve already been through two lines of unsuccessful treatment, they can get the FDA-approved commercial product. So, patients should ask their doctors early on about clinical trial options when they are considering treatment for their cancer. What’s the one thing you want patients to know about CAR T-cell therapy? And it’s offering hope to people who’d previously been given only about six months to live.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

No cases of SARS-CoV-1 have been reported worldwide since 2004. In December 2019, another strain of SARS-CoV was identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This new strain causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a disease which brought about the COVID-19 pandemic. The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV, R0, ranges from 2 to 4 depending on different analyses. That vaccine, however, is a prototype and not field-ready as of March 2020. Clinical isolation and quarantine remain the most effective means to prevent the spread of SARS. Avoiding travel to affected areas Wearing masks and gloves Keeping people with symptoms home from school Simple hygiene measures Isolating oneself as much as possible to minimize the chances of transmission of the virus Many public health interventions were made to try to control the spread of the disease, which is mainly spread through respiratory droplets in the air, either inhaled or deposited on surfaces and subsequently transferred to a body's mucous membranes. These interventions included earlier detection of the disease; isolation of people who are infected; droplet and contact precautions; and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), including masks and isolation gowns. This delayed infectious period meant that quarantine was highly effective; people who were isolated before day five of their illness rarely transmitted the disease to others. As of 2017, the CDC was still working to make federal and local rapid-response guidelines and recommendations in the event of a reappearance of the virus. Treatment of SARS is mainly supportive with antipyretics, supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation as needed. There is currently no proven antiviral therapy. Tested substances, include ribavirin, lopinavir, ritonavir, type I interferon, that have thus far shown no conclusive contribution to the disease's course. People with SARS-CoV must be isolated, preferably in negative-pressure rooms, with complete barrier nursing precautions taken for any necessary contact with these patients, to limit the chances of medical personnel becoming infected. Some of the more serious damage caused by SARS may be due to the body's own immune system reacting in what is known as cytokine storm. In early 2004, an early clinical trial on volunteers was planned. Prognosis Several consequent reports from China on some recovered SARS patients showed severe long-time sequelae. As a result of quarantine procedures, some of the post-SARS patients have been documented as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder. As with MERS and COVID-19, SARS resulted in significantly more deaths of males than females. The index patient, a farmer from Shunde, Foshan, Guangdong, was treated in the First People's Hospital of Foshan. The patient died soon after, and no definite diagnosis was made on his cause of death. Despite taking some action to control it, Chinese government officials did not inform the World Health Organization of the outbreak until February 2003. This lack of openness caused delays in efforts to control the epidemic, resulting in criticism of the People's Republic of China from the international community. The outbreak first came to the attention of the international medical community on 27 November 2002, when Canada's Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), an electronic warning system that is part of the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), picked up reports of a \"flu outbreak\" in China through Internet media monitoring and analysis and sent them to the WHO.

Thus,\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The novel virus was first identified from an outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019, and attempts to contain it there failed, allowing it to spread across the globe. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020. COVID-19 symptoms range from undetectable to deadly, but most commonly include fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Mutations have produced many strains (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and virulence. Treatments include monoclonal antibodies, novel antiviral drugs, and symptom control. Governmental interventions include travel restrictions, lockdowns, business restrictions and closures, workplace hazard controls, quarantines, testing systems, and tracing contacts of the infected. The resultant near-global lockdowns saw an unprecedented pollution decrease. The pandemic raised issues of racial and geographic discrimination, health equity, and the balance between public health imperatives and individual rights. Etymology The pandemic is known by several names. It is often referred in news media as the \"coronavirus pandemic\", despite the existence of other human coronaviruses that have caused epidemics and outbreaks (e.g. During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as \"coronavirus\", \"Wuhan coronavirus\", \"the coronavirus outbreak\" and the \"Wuhan coronavirus outbreak\" with the disease sometimes called \"Wuhan pneumonia\". Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent social stigma. WHO finalized the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020. Epidemiology Background SARS-CoV-2 is a newly discovered virus that is closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market there, but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier. The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of zoonotic origin, from bats or another closely-related mammal. Despite this, the subject has generated extensive speculation about alternative origins. The origin controversy heightened geopolitical divisions, notably between the United States and China. The earliest known infected person fell ill on 1December 2019. That individual did not have a connection with the later wet market cluster. Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms. Multiple studies claimed that total infections are considerably greater than reported cases. On 9 April 2020, preliminary results found that in Gangelt, the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 percent of a population sample tested positive for antibodies. Seroprevalence-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies. Deaths As of , more than deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response, time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health. Conversely, deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included. Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases, including those without a test, thereby increasing counts. Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 9.5 to 18.6 million by The Economist, as well as over 10.3 million by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Other studies refer to this metric as the 'infection fatality risk'. In November 2020, a review article in Nature reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for various countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%. In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), the first identified strain of the SARS coronavirus species severe acute respiratory syndrome–related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV).

For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. However, injecting hyaluronic acid into the affected joint is the most prevalent treatment technique. See this viscosupplementation injection video which displays the technique of injection with viscosupplementation for osteoarthritis of right elbow joint. Is Viscosupplementation Effective for Knee Joint Pain? However, not all patients of osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation. Only those patients who have mild to moderate osteoarthritis have shown significant improvement in their pain condition. Those having advanced destructive osteoarthritis with chronic knee pain do not seem to have any beneficial effect from viscosupplement injections. When the patients of osteoarthritis with mild to moderate knee joint pain do not get any relief from the following traditional treatments, they are recommended by the doctors to take viscosupplementation treatment. Joint aspiration and intra-articular LA/steroid injection. Once taken, the viscosupplementation injection is effective for 6-8 months. What is the Cost for Viscosupplementation Injection? What are the Side Effects of Viscosupplementation? The side effects of viscosupplement injections are generally mild. The most common side effects are local reactions at the knee joint such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. Viscosupplementation treatment is, till date, available for treating knee joint pains only. Watch the video on viscosupplementation treatments in India for more information on the subject. Euflexxa is an injectable medication used to treat knee pain in people with osteoarthritis (\"wear-and-tear arthritis\"). This fluid thins and become less able to lubricate and protect the knee joint as the inflammatory stress of osteoarthritis takes its toll. By injecting Euflexxa into the area, the viscosity and shock-absorbing properties of the synovial fluid can be restored, reducing joint pain and stiffness. The two-step process of drainage and joint lubrication is known as arthrocentesis plus viscosupplementation. After drainage, the Euflexxa injection is delivered into the joint space in the mid-kneecap region. Despite the potential benefits of treatment, viscosupplementation success rates can vary dramatically. What most doctors will agree is that viscosupplementation is not a quick fix. It is really only considered when conservative options have failed or as a means to delay more invasive procedures, such as knee surgery or knee replacement. It is also often used in place of traditional corticosteroid knee injections. Furthermore, repeated corticosteroid shots can actually accelerate cartilage damage. While effective, it only provides short-term relief of knee stiffness and pain. It does not regrow lost cartilage or reverse the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Doing so may reduce the weight-bearing stress on your knee and help you better control your symptoms without the need for intra-articular medications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord. Viscosupplementation is a medical procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee or other joints in patients whose pain has failed to respond to conservative approaches. Brand names of viscosupplementation solutions include Hylagan, Orthovisc, Supartz, and Synvisc – all of which we use at Unique Pain Medicine. During the procedure, a thick gel with a natural protein, hyaluronan or hyaluronic acid, is injected into the knee joint to provide lubrication and reduce inflammation. INJECTIONS CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO KNEE SURGERY, WHILE OTHERS, RELY ON THESE INJECTIONS FOR RELIEF FROM CHRONIC PAIN CAUSED BY AN INJURY OR OSTEOARTHRITIS. Viscosupplementation works by artificially supplementing the fluid in the joint which increases the viscosity or thickness of the lubrication. After proper sterilization, a needle is placed into the joint under live ultrasound or fluoroscopic guidance. A pre-filled syringe of viscosupplementation is then injected into the joint to help loosen the knee and reduce friction thereby decreasing pain, minimizing inflammation, and improving motion. This artificial lubrication will ideally “save” your knee from further deterioration, and help you to avoid surgery. Adds lubrication to the joint which restores movement and minimizes pain.

Osteoarthritis causes pain and stiffness, while cartilage issues — including “runner’s knee” and meniscus tears — may result in pain, weakness, and swelling. The first step in treating knee pain is often with physical rehabilitation to correct muscle imbalances and knee bracing. What are knee injections for pain? Knee injections treat knee pain, arthritis, osteoarthritis, swelling, and inflammation. Hyaluronan injections — also known as viscosupplementation — target only knee pain from osteoarthritis. If you are not getting relief from pain medications and other treatments, viscosupplementation knee injection may relieve your knee pain. This therapy increases the effectiveness of synovial fluid present in the knee joint. Usually, viscosupplementation knee injections are recommended to those patients who are not responding to exercise, physical therapy, or other medications. Viscosupplementation injections also provide improved knee joint mobility and joint range of motion. What is stem cell therapy for knee pain? Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and can be a major source of disability. Many older patients continue to be active in sports-related activities; therefore, the treatment of the active patient with osteoarthritis is becoming more common. There are no guidelines for the administration of corticosteroids, and they can be associated with increased risk of tendon rupture and infection. Viscosupplementation has gained popularity in the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, and can be a major source of disability. Traditional nonoperative treatment includes activity modification, weight loss, exercise, assistive devices, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs), analgesics, and corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment of osteoarthritis of the hip and knee is effective, but not indicated for early stages of the disease in all patients. Intraarticular corticosteroids are accepted as an important treatment modality, but currently there are no guidelines in regard to administration. In recent years, intraarticular viscosupplementation with hyaluronate-derived products has gained popularity as a modality for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee. The content of synovial fluid (lubricating fluid of joint), in the presence of osteoarthritis, has a decreased concentration and molecular weight of hyaluronic acid. Injections decrease inflammation and swelling, which decreases pain and increases joint mobility. The intraarticular corticosteroid cannot prevent the pain derived from weight-bearing forces across the joint. Therefore, it is thought that the primary effect of the corticosteroid is on the synovium. There is no clear, objective evidence for intraarticular corticosteroid injections on the treatment of osteoarthritic or sports-related injuries of knees, ankles, shoulders, acromioclavicular joints, lumbar facet joints, and smaller hand and foot joints. Injections around joints are associated with significant risk. Corticosteroid injections could cause ligament and tendon rupture, which is the reason many orthopedists do not recommend corticosteroid injections in these locations. Active infection of the skin and overlying tissues increases the risk of inoculating the joint during injection. Other absolute contraindications are hypersensitivity, presence of a joint prosthesis, and uncontrolled bleeding diathesis. Relative contraindications include anticoagulation therapy, joint instability, poorly controlled diabetes, and adjacent skin abrasions. The local effects include tendon and ligament rupture, cutaneous atrophy at the injection site, calcification of the joint capsule, and infection. They are approved for use in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. The most common side effects are local reactions of the knee such as swelling, pain, and increased warmth. There are many stages of osteoarthritis, in various locations, and in different patient populations. They are relatively inexpensive and safe, but do not have clear, long-term benefits, and can damage collagen structures surrounding joints. Orthopedic surgeons need to continue to use corticosteroids cautiously and conservatively. As older patients increase their activity and demand on their joints, there needs to be further research into the value and efficacy of hyaluronic acid for osteoarthritis of the knee.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Surgery to the vagina is done to correct congenital defects to the vagina, urethra and rectum. Labiaplasty, which alters the appearance of the vulva, can be performed as a discrete surgery, or as a subordinate procedure within a vaginoplasty. Congenital disorders such as adrenal hyperplasia can affect the structure and function of the vagina and sometimes the vagina is absent; these can be reconstructed or formed, using a vaginoplasty. Other candidates for the surgery include babies born with a microphallus, people with Müllerian agenesis resulting in vaginal hypoplasia, trans women, and women who have had a vaginectomy after malignancy or trauma. Vaginoplasty can reduce the size of the entrance of the vagina or alter the appearance of the vulva. A woman can use an autologous in vitro cultured tissue taken from her vaginal vestibule as transplanted tissue to form the lining of the reconstructed vagina. A reconstructed or newly constructed vagina is called a neovagina. Vaginoplasties in children Conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia virilize genetic females due to a 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Specific procedures include: clitoral reduction, labiaplasty, normalizing appearance, vagina creation, initiating vaginal dilation. Vaginal atresia, or congenital absence of the vagina can be another reason for surgery to construct a normal and functional vagina. There are human rights concerns about vaginoplasties and other genital surgeries in children who are not old enough to consent, including concern with post-surgical sexual function, and assumptions of cisnormativity. Techniques Non-surgical vagina creation was used in the past to treat the congenital absence of a vagina. Vaginoplasty is often performed to reconstruct the vagina and other genital structures. In some cases, normal sexual function can be restored. Other materials have been used to create the lining of the new vagina. Sex reassignment surgery Several techniques may be used in sex reassignment surgery to create a vagina. Penile inversion Inversion of the penile skin is the method most often selected to create a neovagina by surgeons performing sex reassignment surgery. The penile inversion technique was pioneered by Georges Burou in his Morocco clinic in the 1950s. Bowel vaginoplasty Bowel vaginoplasty is another commonly used method to create a neovagina in sex reassignment surgery. Compared to penile inversion, bowel vaginoplasty has the advantages of self-lubrication, depth, and reduced risk of stenosis. However, it carries the disadvantages of requiring abdominal surgery and the creation of a bowel anastomosis, excessive discharge and/or malodour, and prolapsed neovagina. Other methods Penile-scrotal skin flaps are also used. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a warning against these procedures in 2007 as did the Royal Australian College of Gynaecologists, and a commentary in the British Medical Journal strongly criticized the \"designer vagina\" in 2009. The World Health Organization describes any medically unnecessary surgery to the vaginal tissue and organs as female genital mutilation. Pull through or Vecchietti procedure In treating Müllerian agenesis, the Vecchietti procedure is a laparoscopic surgical technique that produces a vagina of dimensions (depth and width) comparable to those of a normal vagina (ca. A small, plastic sphere (“olive”) is threaded (sutured) against the vaginal area; the threads are drawn though the vaginal skin, up through the abdomen, and through the navel. There, the threads are attached to a traction device, and then daily are drawn tight so that the “olive” is pulled inwards and stretches the vagina, by approximately 1.0 cm. per day, thereby creating a vagina, approximately 7.0 cm.

The most widely used is the Vecchietti laparoscopic procedure. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible. Martin Birchall, who works on tissue engineering, but was not involved in \n\nRegeneration in humans is the regrowth of lost tissues or organs in response to injury. Numerous tissues and organs have been induced to regenerate. Other organs and body parts that have been procured to regenerate include: penis, fats, vagina, brain tissue, thymus, and a scaled down human heart. One goal of scientists is to induce full regeneration in more human organs. There are various techniques that can induce regeneration. By 2016, regeneration of tissue had been induced and operationalized by science. There are four main techniques: regeneration by instrument; regeneration by materials; regeneration by drugs and regeneration by in vitro 3D printing. History of human tissue In humans with non-injured tissues, the tissue naturally regenerates over time; by default, new available cells replace expended cells. For example, the body regenerates a full bone within ten years, while non-injured skin tissue is regenerated within two weeks. This emergency response usually involves building a degree of scar tissue over a time period longer than a regenerative response, as has been proven clinically and via observation. There are many more historical and nuanced understandings about regeneration processes. Advances in research have enabled the induced regeneration of many more tissues and organs than previously thought possible. The aim for these techniques is to use these techniques in the near future for the purpose of regenerating any tissue type in the human body. Regeneration techniques By 2016, regeneration had been operationalised and induced by four main techniques: regeneration by instrument; regeneration by materials; regeneration by 3d printing; and regeneration by drugs. Whilst by 2016, regeneration by 3d printing had been generally operationalised by in vitro (inside the lab) in order to be built and prepare tissue for transplantation. In 1976, a 3 by 3cm scar on a non-diabetic was regenerated by insulin injections and the researchers, highlighting earlier research, argued that the insulin was regenerating the tissue. This technology was first used inside a broken urethra in 1996. In 2012, using materials, a full urethra was restored in vivo. In 2017, hydrogels provided full regeneration of skin, with hair follicles, after partial excision of scars in pigs and after full thickness wound incisions in pigs. By 3D printing In 2009, the regeneration of hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, was a little more challenging. Therefore, to regenerate hollow organs and tissues with a long diffusion distance, the tissue had to be regenerated inside the lab, via the use of a 3D printer. Various tissues that have been regenerated by in vitro 3D printing include: The first organ ever induced and made in the lab was the bladder, which was created in 1999. By 2014, there had been various tissues regenerated by the 3D printer and these tissues included: muscle, vagina, penis and the thymus. In 2014, a conceptual human lung was first bioengineered in the lab. In 2015, the lab robustly tested its technique and regenerated a pig lung. The pig lung was then successfully transplanted into a pig without the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In 2015, researchers developed a proof of principle biolimb inside a laboratory; they also estimated that it would be at least a decade for any testing of limbs in humans. The prototype heart was made by human stem cells but only to the size of a rabbit's heart. In 2012, within 60 days it was possible, inside the lab, to grow tissue the size of half a postage stamp to the size of a football field. Most cell types could be grown and expanded outside of the body, with the exception of the liver, nerve and pancreas, as these tissue types need stem cell populations. In 1984, it was shown that different insulin injections have different regenerative responses with regards to creating skin fats in the same person. In 2016, scientists could transform a skin cell into any other tissue type via the use of drugs. The technique was noted as safer than genetic reprogramming which, in 2016, was a concern medically. The technique, used a cocktail of chemicals and enabled efficient on site regeneration without any genetic programming. In 2017, scientists could turn many cell types (such as brain and heart) into skin.

What Are the Risks Associated With Heart Transplants? The donor is a person who has died and whose family has agreed to donate their loved one's organs. In the more than four decades since the performance of the first human heart transplant in 1967, heart transplantation has changed from an experimental operation to an established treatment for advanced heart disease. More than 2,000 heart transplants are performed each year in the U.S. Each year thousands more would benefit from a heart transplant if more donated hearts were available. People who have advanced (end stage) heart failure, but are otherwise healthy, may be considered for a heart transplant. Can you adhere to the lifestyle changes, including complex drug treatments and frequent exams, required after a transplant? If you answered 'no' to any of the above questions, a heart transplant may not be for you. Also, if you have additional medical problems, such as other severe diseases, active infections, or severe obesity, you most likely will not be considered a candidate for transplant. In order to get a heart transplant, you must first be placed on a transplant list. But, before you can be placed on the transplant list, you must go through a careful screening process. A team of heart doctors, nurses, social workers, and bioethicists review your medical history, diagnostic test results, social history, and psychological test results to see if you are able to survive the procedure and then comply with the continuous care needed to live a long, healthy life. Donors for heart transplants are individuals who may have recently died or become brain dead, which means that although their body is being kept alive by machines, the brain has no sign of life. Many times, these donors died as a result of a car accident, severe head injury, or a gunshot wound. Donor organs are located through the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) computerized national waiting list. This waiting list assures equal access and fair distribution of organs when they become available. When a heart becomes available for transplantation, it is given to the best possible match, based on blood type, body size, UNOS status (based on the recipient's medical condition), and the length of time the recipient has been waiting. The race and gender of the donor have no bearing on the match. All donors are screened for Hepatitis B and C and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Unfortunately, not enough hearts are available for transplant. At any given time, almost 3,500 to 4,000 people are waiting for a heart or heart-lung transplant. A person may wait months for a transplant and more than 25% do not live long enough to get one. Many people who are waiting for transplantation have mixed feelings, because they are aware that someone must die before an organ becomes available. It may help to know that many donor families feel a sense of peace knowing that some good has come from their loved one's death. Once a donor heart becomes available, a surgeon from the transplant center surgically removes the heart from the donor's body. The surgeon will make sure the donor heart is in good condition before beginning the transplant surgery. The transplant surgery will take place as soon as possible after the donor heart becomes available. The backs of the atria on the donor heart are opened and the heart is sewn into place. Most patients are up and around within a few days after surgery, and if there are no signs of the body immediately rejecting the organ, patients are allowed to go home within seven to 16 days. And many of them have no symptoms, such as angina, because they have no sensation in their donor hearts. Rejection occurs when the body's immune cells recognize the transplanted heart as different from the rest of the body and attempt to destroy it. If left alone, the immune system would damage the cells of a donor heart and eventually destroy it. To prevent rejection, patients receive several drugs called immunosuppressants. These drugs suppress the immune system so that the donor heart is not damaged. Because rejection can occur anytime after a transplant, immunosuppressive drugs are given to patients the day before their transplant and thereafter for the rest of their lives. To avoid rejection, heart transplant recipients must strictly adhere to their immunosuppressant drug regimen. Without an active enough immune system, a patient can easily develop severe infections. The Myocardial Biopsy: Heart transplant recipients are carefully monitored for signs of rejection. Doctors frequently take samples of small pieces of the transplanted heart to inspect under a microscope. For this reason, drugs are also prescribed to fight infections. It is vital for you to be aware of the possible signs of rejection and infection so you can report them to your health care providers and be treated immediately. With the exception of having to take lifelong medication to keep the body from rejecting the donor heart, many heart transplant recipients lead long and productive lives. As mentioned, after a heart transplant, patients must take several drugs. The most important are those to keep the body from rejecting the transplant. To combat these problems, additional drugs are often prescribed. Heart transplant recipients are encouraged to exercise to improve the function of the heart and to avoid weight gain. However, due to changes in the heart related to the transplant, patients should speak to their doctor or cardiac rehabilitation specialist before beginning an exercise program. Because the nerves leading to the heart are cut during the operation, the transplanted heart beats faster (about 100 to 110 beats per minute) than the normal heart (about 70 beats per minute). After transplant, the patient may need to follow a special diet, which may involve many of the same dietary changes made prior to surgery. How long you live after a heart transplant depends on many factors, including age, general health, and response to the transplant. The 10-year survival rate is about 56%. In most cases, the costs related to a heart transplant are covered by health insurance. Medicaid programs in most states and the District of Columbia also reimburse for transplants. The Methodist Heart Hospital has provided patients with an information and educational resource page to aid in the heart failure and transplant journey. Please review the Heart Failure Manual, Heart Transplant Manual , glossary and list of frequently asked questions. Some people with heart failure are prescribed blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke. They assist in many ways, from making sure patients take their medications properly to helping out with day-to-day activities. Heart failure is almost always a chronic illness. Heart transplant - Surgery that replaces a damaged heart with a healthy heart taken from a donor who has been declared brain dead. Right-ventricular heart failure - Heart failure caused by\n\nWhen Petra Brosch’s heart stopped beating during a routine run on Elwood beach, it was the beginning of a journey that would see The Alfred’s specialists drawing on the latest in cutting-edge medicine to save her life. The 35-year-old was suffering irreparable heart failure that would see her rely on life support, then an artificial heart and ultimatley organ transplant. “At the time we had no idea why her heart had failed but, when she arrived in the emergency department, it took only a few minutes to decide that to give her the best chance of survival. We would need to put her on ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation)”, Dr Tan said. During ECMO, a thin tube called cannula is inserted into the patient to remove blood, which is passed through a machine that gives it oxygen. Dr Peter Bergin, Medical Director of the Heart Failure and Transplant Service at The Alfred, said there were no warning signs that Petra was born with an unusual heart. In Australia, it’s used in patients who are waiting for a heart transplant, and it can remain inside the body for years. However, it was critical to her survival that she receive the mechanical help so that she could stand up. Petra, to the surprise of staff, stood up in ICU – an encouraging sign and a big step towards being eligible to go onto the heart transplantation list. This section of the Trillium Gift of Life Network (TGLN) website provides basic information to those waiting for an organ and tissue transplant and those that have received the gift of life. Putting plans in place to meet the needs of current and future transplants. Using electronic information and technology to support healthcare professionals to improve safety, quality and efficiency TGLN continues to grow the awareness and importance of organ and tissue donation and transplantation in the drive to save and enhance lives. There are hundreds of diseases that affect organs and tissues to the point that a transplant is required, but not everybody that suffers from disease requires one. Organs that can be transplanted are the liver, small bowel, kidney, pancreas, heart, and lung. This kidney takes over the work of the two kidneys that failed, so you no longer need dialysis. Transplanted kidneys come from a deceased or living donor. Transplanted livers can come from a deceased or living donor. Doctors do liver transplants when other treatment options fail. Post surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Lung transplant surgery can replace one or both diseased lungs. Lungs can come from either a deceased or living donor. A transplant may be recommended if you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, interstitial lung diseases, or primary pulmonary hypertension, among others. A heart transplant replaces a damaged/diseased heart with a healthy one from a donor who has died. This is the final treatment option for people with heart failure where all other options have failed. As with other transplants, you must take medication to prevent your body from rejecting the new heart. Islet cell transplantation replaces only the part of the pancreas that makes insulin. Islet transplants are done alone or together with a kidney transplant. Transplanted islet cells come from deceased donors. People who have transplants must take medication to keep their body from rejecting the new organ. TPN nutrition is where liquid nutrition is given through a drip. After surgery, you will need to take medication to prevent organ rejection. Tissue transplantation includes corneas, skin, bone, cardiovascular tissue the islet cells of the pancreas and connective tissue. One donor can provide tissue for many recipients undergoing various procedures. Skin is one of the most common types of tissue transplanted. Some people think that age determines whether they can register to donate their skin - The fact is, everyone is a potential donor. One tissue donor can enhance the lives of 75 people. Reasons for connective tissue transplantation might be due to trauma or cancer. One of the most successful achievements in the history of medicine is in the world of transplantation. Regardless of the medical and technological advancements, more needs to be done. Canada is still faced with a greater need for organs and tissue than the number available for transplantation. Canada’s first successful kidney transplant is done between identical twins in Montreal, Quebec. Canada’s first heart transplant occurs in Montreal, Quebec. Islet cells are transplanted into a patient with Diabetes in Edmonton, Alberta (now called the Edmonton Protocol). The first living related liver transplant in Canada occurs in London, Ontario, when a mother donates part of her liver to her son. First living-related double lung transplant, where two people each donated part of a lung in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Canada’s first adult to adult living-related liver transplant in London, Ontario. “Halifax Protocol” – the successful combination of two anti- rejection drugs that drastically reduces organ rejection – earns international attention in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Even though the list of people waiting for a lifesaving or transforming transplant continues to be long, the success rates for transplants continue to improve each year. If you are thinking about transplantation or are already on the organ/tissue transplant waiting list, you probably have lots of questions. The following pages provide a few basic answers to help you as you move through your transplantation journey. Don’t be afraid to raise any questions with your healthcare team at your transplant centre. Find a designated transplant centre near you by clicking the pins on the map of Ontario. This could mean your family physician, general practitioner or members of your\n\nIn a bold and very challenging move, thoracic surgeons at Toronto General Hospital (TGH) removed severely infected lungs from a dying mom, keeping her alive without them for six days, so that she could recover enough to receive a life-saving lung transplant. It was made possible by advanced life support technology, a dedicated and diverse surgical, respirology, intensive care and perfusion team, as well as the grit and gumption of the patient, Melissa Benoit, and her close-knit family. \"This was bold and very challenging, but Melissa was dying before our eyes,\" recalls Dr. Shaf Keshavjee, Surgeon-in-Chief, Sprott Department of Surgery at UHN, one of three thoracic surgeons who operated together on Melissa to remove both her lungs. \"Melissa gave us the courage to go ahead.\" Melissa, then 32, was brought into TGH's Medical Surgical Intensive Care Unit (MSICU) in early April 2016, sedated and on a ventilator to help her laboured breathing. For the past three years, Melissa, who has cystic fibrosis, had been prescribed antibiotics to fight off increasingly frequent chest infections. A recent bout of influenza just before her hospital admission had left Melissa gasping for air, with coughing fits so harsh that she fractured her ribs. As Dr. Niall Ferguson, Head of Critical Care Medicine at UHN and Mount Sinai Hospital, describes it, the influenza \"tipped her over the edge into respiratory failure. Her only hope of recovery was a lung transplant.\" Melissa's oxygen levels dipped so low, conventional ventilation was no longer enough. To help her breathe, and to gain more time until donor lungs became available, physicians placed her on Extra-Corporeal Lung Support (ECLS), a temporary life-support medical device that supports the work of the lungs and heart. Despite this, Melissa's condition worsened. The bacteria in her lungs developed resistance to most antibiotics, and spread throughout her body. She slid into septic shock, triggering inflammation, leaky blood vessels and reduced blood flow. Melissa was now on maximum doses of three medications to maintain her blood pressure, along with the most advanced respiratory support, and on last-line powerful antibiotics, the last option for patients resistant to other available antibiotics. The team was still waiting for donor lungs but, by this time, Melissa was too sick to have a lung transplant. Removing both her lungs – the source of bacterial infection – could save her life. Dr. Cypel gathered his colleagues, calling in Dr. Keshavjee, Dr. Tom Waddell, Head of Thoracic Surgery at UHN, Dr. Ferguson, and respirologist Dr. Mathew Binnie – all seasoned and well-known for their skills in navigating complex cases, along with Melissa's husband, mom and dad. The surgical team had been discussing the concept of this procedure for several years. They had observed patients with cystic fibrosis, waiting for a lung transplant, who developed severe lung infections. While the team faced many unknowns – risk of bleeding into an empty chest cavity, whether her blood pressure and oxygen levels could be supported afterwards, and if she would even survive the operation – they agreed that Melissa was a possible candidate, and that it was her only chance, although a slim one. As Dr. Keshavjee explained, she likely still had enough strength to withstand the procedure and get better afterwards; the source of the infection was clear-cut and difficult to control in current circumstances; the family understood the risks and explained that Melissa had often told them she would want to try everything possible to live for her husband, Chris, and two-year-old daughter, Olivia. \"Things were so bad for so long, we needed something to go right,\" remembers, Chris, \"and this new procedure was the first piece of good news in a long time. As Melissa tells it, Chris was the one who \"held my life in his hands...He had to trust in himself, knowing me, relying on past conversations, and he chose exactly what I would have told him to.\" Melissa's mom, Sue, was so eager to save her daughter's life, she urged the team to go ahead: \"Melissa always volunteers for any study or clinical trial. Cypel, Keshavjee and Waddell - removed Melissa's lungs, one at a time, in a nine-hour procedure. To keep Melissa alive, she was placed on the most sophisticated support possible for her heart and lungs. Two external life support circuits were connected to her heart via tubes placed through her chest. Six days later, a pair of donor lungs became available and Melissa was stable enough to receive a lung transplant in late April 2016. \"The transplant procedure was not complicated because half of it was done already,\" noted Dr. Cypel, \"Her new lungs functioned beautifully and inflated easily. The medical team is developing criteria for the select types of patients who could be candidates for this novel procedure while waiting for a lung transplantation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Previous studies have found that women on tamoxifen have increased bone mineral density. And patients taking tamoxifen, compared to another class of breast cancer drugs, aromatase inhibitors, have a reduced risk of fracture. Current use of tamoxifen reduced osetoporosis-related fracture risk overall by 32 percent and reduced hip fractures by 53 percent. Breast cancer patients are known to be at increased risk for osteoporosis and all types of fractures because of the effects of chemotherapy and other drugs used to treat the disease. It is often used to treat patients with early stage breast cancer and those whose cancer has spread. They work by lowering the amount of estrogen in the body but have been associated with decreased bone density, upping fracture risk. \"We have known from large breast cancer trials comparing tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors that the fracture rates were higher in [those who got] aromatase inhibitors than tamoxifen,\" she said. \"But we had not known whether the fracture rate on tamoxifen was lower than in women not being given tamoxifen and given nothing. Russell said the study results may cause some doctors to rethink when they prescribe tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society's deputy chief medical officer, said the take-home message from the new study was this: \"If you switch from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors, or if you stop tamoxifen, you must be aware your osteoporosis risk may increase.\" Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disorder characterized by low bone mass, micro-architectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to bone fragility, and consequent increase in fracture risk. Osteoporosis may be due to lower-than-normal maximum bone mass and greater-than-normal bone loss. Osteoporosis may also occur due to a number of diseases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney disease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certain medications increase the rate of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. This is typically measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase the rate of bone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Bisphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. In those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are less effective. They do not appear to affect the risk of death. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. In the United States in 2010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. The word \"osteoporosis\" is from the Greek terms for \"porous bones\". Signs and symptoms Osteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures. The term \"established osteoporosis\" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of frailty syndrome. glaucoma, macular degeneration), balance disorder, movement disorders (e.g. Parkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss of skeletal muscle). Risk factors Risk factors for osteoporotic fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, the use of medication that increases osteoporosis risk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable The most important risk factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and women) and female sex; estrogen deficiency following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels has a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for osteoporosis. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable Excessive alcohol: Although small amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not been conclusively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are unclear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activity of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. High blood acidity may be diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis A meta-analysis of published medical studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show significant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so physical inactivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase peak bone mass achieved in adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. This effect might be caused by intense training suppressing menstruation, producing amenorrhea, and it is part of the female athlete triad.

Studies have shown that bisphosphonate medications like Bondronat may increase the risk of atypical femur fractures and a disfiguring jaw injury known as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). Bondronat Bone Fracture Update 5/24/12: In a study published this week by the Archives of Internal Medicine, Swiss researchers reached conclusions similar to those reached earlier this month by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) – that taking osteoporosis drugs from the bisphosphonate class can increase the risk of atypical bone fractures. Taken cumulatively, the results of the study seem to suggest that the risk of fractures increased over time while the benefits of the drugs decreased. Osteoporosis is a chronic debilitating disease that affects approximately 45 million people nationwide, typically affecting post-menopausal women by decreasing the density and strength of bones. If left untreated, osteoporosis can lead to severe fractures of the spine, hip and thigh. As the population of our nation continues to age, so too will the number of people suffering from the effects of osteoporosis continue to increase. Drugs from the bisphosphonate class are designed to bind tightly to tissue, thereby preventing calcium from being removed and sustaining bone density.

Several countries have specialised recycling or disposal systems for fluorescent bulbs, e.g. The U.S. EPA states that using energy-efficient CFLs reduces demand for power, which reduces the amount of coal burned by power plants and hence reduces the amount of mercury emitted from coal fired power plants. Other conditions associated with fluorescent light\nIn rare cases individuals with solar urticaria (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light. Standard acrylic diffusers over the fluorescent lamps absorb nearly all the UV-B radiation and appear to protect against this. The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines, and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences.

The artificial sweeteners in diet sodas are causing people to gain weight. There is still a lot to be learned about how artificial sweeteners affect the human body. There have been some recent studies concerning women who drink diet drinks and how they affect their hearts as well as their weight. This could mean there is a possible link between the chemistry of diet soda in a woman’s metabolism and this is problematic as cardiovascular disease has come to the forefront concerning artificial sweeteners and it is shocking the power those chemicals truly contain. A Fellow in cardiovascular disease at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, as well as, head researcher for the study, Dr. Vyas, says that diet drinks can be linked to metabolic syndrome. Saccharin, Sucralose, and other artificial sweeteners are also linked to cancer. Aspartame can also be linked to lymphoma and leukemia. However, researchers cannot say with any amount of certainty that diet soda is directly linked to cardiovascular disease, only that there is an association between diet sodas and cardiovascular issues. This should prompt scientists to conduct more research. Women who drink diet sodas heavily could be more likely to experience blood clots and cardiovascular problems than those who rarely or never consume diet beverages, according to the large study that was conducted in 2014. Participants of the study had to estimate how many artificially sweetened diet drinks they had every day over the past three months. Approximately nine percent of the women in the study who drank two or more a day experienced a serious heart episode, compared to the seven percent of the women who rarely or never drank artificially sweetened drinks. The study concluded that women who drank two or more diet drinks a day had a higher incidence of diabetes, smoking, obesity, and hypertension, which are all risk factors for heart disease. According to Marcelle Pick, OB/GYN, NP, diet sodas may be free of calories and sugar, but they are filled with other health-draining chemicals, such as caffeine, sodium, artificial sweeteners, and phosphoric acid. There are other studies that reveal diet sodas can cause weight gain. Instead of trading regular soda for diet products, trade it in for water, which the body needs and can always use anyway. Pick says that diet sodas are misleading. If a woman’s goal is to lose weight, diet sodas are sabotaging their efforts. However, Pick says water is still the best option. There has been a variety of studies on the subject, but most of the studies show that diet soda can cause people to gain even more weight. A correlation was made between the consumption of all sodas and obesity. What was shocking to Fowler was that if the team only focused on the people who drank diet sodas, the obesity risk was higher. She learned that for each can of diet soda consumed a day, the risk of obesity was increased by 41 percent. Different studies have found several variations, but there is a pattern. Artificial sweeteners cause the body to send the right sweet signals to the brain, but the sugar does not get delivered. Experts are not saying that diet sodas themselves are creating weight gain. In more simple terms, ingesting artificial sweeteners that seem real to the body can set people up to consume more food later. This belief came from a study conducted on rats at Purdue University. Moreover, there are times when people will choose the diet soda in order to give themselves permission to eat something with more calories later. The study suggests that by increasing insulin, soft drinks could also increase the risk of cancer developing. Interestingly those who drank fruit juice, which is also high in sugar, didn’t have an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. “The sugar load and resultant weight gain increases the risk of heart disease,” Jamieson says. “The effects on insulin levels, cholesterol, blood pressure and inflammation are also culprits.” As a guide, a can of regular soft drink contains about 41g of sugar. Women who consume three or more cola-based drinks a day have almost 4 per cent lower bone density than those who drink non-cola based drinks, thereby increasing their risk of osteoporosis, according to Tufts University in the US. The phosphoric acid in cola can leech calcium from bones, while “caffeine is known to be associated with the risk of lower bone mineral density”, Tucker added. However, research has not fully supported this tenet. He was found to be profoundly hypokalaemic with a serum potassium level of 1.4 mmol ⁄ l. He had been drinking 4l of Coca-Cola per day over the past 3 years, and drank up to 10l to slake his thirst when he went for kangaroo-shooting at night. He was advised to curtail his cola drinking, and his potassium level normalised, his weakness resolved, and he made a full recovery (1). Over the course of 2 years, he had persistent hypokalaemia in the 2.7–3.3 mmol ⁄ l range and complained of ongoing generalised weakness and 2–3 loose stools per day. I asked him how much he drank, and he said that he sipped it continuously, 4l per day. He was not willing to stop drinking cola, but he did agree to reduce his intake to 2l per day. Sugar sweetened soft drinks have been shown to cause obesity, type 2 diabetes, dental decay and metabolic syndrome. They appear also to increase the risk for osteoporosis, gout, gastroesophageal reﬂux disease, hypovitaminosis C, albuminuria and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The only therapeutic use of soft drinks is described in a few case reports of the successful use of Coca-Cola to dissolve phytobezoars. In their review of cola-induced hypokalaemia, Tsimihodimos et al. make a compelling argument that potassium depletion should be added to the long list of soft drink-related health problems. In the cases they describe, chronic consumption of 3–10l of sugar-sweetened cola per day led to severe hypokalaemia, hypokalaemic myopathy, and in some cases, hypokalaemic paralysis. One patient developed hypokalaemic nephropathy and subsequent nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. In all cases, the patients’ symptoms improved, and the hypokalaemia resolved with potassium repletion and reduction or cessation of cola drinking. Second, drinks containing large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup send boluses of largely indigestible fructose into the GI tract, which causes potassium wasting via an osmotic diarrhoea. Third, caffeine has been shown to cause beta adrenergic stimulation, increase Na+⁄K+-ATPase via cellular phosphodiesterase inhibition, and produce metabolic alkalosis, diuresis and increased renin levels, all of which may contribute to hypokalaemia. Based on case reports of hypokalaemia from both caffeine-free soft drinks and caffeine products (such as coffee and tea) without sugar or high-fructose corn syrup, any or all of the above mechanisms may be at work in various individuals drinking various beverages. However, soft drinks that combine large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup with caffeine, such as regular colas, might deplete potassium stores more effectively because of concurrent osmotic and caffeine-mediated potassium wasting. One might argue that people who drink 3–10l of cola per day are outliers, and that excessive soft drink consumption at this level is so rare that it is not a public health issue. Consider, too, the marketing of the soft drink. With aggressive mass marketing, super-sizing of soft drinks, and the effects of caffeine tolerance and dependence, there is very little doubt that tens of millions of people in industrialised countries drink at least 2–3l of cola per day. As our heavy cola drinkers age and develop obesity, hypertension and diabetes, they will become more vulnerable to the potentially lethal effects of chronic hypokalaemia. Another concern is that even moderate chronic cola consumption has been found to be associated with CKD. A comparison of 465 patients with newly diagnosed CKD and 467 community controls in North Carolina showed a twofold increased risk of CKD in patients who drank two or more cola drinks (16 ounces) per day (9). Most government responses to soft drink health concerns have focused on protecting children from youth-targeted advertising and in school vending machines. This same focus seems to hold in the medical profession, where paediatricians are generally more aware of the health risks of soft drinks, and probably more likely than internists to discuss them with their patients. In addition to the usual questions about alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use, internists need to start asking their adult patients about soft drink consumption. Cola drinks need to be added to the physician’s checklist of drugs and substances (such as liquorice) that can cause hypokalaemia. More work is needed on the epidemiology of cola consumption, hypokalaemia and cardiovascular disease rates. Ann Intern Med 1986; 105: 468.\nstudy. Arch Intern Med 2002; 162: 1007–12.

The proposal also provides for prompt removal of the drug from the market if further review determines the therapy to be ineffective. In controlled clinical studies, 10 to 12 percent of patients discontinued treatment because of these complications. \"In this way, we can approve drugs that are both safe and effective as quickly as possible.\" The drug, manufactured and distributed by Hoffman La Roche of Nutley, N.J., is administered orally every eight hours in combination with AZT. Both FDA and NIH are Public Health Service agencies within HHS. November 1991 - April 1992 -- FDA actively working with Hoffman-La Roche to discuss data, work out additional analyses. April - June 1992 -- Continuing meetings between Hoffman-La Roche and FDA on labeling. Hoffman La Roche committed to series of studies to further demonstrate efficacy and better define appropriate clinical use. June 19, 1992 -- ddC approved by FDA. First drug approved since the Vice President announced FDA's accelerated drug approval process. Process incorporates use of surrogate endpoints to determine efficacy. Process allows for approval to be withdrawn if further review determines the therapy to be ineffective. Drugs approved in normal process take an average of 10 years in development and 2 years for FDA review of the NDA. ddC's development took four years and the FDA review, including intensive discussions and soliciting more data, took 8 months. Few deliberations have greater bearing on human health than when the Food and Drug Administration weighs the risks and benefits of drugs designed to treat life-threatening diseases, such as cancer. FDA physicians who specialize in treating cancer (oncologists), chemists, statisticians, microbiologists, pharmacologists, immunologists, and other experts work in concert to evaluate cancer drug data, weigh the risks and benefits, and reach a decision to approve or not approve. If the scale is tipped on the side of benefits, the drug is approved and allowed on the U.S. market. Patients, doctors, caregivers, and family members must also weigh the risks and benefits of drugs to decide which treatments to use. Cancer drugs are regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act. Under the acts, the FDA may approve a new drug for marketing in the United States if it is supported by substantial evidence of safety and effectiveness demonstrated in adequate and well-controlled studies. The drug's manufacturer or marketer must show this evidence by submitting an application to the FDA that includes results from studies of the drug's use in people (clinical trials). FDA oncologists and other agency experts review cancer drug applications and evaluate the study results. When seeking outside advice regarding drug approval or drug labeling. the FDA calls upon the expertise of a group of leading cancer specialists, clinical practitioners, and patient representatives who make up the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC). At an ODAC meeting, the pharmaceutical company presents findings from clinical trials on safety and effectiveness of the drug, and FDA staff present their assessments after reviewing the drug application, which includes extensive documentation about the drug's chemistry. its proposed use for one or more specific purposes, and data from clinical trials. The ODAC carefully considers the presentations and votes on questions posed by the FDA intended to guide the agency in its decision to approve or not approve the drug for marketing or for a new claim. the commercial sponsor may show that the drug works better than an inactive substance (placebo). but generally does not have to show that it works as well or better than other drugs on the market to treat the same illness. Studies involving cancer drugs usually do not use placebos, says Patricia Cortazar, M.D., an oncologist in the FDA's Office of Oncology Drug Products. \"Because cancer is a life-threatening illness, it would not be ethical to give placebo when something better than placebo is available.\" \"The standard of care changes over time as new drugs or drug combinations that are shown to be better become available,\" says Cortazar. The FDA may approve a drug for several uses (indications). If a drug is approved for one indication. it must still be shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective before the FDA will approve it for another indication. In 2006, Erbitux was approved to treat patients with head and neck cancer whose cancer is inoperable. To support a claim to treat colorectal cancer, Erbitux's manufacturer. Recently, a pharmaceutical company requested that the FDA approve its drug for a second indication without conducting additional clinical trials to show an effect on cancer in this new indication. The FDA usually requires randomized clinical trials for diseases that affect a large number of people. Abraxis stated that its drug contained the same active ingredient as Taxol, a cancer drug approved both for metastatic breast cancer and for adjuvant treatment for breast cancer, the indication for which Abraxis was seeking approval. The FDA told the ODAC that Taxol and Abraxane were distinctly different. \"The two drugs have different formulations and different infusion rates,\" said Richard Pazdur, M.D., director of the FDA's Office of Oncology Drug Products. \"They have different toxicity profiles. A cancer drug may be considered effective if it extends a person's life (survival). increases the probability that a person will remain alive without the disease getting worse (progression-free survival). In short, FDA cancer drug reviewers ask, \"Does the drug prolong life, control the disease, or relieve symptoms1 And does the scientific evidence support it?\" These benefits are weighed against the risks of the drug. No drug is absolutely safe—all have some risks, or potential side effects. \"Unfortunately, most of the drugs used to treat cancer aren't targeted,\" says Cortazar. The death of rapidly dividing healthy cells weakens the body's immune system, putting a person at risk for infections and other health problems. Yet highly toxic effects may be considered acceptable if the benefits are important and the disease is very serious or life-threatening.

Who is a Candidate for Herceptin? What Have Clinical Trials with Herceptin Shown? What Have Clinical Trials with Tykerb Shown? Knowing the results of the test can help physicians and patients determine which treatment options are most likely to be effective. Approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in September 1998, Herceptin has shown great promise in increasing patient survival time and reducing the number of deaths from advanced breast cancer. These reactions were not observed in clinical trials prior to FDA approval. However, warning labels accompanying Herceptin packaging have since been amended to include these possible effects. These symptoms were treatable and were not as frequent after the initial treatment with Herceptin. The 1997 FDA-approval of Tykreb, along with Xeloda reflected more than 16 years of research, including more than 60 clinical trials and research studies. In examining data prior to its approval, the FDA reviewed a study that included 400 women with advanced, HER2 positive breast cancer.

Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, a number of procedures, and surgery. In those with more significant symptoms, medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride. Surgical removal of part of the prostate may be carried out in those who do not improve with other measures. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in males with BPH, the condition does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate. While there is some evidence that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none. If confirmed, this mechanism explains why serum androgen levels do not seem to correlate with BPH and why giving exogenous testosterone would not make much difference.

Invasive therapies The two invasive surgical procedures done for BPH: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): In general prior to emergence of laser technologies, TURP had been considered the gold standard of prostate interventions for people who require a procedure. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. However, after this endoscopic surgery the ejaculations are dry in about 65% of patients, unless a novel, ejaculation preserving, altered technique of TURP is applied. Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. There are two types of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the standard monopolar and the newer bipolar procedure. A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies that included 8924 men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably results in comparable improvements urinary symptoms, as well as a similar erectile function, the incidence of urinary incontinence and the need for retreatment. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects. Minimally invasive therapies Minimally invasive therapies can offer faster recovery compared with traditional prostate surgery. Prostate laser surgery Prostate laser surgery is used to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. The surgeon inserts a scope through the penis tip into the urethra. Different types of prostate laser surgery include: Visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) technique involving the Nd:YAG laser with contact on the prostatic tissue. A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule. Another instrument is then used to cut the prostate tissue into small pieces that are easily removed. HoLEP is largely similar to the HoLAP procedure; the main difference is that instead of ablating the tissue, the laser cuts a portion of the prostate, which is then cut into smaller pieces and flushed with irrigation fluid. Three 2015 reviews found that HoLEP is superior to TURP in some respects and for some patients. Some urologists have studied and published long-term data on the outcomes of these procedures, with data out to five years. Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund. Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT. The catheter is connected to a control box outside of the patient's body and is energized to emit microwave radiation into the prostate to heat the tissue and cause necrosis. It is a one-time treatment that takes approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the system used. Some of the devices incorporate circulating coolant through the treatment area with the intent of preserving the urethra while the microwave energy heats the prostatic tissue surrounding the urethra. Transurethral needle ablation Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA) operates with a different type of energy, radio frequency (RF) energy, but is designed along the same premise as TUMT devices, that the heat the device generates will cause necrosis of the prostatic tissue and shrink the prostate. The TUNA device is inserted into the urethra using a rigid scope much like a cystoscope. The energy is delivered into the prostate using two needles that emerge from the sides of the device, through the urethral wall and into the prostate. The treatment is typically performed in one session, but may require multiple sticks of the needles depending on the size of the prostate. The most recent American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines for the Treatment of BPH from 2018 stated that \"TUNA is not recommended for the treatment of LUTS/BPH\". Water vapor thermal therapy Water vapour thermal therapy (marketed as Rezum) is a newer office procedure for removing prostate tissue using steam. Several studies including a four-year follow-up provided evidence for improvement of BPH symptoms, preserved sexual function, and low surgical retreatment rates. Prostatic urethral lift Prostatic urethral lift (marketed as Urolift) is a procedure for men with urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. It consists of placing small hooks that compress the prostate tissue to open the urinary stream without cutting or removing tissue. This procedure likely improves quality of life without additional negative side effects when compared with a sham surgery. Compared with transurethral resection of the prostate, the standard surgery for treating benign prostatic hyperplasia, this procedure may be less effective in reducing urinary symptoms but may preserve ejaculation and have fewer unwanted effects on erections. Temporary implantable nitinol device Temporary implantable nitinol device (marketed as TIND and iTIND) is a device that is placed in the urethra that, when released, is expanded, reshaping reshaping the urethra and the bladder neck. The American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines for the treatment of BPH from 2018 list minimally invasive therapies including TUMT - but not TUNA - as acceptable alternatives for certain patients with BPH. However, the European Association of Urology (EAU) has - as of 2019 - removed both TUMT and TUNA from its guidelines. Complications of Prostate Surgery The two most feared complications of prostate surgery are erectile dysfunction and stress urinary incontinence. The type of complications depend on the treatment modality used: Urinary incontinence can happen after prostate surgery, especially stress urinary incontinence. The problem is most severe in the first 6 to 12 months after treatment, but usually resolves on its own within this time. If the problem persists, conservative management is the first line treatment. This includes lifestyle modifications, kegel exercises, and bladder training. If medical treatment is not effective, surgery may need to be performed for benign prostatic hyperplasia. Invasive therapies The two invasive surgical procedures done for BPH: Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): In general prior to emergence of laser technologies, TURP had been considered the gold standard of prostate interventions for people who require a procedure. This involves removing (part of) the prostate by inserting a resectoscope (cystoscope) through the urethra. However, after this endoscopic surgery the ejaculations are dry in about 65% of patients, unless a novel, ejaculation preserving, altered technique of TURP is applied. Simple prostatectomy can also be offered to men who have large prostates (>50 grams). This can be done by open technique, laparoscopically, or with robotic assistance. There are two types of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP): the standard monopolar and the newer bipolar procedure. A 2019 Cochrane review of 59 studies that included 8924 men with urinary symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia. This review found that bipolar and monopolar TURP probably results in comparable improvements urinary symptoms, as well as a similar erectile function, the incidence of urinary incontinence and the need for retreatment. However some of the newer methods for reducing the size of an enlarged prostate, have not been around long enough to fully establish their safety or side-effects. Minimally invasive therapies Minimally invasive therapies can offer faster recovery compared with traditional prostate surgery. Prostate laser surgery Prostate laser surgery is used to relieve moderate to severe urinary symptoms caused by prostate enlargement. The surgeon inserts a scope through the penis tip into the urethra. Different types of prostate laser surgery include: Visual laser ablation of the prostate (VLAP) technique involving the Nd:YAG laser with contact on the prostatic tissue. A laser is used to melt away (vaporize) excess prostate tissue and enlarge the urinary channel. It is used to vaporize the tissue to the prostatic capsule. Another instrument is then used to cut the prostate tissue into small pieces that are easily removed. HoLEP can be an option for men who have a severely enlarged prostate and is the only prostate size-independent treatment option approved by the American Urologic Association. HoLEP is largely similar to the HoLAP procedure; the main difference is that instead of ablating the tissue, the laser cuts a portion of the prostate, which is then cut into smaller pieces and flushed with irrigation fluid. Three 2015 reviews found that HoLEP is superior to TURP in some respects and for some patients. Some urologists have studied and published long-term data on the outcomes of these procedures, with data out to five years. Since 1996, other companies have received FDA approval for TUMT devices, including Urologix, Dornier, Thermatrix, Celsion, and Prostalund. Multiple clinical studies have been published on TUMT.

The problem is most severe in the first 6 to 12 months after treatment, but usually resolves on its own within this time. If the problem persists, conservative management is the first line treatment. This includes lifestyle modifications, kegel exercises, and bladder training. The underlying mechanism involves the prostate pressing on the urethra thereby making it difficult to pass urine out of the bladder. Treatment options include lifestyle changes, medications, a number of procedures, and surgery. In those with more significant symptoms, medications may include alpha blockers such as terazosin or 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride. Surgical removal of part of the prostate may be carried out in those who do not improve with other measures. Although prostate specific antigen levels may be elevated in males with BPH, the condition does not increase the risk of prostate cancer. On the other hand, some studies suggest that administering exogenous testosterone is not associated with a significant increase in the risk of BPH symptoms, so the role of testosterone in prostate cancer and BPH is still unclear. Further randomized controlled trials with more participants are needed to quantify any risk of giving exogenous testosterone. Therapy with a 5α-reductase inhibitor markedly reduces the DHT content of the prostate and, in turn, reduces prostate volume and BPH symptoms. One small study has shown that medical castration lowers the serum and prostate hormone levels unevenly, having less effect on testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels in the prostate. While there is some evidence that estrogen may play a role in the cause of BPH, this effect appears to be mediated mainly through local conversion of androgens to estrogen in the prostate tissue rather than a direct effect of estrogen itself. In canine in vivo studies castration, which significantly reduced androgen levels but left estrogen levels unchanged, caused significant atrophy of the prostate. Studies looking for a correlation between prostatic hyperplasia and serum estrogen levels in humans have generally shown none. If confirmed, this mechanism explains why serum androgen levels do not seem to correlate with BPH and why giving exogenous testosterone would not make much difference. Men older than 60 in rural areas had very low rates of clinical BPH, while men living in cities and consuming more animal protein had a higher incidence. In a large prospective cohort study in the US (the Health Professionals Follow-up Study), investigators reported modest associations between BPH (men with strong symptoms of BPH or surgically confirmed BPH) and total energy and protein, but not fat intake. Degeneration Benign prostatic hyperplasia is an age-related disease. Misrepair-accumulation aging theory suggests that development of benign prostatic hyperplasia is a consequence of fibrosis and weakening of the muscular tissue in the prostate. Pathophysiology As men age, the enzymes aromatase and 5-alpha reductase increase in activity. (Carcinoma of the prostate typically occurs in the posterior lobe – hence the ability to discern an irregular outline per rectal examination). :694 In BPH, the majority of growth occurs in the transition zone (TZ) of the prostate.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, while what we eat is important, a growing body of research suggests when we eat matters too. While you have likely heard of the circadian rhythm, the master \"clock\" in the brain that governs our sleep-wake cycle, we actually have a variety of circadian clocks that govern the daily cycle of activity for every organ. These rhythms exist because every organ needs downtime for repair and regeneration. Even our gut microbiome operates on a daily rhythm. Circadian clocks optimize our health by aligning our biological functions with regular and predictable environmental patterns. Disrupting our circadian clocks — such as by skipping breakfast or eating at midnight — can result in health issues such as weight gain, metabolic syndrome, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and more. About 20 to 30 percent of American adults skip breakfast. Some do it to save time, many do it in an effort to lose weight. However, studies show that people who eat breakfast daily are less likely to be obese, malnourished, suffer from impaired blood sugar metabolism, or be diagnosed with diabetes. They are also less likely to have the heart disease risk factors of high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Even the American Heart Association recently endorsed biologically appropriate meal timing to reduce the risk of heart disease. Just eating breakfast isn't the only important thing however. The timing in relation to the size of our meals is also important. This is partially because insulin, a hormone that helps with blood sugar control, appears to be most efficient in the morning. In addition, we burn more calories and digest food more efficiently in the morning than later in the day when most of us eat our largest meal. According to the researchers, a high‐calorie breakfast and a reduced calorie dinner is beneficial and might be a useful alternative for managing obesity and metabolic syndrome. Most of us eat meals and snack from the time we wake up until shortly before bed — or even in the middle of the night. Researchers put a group of prediabetic men through two eating cycles. Then in another phase, they ate the same meals in a time-restricted six-hour window starting in the morning. At night, the lack of sunlight signals our brain to release melatonin, the hormone that prepares us for sleep. In the morning, the light stops melatonin production and we wake up. When we change that signaling — whether from a late-night meal, artificial lighting at night (especially blue screen light), shift work, flying and travel, or changing our eating patterns — it confuses our bodies' circadian clocks. Shift workers, who account for about 20 percent of the country’s work force, have a particular problem with disturbed circadian clocks. Many frequently work overnight shifts, forcing them to eat and sleep at odd times. Nighttime shift work has been linked to increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. Studies have linked poor melatonin activity and disrupted sleep-wake cycles with increased risk of dementia and Alzheimer's, cancer, autoimmune flare-ups, obesity, and more. Make breakfast your largest meal and make dinner your smallest. While this may prove difficult for those with a busy social life or family that sits down to a big dinner every evening, make the evening meal smaller whenever possible. Prioritize protein and healthy fats with breakfast, and minimize sugar and caffeine intake especially before lunch, to stabilize blood sugar and regulate metabolism. Avoid between-meal snacks and bedtime goodies. Try time-restricted eating pattern, or intermittent fasting, to maximize weight management. Instead, have your dinners earlier and make them relatively light. The take-home message here is like the old proverb, \"Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper.\" However, a new study on how the time of day affects autoimmune symptoms could offer new ways of treating this complex and increasingly common group of diseases. According to new research, there may be ties to the body’s internal clocks that have a huge impact on severity of both symptoms and the disease itself. Our immune system bases its activity partially on our internal clocks, so it is no surprise that autoimmune diseases do so as well. According to a new study, this timing may be more important in autoimmune disease than we previously believed. Could Molecular Clocks Contribute to Autoimmune Disease? This is not the first study to find that internal clocks are linked to both risk and severity of autoimmune disease. In fact, there is a new field called chronoimmunology dedicated to the study of how immune systems affect and are affected by timing and clocks. Previous studies have found that young adults who work odd shifts, for example, have a higher risk of developing an autoimmune disease later in life. In balanced amounts, our clocks maintain balanced immune activity. Maintain a stable schedule, including keeping roughly the same eating, waking and sleeping times every day. Get ample amounts of natural light exposure during the day but limit lights—especially from screens—during the night. Prepare for changes in your daily schedule, such as daylight savings time or travel, by slowly changing your routine to the new one. Consider taking a melatonin supplement if sleep remains elusive. In addition, maintaining a healthy and well-regulated circadian rhythm is important to your health in a variety of other ways. Keeping your circadian rhythm steady and ticking along is one of the best ways to encourage whole body health and wellness. Parkinson's Disease and Sleep Disorders: Can Melatonin Help? Multiple studies show a dose-response relationship between sedentary time and all-cause mortality with an increase of 3% mortality per additional sedentary hour each day. This study was performed at the University of Sydney’s NHMRC Centre for Integrated Research and Understanding of Sleep or CIRUS. Dr. Craig Philips also added that though the results need to be confirmed through much bigger study. He also said that there might be an influence in the body clock in this issue as it has the tendency or the urge to push the blood fat levels during these times in the wee hours of midnight. He also said that the workers who have night shift jobs are more prone to such cardiovascular conditions. Rania Paula, Author of this article writes for www.ehealthyblog.com.

As this all seems pretty bad, what are the chances you will get Insomnias? It overall depends on your stressing levels, sleeps habits, and agings. In the end around 35% of Americans have Insomnia. Previous studies by a research group at the University of Geneva demonstrated a role for glucocorticoids in shifting the biological clock, and characterized this effect in the liver. For example, at some point in the time zone transition, your brain might be in the time zone of Sydney, Australia; your heart in Hawaii; and your liver still in Los Angeles. It is important to note that approximately 16 percent of the U.S. and European workforces undertake some form of shift work. Further, this response is likely to be time-of-day specific, and the phase response curve to medium treatment that the authors generated in vitro would also predict at what time of the 24-hour day such shifts might occur. The work was funded by grants from the American Heart Association and the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.

Nearly 50 Percent of Patients Have Inadequate Response to H1-antihistamines, Previously the Only Approved Therapy for CIU3. Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. The new use is for people 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines. Xolair is approved for people 12 years and older with CIU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Xolair is not used to treat other forms of urticaria (hives) and is not for use in children less than 12 years of age. It is jointly developed by Genentech and Novartis Pharma AG and is co-promoted in the U.S. with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The efficacy and safety profile of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was evaluated in two clinical studies called ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II(5) . In these studies, patients 12 to 75 years old received doses of Xolair at 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo(5) . Xolair or placebo was given every four weeks for 24 weeks (ASTERIA I) and 12 weeks (ASTERIA II). In addition, patients continued to receive H(1) -antihistamine medicines they had been taking for CIU before starting treatment with Xolair(5) . The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) . Also, a larger proportion of patients (36 percent) treated with Xolair 300 mg reported no itch and no hives at Week 12, compared to patients treated with Xolair 150 mg (15 percent), and patients in the placebo group (9 percent)(5) . The most common side effects in patients treated with Xolair were nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection(5) . moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma who have had a skin or blood test that is positive for allergic asthma and whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1-antihistamine treatment. Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria (hives), acute bronchospasm (serious and sudden breathing problems) or status asthmaticus (acute, severe, prolonged asthma attack that can be life threatening).

Allergy 2011; 66: 317–330. Novartis AG. \"Press Release: Novartis' Xolair Recommended in New Global Chronic Urticaria Guideline\". A new global guideline on chronic urticaria (CU) recommends Xolair® (omalizumab), indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), for patients who are not responding to antihistamines,. Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate. Xolair is the only biologic shown to be effective in CSU.\" Patients treated with Xolair for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements in quality of life by 78% (vs placebo 44%, p<0.0001) as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In addition, data show that almost 90% of CSU patients who responded well to initial Xolair treatment regained symptom control within 12 weeks of Xolair retreatment following a treatment interruption, based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) criteria (UAS7<=6). Also, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma. Xolair is a targeted therapy that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). In allergic diseases and asthma, the binding of IgE by Xolair reduces symptoms by suppressing multiple cell activation mechanisms, including some that result in histamine release. Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanism of action of Xolair in CSU, which could lead to a deeper understanding of how the disease develops. Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005 and has over 800,000 patient years of exposure. In the US, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Novartis is a global leader in Immunology & Dermatology. Other key brands include Xolair® (omalizumab) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), Zortress®/Certican® (everolimus) and Myfortic® (mycophenolic acid) in transplant and Ilaris® (canakinumab), approved to treat several rare diseases including some Periodic Fever Syndromes.

It is aimed at stimulating resistance to respiratory syncytial virus infection, targeting both adult and infant populations. 2016 saw the company's first phase III trial, the 12,000 adult Resolve trial, for its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, which would come to be known as ResVax, fail in September. A drug already used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma appears to offer relief to people with chronic hives who haven't been helped by standard medications, new research suggests. The prescription drug -- omalizumab (Xolair) -- is already available to treat hives, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year for that use. \"And until now antihistamines have been the only approved drug for chronic hives. But to work, antihistamines often need to be used at up to four times approved levels, which has a sedating effect. So then we would turn to the heavy artillery, like [the immunosuppressant drug] cyclosporine, which also has very severe side effects, and can't be taken by people with high blood pressure or heart disease.\" \"All this means that many, many patients have simply been left without any treatment,\" she noted. \"But with this drug we are seeing great improvement in patients who previously had no options. The current study is the latest in a series of ongoing studies, which are being funded by drug manufacturer Genentech Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG in Basel Switzerland. The team found that by the 12th week, people given Xolair showed a marked reduction in their overall number of hives, hive intensity and itching severity, compared with patients who got the dummy treatment. Symptom relief was maintained through the six-month mark, and the authors determined that those treated with the highest (300 mg) dosage of Xolair saw the biggest improvement.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

CBD is a cannabinoid molecule produced by cannabis. Unlike THC, which is the most common cannabinoid, CBD is non-intoxicating. It also has significant pain relief, anti-inflammatory, and anti-anxiety properties, which offer a wide range of possible medicinal applications. CBD is usually administered orally in oil form to control seizures and can be given as drops under the tongue or mixed with food. Medical cannabis, a type of marijuana that contains both THC and CBD, has been used successfully to control seizures. Several states have approved the use of medical marijuana for epilepsy, but research is showing that CBD may be more effective than THC at reducing seizure activity. Some types of medical marijuana are low-THC and high-CBD, meaning that they have less of the intoxicating component that causes a “high” and more potentially beneficial CBD. More research is needed to understand exactly how CBD affects the brain, but researchers believe that CBD may control seizures by calming the brain’s abnormal electrical activity and chemical processes. Animal studies have shown that CBD has an anti-convulsant and neuroprotective effect, which means that it shows promise as a preventative treatment for epilepsy in humans. Although research into the possible applications of CBD for epilepsy treatment is encouraging and ongoing, some parents of children who have epilepsy are not waiting for further research results. Many parents with children who have severe, uncontrolled epilepsy are giving their children CBD now — and some are reporting life-changing results. Scientific researchers have conducted several controlled studies on CBD, meaning that study participants were divided into two or more groups for comparison. One group received a placebo (or a harmless substance that has no therapeutic effect), and the other group received the medication. An open-label study of an oral CBD solution found that of the median reduction in monthly motor seizures was 35.6 percent during the 12-week study. A double-blind, placebo-controlled 14-week trial of 120 children with Dravet syndrome showed that, on average, the frequency of convulsive seizures decreased from 12.4 per month to 5.9 per month after CBD treatment. Five percent of patients became seizure-free after using CBD, while none became seizure-free after using the placebo. The first trial, which included 171 patients, found that patients treated with CBD experienced a 44-percent average reduction of drop seizures. The second trial divided participants into two different dosage groups for CBD, as well as one placebo group. The study found that both of the CBD groups experienced a significant reduction in the average monthly frequency of drop seizures. In a survey conducted in Mexico on 43 children with epilepsy, 81.3 percent of parents whose children used CBD reported a decrease in convulsions. Not only are parents reporting a reduction in their children’s seizures after CBD therapy, but they also are reporting a better quality of life, including improved social interactions, memory, behavior, and energy. Another survey of the parents of 19 children who were using CBD-enriched cannabis, 16 parents (84 percent) reported a reduction in their child’s seizure frequency. As research into CBD for epilepsy treatment continues, studies will look at exactly how CBD impacts the brain. Researchers also will try to determine effective dosing and strength guidelines for epilepsy treatment using CBD and will look at whether CBD interacts with other anti-seizure medications. But, for people with uncontrolled epilepsy who are out of treatment options, CBD may offer a way to control seizures — as well as a chance at an improved quality of life. ABSTRACT: Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are severe epileptic encephalopathies that manifest during early childhood. While multiple pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions exist, careful selection of therapy is paramount as some medications can exacerbate seizures. With the recent approval of Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut or Dravet syndrome, providers and patients have an additional therapeutic option to consider. Within this context, pharmacists have a vital role in educating providers, caregivers, and patients on medication therapy. Cannabis has been used for over 4,000 years with varied success to treat ailments including chronic pain, eating disorders, rheumatism, and convulsions. In the 19th century, neurologists noted the potential effectiveness of cannabis for treating seizure disorders.34 Research since has continued to evaluate cannabis as a treatment option for epilepsy. Multiple randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials found significant improvement of seizure control when patients were treated with CBD in addition to their standard epilepsy treatment. Children and adults with DS and refractory seizures receiving CBD (20 mg/kg/day) for 14 weeks exhibited a 52% reduction in seizure frequency compared to a modest 5% reduction with placebo (P = .01).38 In fact, 5% of these patients in the treatment group were seizure-free (P = .08).38 Similarly, in another study, addition of CBD (20 mg/kg) in patients with LGS and other refractory seizures resulted in a 43.9% median reduction of drop seizures in comparison with a 21.8% reduction with placebo addition.39 A third trial evaluating CBD in patients on standard epilepsy treatment showed 41.9% and 37.2% reduction in drop seizure frequencies over a 14-week treatment period with doses of 20 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg twice a day, respectively, compared with 17.2% in the placebo group. In these studies, adverse effects noted included decreased appetite, diarrhea, vomiting, fatigue, pyrexia, somnolence, and abnormal liver-function tests.38-40 Drug interactions that may require monitoring and dose adjustment included valproic acid and clobazam.38-40 These results highlight the potential of cannabidiol as an adjunctive treatment for DS, LGS, and other refractory seizures. Patients with refractory seizures such as DS and LGS are at an increased risk for medication errors for reasons including complex medication regimens and increased transitions of care.43 As pharmacotherapy experts, pharmacists can play a major role in ensuring safe and effective therapy for patients by educating providers on appropriate medication choices and doses; evaluating patients’ medication regimen for contraindications, drug interactions, and adverse effects; ensuring that medication reconciliation is conducted carefully; and accurately providing education and counseling on medication therapy to patients and family members.

As NAE related Cannabis has an ancient tradition of usage as a medicine in obstetrics and gynecology, its extracts, may represent an efficacious and safe alternative for treatment of a wide range of conditions in women including dysmenorrhea, dysuria, hyperemesis gravidarum, and \n\n Female cannabis plants contain at least 113 cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD), thought to be the major anticonvulsant that helps people with multiple sclerosis; and cannabichromene (CBC), an anti-inflammatory which may contribute to the pain-killing effect of cannabis. It takes over one hour for Marinol to reach full systemic effect, compared to seconds or minutes for smoked or vaporized cannabis. Mark Kleiman, director of the Drug Policy Analysis Program at UCLA's School of Public Affairs said of Marinol, \"It wasn't any fun and made the user feel bad, so it could be approved without any fear that it would penetrate the recreational market, and then used as a club with which to beat back the advocates of whole cannabis as a medicine.\" Clinical trials comparing the use of cannabis extracts with Marinol in the treatment of cancer cachexia have demonstrated equal efficacy and well-being among subjects in the two treatment arms. United States federal law currently registers dronabinol as a Schedule III controlled substance, but all other cannabinoids remain Schedule I, except synthetics like nabilone and HU-308. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has officially approved a drug called Epidiolex which contains cannabidiol (CBD). The preparation in form of strawberry syrup will be used in the treatment of patients with epileptic syndromes (dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome) between 2 years old and older. “This is an important advancement in the treatment of children’s epilepsy,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Scott Gottlieb on Monday. “Due to the efficacy and safety of the use of Epidiolex confirmed in clinical trials in patients, an official agreement was finally approved on the possibility of using this drug in the treatment of certain types of epilepsy,” adds Gottlieb. On the website of the producer, a biopharmaceutical company GW Pharmaceuticals dealing with the discovery, development, and commercialization of new drugs, Epidiolex is the first (available by medical prescription) pharmaceutical formulation containing a high content of purified cannabidiol (CBD) of plant origin that does not cause intoxicating. “The approval of Epidiolex is a milestone in the use of a cannabidiol for the treatment of neurological disorders. This is the first and so far the only CBD drug that can be used to treat two types of epilepsy in children. We would like to say that we have high hopes for the introduction of Epidiolex for medical treatment, “ said Justin Gover, CEO of GW. “The FDA approval of our drug is the culmination of the long-term cooperation of GW Pharmaceuticals with patients, their families, and doctors to develop a new preparation that would be helpful in the fight against epilepsy. Patients deserve it and soon will have access to a CBD-containing drug that has been thoroughly tested in clinical trials, meets all the pharmaceutical product quality criteria and will be available as a prescription from a doctor “ – Justin Gover. “In my medical practice, I had many patients who suffered from drug-resistant epilepsy. In such patients, the treatment regimens used so far most often did not bring the expected results, which is why these patients often asked about the possibility of using CBD “ – said Dr. Orrin Devinsky of the Epileptic Treatment Center at NYU Langone Health, and also one of the main clinical trial managers of Epidiolex. Elizabeth Thiele, director of the pediatric clinic at the General Hospital in Massachusetts, professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief scientist in clinical trials with the drug Epidiolex mentions that the Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet teams are two of the most difficult to control forms of pediatric epilepsy. “These children and their families face a long and difficult path, and very few achieve adequate seizure control. This drug supplements a specific pharmacological gap dedicated to a specific population of pediatric patients and is now the first that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Dravet syndrome. The clinical trial program for Epidiolex included three randomized, double-blind clinical trials and an open-label extension study. From articles published in the New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet scientific journals, it appears that the addition of Epidiolex to other anti-epileptic therapies has resulted in a significant reduction in seizure frequency in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases which is maybe because the PCR test that was used is deffective. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. A 14-day preventive house quarantine was introduced for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases. After the World Health Organization (WHO) has established that COVID-19 is more resilient than the initial data was showing, the National Crisis-management Staff increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. Background A National Crisis-management Staff was formed by the Bulgarian government on 5 March to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. He is a stomach surgeon and epidemiology is not among his specialties. On 23 March a separate Medical Council for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic was appointed by the Prime Minister. Timeline March 8 March On 8 March 2020, Bulgaria confirmed its first two cases, a 27-year-old man from Pleven and a 75-year-old woman from Gabrovo. Neither of the two reported having traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. On the same day, the hospital in Gabrovo requested additional personnel from other hospitals in the country, as it only had three communicable diseases specialists. All of its internal medicine specialists have been quarantined after one of the four initial cases was confirmed to be a nurse at the hospital. The origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and the Ministry of Interior is tracking down all individuals who have been in contact with the patients. 10 March Two additional cases were confirmed in Sofia on 10 March 2020: a 74-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife. Both have arrived from Lom two weeks prior to admission. 11 March A suspected case of a 33-year-old man was reported by the Saint George Hospital in Plovdiv on 11 March. The same day, a 40-year-old woman in Varna showed COVID-19 symptoms on CT scan, although regional health authorities have not yet confirmed the case. Many of these had been in contact with the elderly couple admitted to the Pirogov Hospital on 10 March. There were 13 breaches of quarantine; patients involved were returned to treatment facilities and warned of repercussions, including fines and prison sentences. The second victim of the virus was the 74-year-old husband of the first victim. Late in the evening on 31 March a member of parliament was tested positive for the virus. In Varna, one test out of 12 samples proved positive.

Background On 31 December 2019, the Health Commission of Wuhan, Hubei, China, informed the WHO about a cluster of acute pneumonia cases with unknown origin in its province. On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) reported the identification of a novel coronavirus (later identified as the SARS-CoV-2) as the cause. The disease in China affected over 80,000 people, causing over 3,200 deaths (as of March 25, 2020) and has now spread to over 210 countries and territories across the world. A 62-year-old man from Italy entered the country on 22 February and fell ill on 24 February, when he was transferred to Ramón Lara military hospital from the beach resort of Bayahibe. On 6 March, the second case in the country was confirmed as a Canadian tourist (also vacationing in Bayahibe) was detected. Local transmission The first documented case of local transmission seems to have originated from a 56-year old Dominican woman from the town of Villa Riva on Duarte Province who had traveled from Italy to the Dominican Republic on 26 February 2020. The woman refused to be sent to Santo Domingo to be in isolation after receiving her COVID-19 positive diagnosis, returning to her home instead.

Neither of the two had traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases which is maybe because the PCR test that was used is deffective. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. A 14-day preventive house quarantine was introduced for citizens who have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient or have returned from an overseas region with a high number of cases. For patients tested positive for the virus a 21-day house quarantine was introduced. After the World Health Organization (WHO) has established that COVID-19 is more resilient than the initial data was showing, the National Crisis-management Staff increased the recovery house quarantine by a week to 28 days. Background A National Crisis-management Staff was formed by the Bulgarian government on 5 March to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. He is a stomach surgeon and epidemiology is not among his specialties. On 23 March a separate Medical Council for dealing with the coronavirus pandemic was appointed by the Prime Minister. Timeline March 8 March On 8 March 2020, Bulgaria confirmed its first two cases, a 27-year-old man from Pleven and a 75-year-old woman from Gabrovo. Neither of the two reported having traveled to areas with known coronavirus cases. The man tested positive for the virus after being hospitalized for a respiratory infection, and authorities announced plans to test several people who were in contact with the two individuals. On the same day, the hospital in Gabrovo requested additional personnel from other hospitals in the country, as it only had three communicable diseases specialists. All of its internal medicine specialists have been quarantined after one of the four initial cases was confirmed to be a nurse at the hospital. The origin of the outbreak remains unknown, and the Ministry of Interior is tracking down all individuals who have been in contact with the patients. 10 March Two additional cases were confirmed in Sofia on 10 March 2020: a 74-year-old man and his 66-year-old wife. Both have arrived from Lom two weeks prior to admission. 11 March A suspected case of a 33-year-old man was reported by the Saint George Hospital in Plovdiv on 11 March. The same day, a 40-year-old woman in Varna showed COVID-19 symptoms on CT scan, although regional health authorities have not yet confirmed the case. Many of these had been in contact with the elderly couple admitted to the Pirogov Hospital on 10 March. There were 13 breaches of quarantine; patients involved were returned to treatment facilities and warned of repercussions, including fines and prison sentences. The second victim of the virus was the 74-year-old husband of the first victim. Late in the evening on 31 March a member of parliament was tested positive for the virus. In Varna, one test out of 12 samples proved positive. These are China, Iran, Bangladesh, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Spain, Italy, South Korea, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. The number of total cases rose to 62, including two British citizens vacationing in Bansko. 17 March 81 cases were reported, several linked to an outbreak in Bansko. 18 March The total number of cases increased to 94 by 18 March, with new cases appearing in Smolyan, Veliko Tarnovo and Pernik among recent arrivals from outside the country.

Banteay Meanchey has the second-highest number of infections, whereas Kandal has second-highest number of deaths. According to Global Health Security Index's report in 2019, Cambodia ranked 89th out of 195 countries in preparedness for infectious disease outbreak. On 29 November, the first community transmission cluster was detected in Phnom Penh, with the virus suspected to have entered the country sometime during October and circulated undetected. Cambodia reported its first death on 11 March 2021. Background On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. on 27 January, the first case had been confirmed in Sihanoukville on a 60-year-old Chinese man who arrived in 23 January from Wuhan, Hubei with his family. Three other members of his family were placed under quarantine as they did not appear to have symptoms, while he was placed in a separate room at the Preah Sihanouk Referral Hospital. On 10 February, after two weeks of being treated and kept under observation, he had fully recovered, Health Ministry stated on account of testing negative for the third time by Pasteur Institute of Cambodia. The family were finally discharged and flew back to their home country on the next day as of the 80 Chinese nationals who arrived in Sihanoukville on the same flight as him, most have since returned to China, although the city of Wuhan remains under quarantine. The Westerdam arrived in Sihanoukville on 13 February after it had been turned away by four countries due to virus concerns. No officials or passengers implemented social distancing or mask wearing during the ceremony, and passengers were later encouraged to tour around Phnom Penh. Of 145 Westerdam passengers who stopped in Malaysia by plane on 15 February, an 83-year-old American woman tested positive for the virus, leading to concern that other passengers may also have been infected. By only then, the remaining of 781 passengers were isolated and taken clinical tests, and still, the Westerdam was criticized as it was not designed for quarantine and the passengers were able to socialize. 1-15 March 2020 - imported cases On 7 March, the second case of the coronavirus was detected in a 38-year-old man, a Cambodian in Siem Reap. He was among four people (three of the man's relatives and a Japanese woman) placed under quarantine at Siem Reap Provincial Referral Hospital, all of whom had direct contact with a Japanese man in his 40s who left Cambodia on 3 February and tested positive upon arrival in his country at Chubu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname, Aichi. Meanwhile, some 40 other people in the same city had been isolated under medical supervision since indirect contacts with the same Japanese man. At 4:30p.m., a 65-year-old British woman had tested positive for the virus in Kampong Cham.

Madad is the Senior Director of the System-wide Special Pathogens Program at NYC Health + Hospitals where she is part of the executive leadership team which oversees New York City's response to the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in the city's 11 public hospitals. Madad's interest in public health and infectious disease began at a young age, including after she saw the 1995 film Outbreak. During her tenure, she has overseen responses to Ebola virus disease, Zika fever, and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Madad and Klain advocated for Congress to ensure the full network of healthcare institutions remains funded to protect against future outbreaks. Their warning came just months before COVID-19 reached the United States. As the COVID-19 pandemic was unfolding, Madad emphasized the need to monitor the situation and the available research around the pandemic's trajectory and effective approaches to mitigation. As COVID-19 made its way to New York City, Madad oversaw trainings and simulations to prepare healthcare workers for the coming demands that would be placed on the healthcare system. She also instituted respiratory stations at the entrance of hospitals, which ask incoming patients if they have a fever, cough, or rash to take a mask and sanitize their hands immediately. In May 2021, her opinion article, \"Why Are So Many of My Fellow Health Workers Unvaccinated?\" Madad is on the faculty of the United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Emerging Special Pathogen Training and Education Center's (NETEC), formerly called National Ebola Training and Education Center, funded by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Public appearances\nOn January 24, 2020, Netflix released the documentary series Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak, which followed Madad in her role at the Special Pathogens Program working to prevent an outbreak from occurring and prepare healthcare workers in the event that one does. The film portrays her working to secure funding and preparing personnel in the event of an outbreak. The series was filmed in 2019 and was based on the premise that the world is due for another deadly pandemic. Filming preceded the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which did not reach Madad's jurisdiction in New York City until March 2020. Since the release of the series and the emergence of New York City as the worst hit locality of the COVID-19 pandemic, Madad has discussed the outbreak and pandemic preparedness on outlets, such as CNN, Fox News, Good Morning America, MSNBC, and CNBC.

WASHINGTON — Scientists and politicians are clashing over the value of using “humanized mice” implanted with tissue harvested from aborted babies’ organs in ongoing federally funded research. By contrast, a leading stem-cell researcher last week told a congressional hearing considering axing about $100 million in federal grants to scientists performing research with fetal remains that using tissue from aborted babies is “antiquated” and unnecessary. Prentice described the case of Allison Carr, a multiple sclerosis patient whose doctors told her she would be completely disabled and on a feeding tube within five years. German doctors genetically corrected his stem cells and grew a new skin layer, which, grafted onto the boy’s body, allowed him to grow his own new healthy skin. The cell lines are controversial because they were drawn from aborted fetuses in the ’60s and ’70s. ABR, a primary culler of human tissue from aborted fetuses for decades, has purchased aborted tissue from Planned Parenthood. ABR employees featured in the extensive video footage captured in 2015 by the pro-life Center for Medical Progress. The group released clandestinely taped abortionists discussing details, Planned Parenthood Federation of America officials negotiating fees, and fetal-tissue procurers and sellers, including two women from ABR, discussing the trade in aborted babies’ intact hearts, brains, eyes, liver and thymus for profit, including from government contracts. The videos circulated internationally and sparked an uproar over the fetal-tissue trade, though little was accomplished under the Obama administration to rein it in. Pro-lifers have had several wins in stemming the trade in the past two years, however. Meadows concluded the meeting by asking Temple and the other witnesses to return to the committee in 30 days with three recommendations to look at research using non-aborted fetuses. The procurement and funding of aborted fetal-tissue research is threatened, but for now it continues, and with the support of NIH Director Collins. But his Dec. 13 remarks supporting such research were criticized strongly by pro-life leaders, who said his position undermined the desire of the Trump administration to bring it to a halt. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.The episode has cast a chill on fetal tissue research in the United States.One institution posted a guard outside a lab where the research was being conducted.Fetal tissue has become harder for scientists to procure.In other countries, the research proceeds apace. Gardner has said that he is pro-life and that abortion laws should be left up to the states. Gardner later said that he changed his mind on personhood after listening to voters. According to The Denver Post, \"Gardner conceded that with \n\nThe recommendation to stop funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood by the House of Representatives Select Investigative Panel holds significance from both a political and ethical standpoint. The panel recommended that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) cease funding fetal tissue research and Planned Parenthood be stripped of U.S. funding. This recommendation aligns with the stance of Republicans who have long sought to block funding for Planned Parenthood due to their provision of abortions, along with birth control and preventive health services. The investigation was prompted by undercover videos released in 2015, where anti-abortion activists posed as biotechnology executives and interviewed senior physicians from Planned Parenthood. These videos revealed the provision of fetal tissue from legal abortions for medical research. Therefore, the recommendation to cease funding fetal tissue research and defund Planned Parenthood raises important questions regarding the future of medical research and the potential impact on the development of new treatments. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. Antiabortion activists recently took their fight beyond the use of fetal cells in vaccine-making, to attack any use of fetal tissue in research.

NLG2101 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of indoximod 1200 mg orally, twice daily in combination with docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly in patients with metastatic ER/PR positive or negative, HER2 negative breast cancer. The trial, which reached its goal of 154 patients enrolled across multiple sites in the United States and Europe, is designed to evaluate the combination of indoximod and chemotherapy as first-line therapy for patients with metastatic breast cancer. The study's primary endpoint is progression-free survival, with secondary endpoints of overall survival, response rate per RECIST 1.1 criteria, safety, and immune response correlative assays. Preliminary evaluable safety data from 128 patients, when considered in a blinded fashion pooling control and treatments arms of the study, suggests that the regimen is generally well tolerated. Additionally, no unexpected safety signals were reported with the combination of indoximod with docetaxel or paclitaxel, suggesting that there is no additional or unique toxicity with the addition of indoximod to chemotherapy. Objective responses were achieved in an earlier Phase 1 trial combining indoximod and docetaxel in patients with metastatic solid tumors, including breast tumors. \"I believe this is an exciting chemoimmunotherapy combination regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer,\" said Shou-Ching Tang, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine, Leader, Breast Cancer Multidisciplinary Team at Augusta University. The data, presented during the poster session \"Treatment: Immunotherapy,\" correspond to the abstract (P2-11-09) entitled, \"A phase 2 randomized trial of the IDO pathway inhibitor indoximod in combination with taxane based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer: preliminary data.\" Indoximod is an orally available small molecule that has shown the potential to interfere with multiple targets within the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway. AMES, Iowa, April 2, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- NewLink Genetics Corporation (NASDAQ: NLNK), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing cancer therapeutics, today announced the initiation of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study of its first IDO (indoleamine-(2,3)-dioxygenase) pathway inhibitor, indoximod, in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The Phase 2 clinical study will evaluate indoximod as a new approach to treating cancer by administering this novel IDO pathway inhibitor, designed to counteract a key mechanism by which tumors evade immune-mediated destruction, in combination with a conventional cytotoxin, docetaxel. Indoximod is the most advanced product candidate to enter clinical trials based on NewLink's proprietary IDO pathway inhibitor platform for small-molecule, orally bioavailable cancer immunotherapies. \"There is significant unmet need for new approaches that may offer more effective treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer, a leading cause of death in women in the United States,\" said Hatem Soliman, MD, a medical oncologist specializing in breast cancer in The Center for Women's Oncology at Moffitt Cancer Center and the principal investigator for this study. \"Indoximod, an IDO pathway inhibitor is an immune check point inhibitor akin to the recently developed antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of indoximod in combination with docetaxel as compared to docetaxel alone in up to 120 patients with metastatic breast cancer. Study endpoints include progression-free survival, objective response rate, median overall survival and evaluation of pharmacodynamic tumor markers, in addition to safety. For more information about the study please refer to www.clinicaltrials.gov. Mechanism of action: Indoximod (1-methyl-d-tryptophan) is a small molecule, methylated tryptophan, anti-immunosuppressive-toleragenic, Indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) pathway inhibitor. A new director for the National Cancer Institute, an early release of data in prostate cancer, disappointing findings in a renal cell carcinoma trial, enrollment paused in 2 multiple myeloma studies, and discontinuation of a phase III colorectal cancer trial. This new protocol revises the planned analyses of the primary and several secondary endpoints, reducing the target patient population to 1440 patients, down from 1560. The FDA approved enzalutamide in 2012 as a treatment for men with late-stage CRPC previously treated with docetaxel. In 2014, the agency approved the drug for first-line therapy based on results from the phase III PREVAIL trial, in which enzalutamide improved OS by 29% and radiographic progression-free survival by 81% compared with placebo. The FDA expanded enzalutamide’s label again in 2016 based on findings from the phase II TERRAIN trial, in which enzalutamide reduced the risk of radiographic progression or death by 40% versus bicalutamide, and improved median rPFS by 6.1 months in patients with metastatic CRPC. In renal cell carcinoma, the combination of dalantercept plus axitinib failed to significantly improve progression-free survival in patients with advanced disease compared with placebo. Frequency of grade 3 or higher adverse events, regardless of causality, were similar between the 2 groups. An external Data Monitoring Committee recommended halting new enrollment while the company collects more data to better understand reported deaths in the pembrolizumab arms. This decision strictly affects KEYNOTE-183 and KEYNOTE-185 and no other pembrolizumab studies. KEYNOTE-183 is comparing the combination of pembrolizumab, pomalidomide, and low-dose dexamethasone with pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who have undergone at least 2 lines of prior treatment. KEYNOTE-185 is comparing pembrolizumab, lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone with lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone alone in patients with newly diagnosed and treatment-naïve multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant. In its statement announcing the decision, XBiotech said its independent data monitoring committee determined that data were not sufficient to meet efficacy or the threshold for continuation. Results from XCITE were presented at the 2016 World Congress of Gastrointestinal Cancer, but even at that time, healthcare professionals questioned the data. The suit was consolidated with another against Quincy Pharmaceuticals, Vanderwerff v.

The SHERLOC study enrolled 109 patients with NSCLC. Objective response rate (ORR), time to progression and overall survival were key secondary endpoints. The patients need to have progressed after one or two lines of prior systemic therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease and have received previous CDK inhibitor-based therapy. Key secondary endpoints are objective response rate, time to progression and overall survival.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Drumming is a complex composite intervention with the potential to modulate specific neuroendocrine and neuroimmune parameters in a direction opposite to that expected with the classic stress response. \"I once worked with a young person with Parkinson's disease who had trouble initiating movement. Drumming is a great workout for your brain and actually can make you smarter because when you drum you access your entire brain. Drumming can have positive effects on your health and may help with many conditions from stress, fatigue, and anxiety, to hypertension, asthma, chronic pain, arthritis, mental illness, addiction, and even cancer. •Barry Bittman, MD, CEO, Mind-Body Wellness Center \"Group drumming from a HealthRHYTHMS perspective is transcendent ... it empowers people to more effectively express themselves, while enabling them to move beyond their perceived limitations and put back into their lives what is missing.\" Jeffrey Ritterman, MD, Kaiser Permanente – \"Many of our patients are socially isolated and the drumming sessions help them feel connected with each other. I would recommend the HealthRHYTHMS protocol to health care providers working with patients in a variety of settings.

You actually learn how to control its movement through the stability of your core muscles. In Pilates, the quality of movement is valued over quantity of repetitions. Some exercises are so precise and controlled doing only a few are all that is needed. Modification to the exercises is key here. Strengthening postural muscles is a key component in Pilates exercises. Sports performance is greatly improved because Pilates builds balanced muscle development, core strength, and flexibility through efficient and purposeful movement. Many conventional workouts practiced by athletes build strength and mass in specific muscle groups but ignore others. The result is muscular imbalance – a primary cause of injury and deteriorating athletic performance. In Pilates, no one muscle group is overly trained. You will learn how to move efficiently–Pilates exercises train several muscle groups at once in smooth, continuous movements. Many of the exercises are performed in reclining or sitting positions, yet are weight bearing to reduce the risk of developing osteoporosis. Pilates is so safe, it is used in physical therapy facilities to rehabilitate injuries. It is also an extremely flexible exercise system. Modifications to the exercises allow for a range of difficulty from beginners, those post-rehab, all the way to advanced practitioners. At each of these levels, the workout is modified to suit you now, and intensity increases as your body conditioning improve. There is nothing specifically different about Pilates training for men, especially in the beginning. The Pilates method is the same for all. Developed on a man’s body, and taught with input from both men and women, Pilates is founded on healthy movement principles for the human body in general. Men might find that their muscles are a little tighter than women’s, especially in the hips and hamstrings, but exercises can be easily modified to allow those areas to stretch out gradually. It is important that your progression follows a safe and effective path to optimize your workout. If you are taking private lessons, or classes, you will work deeper with more control and precision as you progress. Your bones will strengthen, muscles will tone and firm, and you will look fit. But, most of all, as you work out and begin to feel better physically, we hope you will also begin to feel better mentally. Movement in Pilates initiates from your center. Coordinating your breathing is an integral part of most Pilates exercises. Flow – Continuous movement through each exercise with fluidity and grace without wasted or unintentional placement of your body. Transitioning smoothly from one exercise to the next will build stamina and endurance. Classical Pilates is an exercise method developed by Joseph Pilates nearly a century ago. Systematic, sequential order of exercises that focus on flow, which develops endurance and stamina. Exercises are taught with a unique and dynamic rhythm and progression occurs as mastery of the exercises can be done with control and precision.

In the Queen's Birthday Honours list of 2019, Jane was awarded the Order of the British Empire medal for services to \"Human Monoclonal Antibody Drug Research and Development and Biotechnology\". She is married to John Richer, Professor of Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge. She is sister to Professor Anne Osbourn FRS who investigates plant natural product biosynthesis. She then went on to complete a PhD degree at the John Innes Centre for Plant Science Research in Norwich which resulted in the publication of Evidence that nucleocapsid disassembly and a later step in virus replication are inhibited in transgenic tobacco protoplasts expressing TMV coat protein. Following this she completed a post-doctoral position at Rutgers University, New Jersey, undertaking research directed towards clarification of the sequence elements responsible for the translational enhancement effect conferred by the 5' untranslated region of Tobacco Mosaic Virus known as omega. Career in industry\nIn 1993 she moved to a small, Cambridge-based start-up biotechnology company called Cambridge Antibody Technology - a company co-founded by Sir Greg Winter and Dr David Chiswell OBE. CAT, as it was called, would pioneer the use of Phage Display technology that ultimately discovered some of the world's highest selling drugs, for example, Humira. She was the key author of several, high impact scientific papers including Human Antibodies with Sub-nanomolar Affinities Isolated from a Large Non-immunized Phage Display Library, Nature Biotechnology, 1996 and Human Antibodies by Design, Nature Biotechnology, 1998. She has been acknowledged by a number of different pharmaceutical media groups for these qualities. Osbourn has also has previously served as a Member of the UK Medical Research Council Industry Grant Award Assessment Panel. In 2018 the Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded jointly to Sir Greg Winter, George Smith and Frances Arnold. Sir Greg Winter received his award for the phage display of peptides and antibodies. Sir Greg and David Chiswell founded Cambridge Antibody Technology to exploit this science. Osbourn says of this time \"There was a cohort of really able intellect in Cambridge – in CAT and other companies, in the MRC LMB and in the University – and what happened was a condensation of that focus… Once we decided to make phage display work, we set some really tough goals and then just got on with it.\" To recognise Jane’s contribution to the prize, she, along with David Chiswell and John McCafferty accompanied Sir Greg to the Nobel ceremony. On 7 June 2019 she was awarded an OBE for services to Human Monoclonal Antibody Drug Research and Development and Biotechnology.

A general representation of the method used to produce monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb or moAb) are antibodies that are made by identical immune cells that are all clones of a unique parent cell. In contrast, polyclonal antibodies bind to multiple epitopes and are usually made by several different plasma cell (antibody secreting immune cell) lineages. Bispecific monoclonal antibodies can also be engineered, by increasing the therapeutic targets of one single monoclonal antibody to two epitopes. Given almost any substance, it is possible to produce monoclonal antibodies that specifically bind to that substance; they can then serve to detect or purify that substance. This has become an important tool in biochemistry, molecular biology, and medicine. The idea of \"magic bullets\" was first proposed by Paul Ehrlich, who, at the beginning of the 20th century, postulated that, if a compound could be made that selectively targeted a disease-causing organism, then a toxin for that organism could be delivered along with the agent of selectivity. He and Élie Metchnikoff received the 1908 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for this work, which led to an effective syphilis treatment by 1910. While working at the Institute of Experimental Therapy, Ehrlich formed an idea that it could be possible to kill specific microbes that cause diseases without harming the body itself. He named the hypothetical agent as Zauberkugel, the magic bullet. He envisioned that just like a bullet fired from a gun to hit a specific target, there could be a way to specifically target invading microbes. His continued research to discover the magic bullet resulted in further knowledge of the functions of the body's immune system, and in the development of Salvarsan, the first effective drug for syphilis, in 1909. His works were the foundation of immunology, and for his contributions he shared the 1908 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Élie Metchnikoff. He invented the precursor technique to Gram staining bacteria. In immunology, antigens (Ag) are structures specifically bound by antibodies (Ab) or a cell surface version of Ab ~ B cell antigen receptor (BCR). The term antigen originally described a structural molecule that binds specifically to an antibody only in the form of native antigen. It was expanded later to refer to any molecule or a linear molecular fragment after processing the native antigen that can be recognized by T-cell receptor (TCR). Milstein shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1984 with Niels Kaj Jerne and Georges J. F. Köhler. In 1988, Greg Winter and his team pioneered the techniques to humanize monoclonal antibodies, eliminating the reactions that many monoclonal antibodies caused in some patients. Sir Gregory Paul Winter is a Nobel Prize-winning British biochemist best known for his work on the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies. His research career has been based almost entirely at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the MRC Centre for Protein Engineering, in Cambridge, England. He is credited with invented techniques to both humanise (1986) and, later, to fully humanise using phage display, antibodies for therapeutic uses. For these developments Winter was awarded the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with George Smith and Frances Arnold. Polyethylene glycol is used to fuse adjacent plasma membranes, but the success rate is low, so a selective medium in which only fused cells can grow is used. The most productive and stable clone is then selected for future use. One of the advantages of the new technologies is applicable to multiple animals, such as rabbit, llama, chicken and other common experimental animals in the laboratory. In contrast, the in vivo sample is likely to have host antibodies, proteases, nucleases, nucleic acids and viruses. The sample is first conditioned, or prepared for purification. In addition, the concentration of product in the sample may not be sufficient, especially in cases where the desired antibody is produced by a low-secreting cell line. Either cation exchange\n\n  The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (Nobelpriset i fysiologi eller medicin) is awarded annually by the Swedish Karolinska Institute to scientists in the various fields of physiology or medicine. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel (who died in 1896), awarded for outstanding contributions in chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. While commonly referred to as the Nobel Prize in Medicine, Nobel specifically stated that the prize be awarded for \"physiology or medicine\" in his \n\nA collection of information and resources about some of the people whose work has helped build biotechnology into one of the most important tools in our lives today. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work in 2018. These enzymes today are a fundamental tool for many different types of biotechnology, including DNA sequencing and gene cloning. She was also one of the first scientists to isolate and clone virus specific T lymphocytes, laying the foundation for defining different influenza sub-sets and improving vaccines.

This they did by combining a gene for frog ribosomal RNA with a bacterial plasmid which was then put into a strain of E-coli for expression. Based on this technique Boyer helped found Genentech, the first biotechnology company dedicated to commercialising recombinant DNA. This he did in 1976 in collaboration with Robert Swanson. This they did by combining a gene for frog ribosomal RNA with a bacterial plasmid which was then put into a strain of E-coli for expression. The work laid the foundation for the birth of Genentech, the first company dedicated to the commercialisation of recombinant DNA. Together with James Watson, Francis Crick discovered the double-helix structure of DNA. This they did with the help of earlier research by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins. Crick also developed the theoretical framework for understanding how genetic information travels in cells. (Photo credit: MRC, Laboratory of Molecular Biology). Dayhoff is known as the founder of bioinformatics. This she did by pioneering the application of mathematics and computational techniques to the sequencing of proteins and nucleic acids and establishing the first publicly available database for research in the area.

Doudna first made her name uncovering the basic structure and function of the first ribozyme, a type of catalytic ribonucleic acid (RNA) that helps catalyse chemical reactions. In addition to her scientific contributions to CRISPR, Doudna is known for spearheading the public debate to consider the ethical implications of using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit human embryos. In her short life she managed to found and head up numerous companies and held many leadership and sales positions in the biopharmaceutical industry. Her crowning achievement was to be hired by Pfizer to head up its new strategic research and development investments initiative. Green’s enduring patience and strong mentoring skills, together with her passion to develop products to help patients, set her apart from many others in the biotechnology world. She is best known for her pioneering work on the molecular biology of two viruses that cause cancer - the polyomavirus and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). First director of the Basel Institute of Immunology, Jerne's research and theories to explain antibody diversity and formation helped ignite work that laid the foundation for the production of monoclonal antibodies.

Osbourn says of this time \"There was a cohort of really able intellect in Cambridge – in CAT and other companies, in the MRC LMB and in the University – and what happened was a condensation of that focus… Once we decided to make phage display work, we set some really tough goals and then just got on with it.\" To recognise Jane’s contribution to the prize, she, along with David Chiswell and John McCafferty accompanied Sir Greg to the Nobel ceremony. On 7 June 2019 she was awarded an OBE for services to Human Monoclonal Antibody Drug Research and Development and Biotechnology. CEO of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, said of the award \"On behalf of AstraZeneca, I am delighted to congratulate Dr Jane Osbourn for her award of an OBE in recognition of her services to human monoclonal antibody drug research and development and biotechnology. This well-deserved honour reflects her contribution to biopharmaceutical science over more than 25 years, from Cambridge Antibody Technology to AstraZeneca and MedImmune.

It's a common, simple application arising from the scientific field called biophotonics, biomedical photonics or photomedicine, a discipline in which light is at the heart of all research. Science demonstrates that it can. In fact, it is already being done, although we are not always aware of this. \"We are often surrounded by this science without knowing it,\" explains Professor Romain Quidant, head of the Plasmon Nano-Optics Group of the Institute of Photonic Sciences (ICFO) located at the UPC's Baix Llobregat Campus. As its name indicates, biophotonics is a term that encompasses biology, the branch of natural sciences that studies the laws of life, and photonics, that is, the science and technology focusing on generating, manipulating and detecting photons, which are the quantum units of light. Professor Romain Quidant's group is working with gold nanoparticles as tools to manipulate very small biological systems without harming them. According to Professor Turgut Durduran, head of the Medical Optics Group at ICFO, who makes a brief historical summary to attempt to explain where this discipline comes from and where it's going, \"In the 1930s, in some medical consulting rooms where breast cancer was being researched, a light would be placed behind a patient's breast while a doctor stood in front of the patient drawing what he or she saw. Today, 80 years later, in a way, we're still studying that,\" exemplifies the researcher. It is a new science that has experienced significant growth over the past few decades and is now beginning to obtain results in major fields of medicine. To work in the field of photonics, you need a source of light, which can be a microscope light, a laser or radiation invisible to the human eye; then you need a biological system, such as a tissue or cell, on which to work at different levels. At present, such medical fields as dermatology, ophthalmology, surgery, neurology, cardiology and oncology are the areas with the greatest advances in biophotonics. Others are still in the last stage of research. Although this discipline has been evolving since the first quarter of the 20th century, in the general historical context, biophotonics is just getting started. The variety of opportunities offered by light, together with other technologies, open numerous possibilities for medicine in the future. Romain Quidant, an ICREA professor and CELLEX fellow from France, works on pioneering projects in the field of nanophotonics. In his research, he uses both the light and the heat generated by gold nanoparticles (particles of gold of nanometric dimensions). In his light-related research, Quidant is \"developing a chip that could operate as a miniature laboratory in and of itself.\" The researcher explains: \"The idea is to use the latest advances in nano-optics to detect very small quantities of cancer markers in a patient's single drop of blood. Not only biophotonics are involved; we introduce a nanotechnology component as well.\" Quidant uses gold nanoparticles, \"very small objects measuring some 50 nanometers that can be designed to act as an efficient light nanosource.\" His group has managed to concentrate light on a point ten times smaller than allowed by \"the most perfect\" of lenses. It has demonstrated that the control of light on a nanometric scale can be applied in ultrasensitive nanobiosensors and optical tweezers capable of manipulating very small biological systems without harming them. In this case, the heat properties are used in cancer therapy. Once the particles have been introduced, a laser is applied to heat them until the cancerous cells are selectively destroyed,\" explains Quidant. \"First we need to understand how an isolated cell works before we can work on a tumor.\" The research being done by Turgut Durduran and Romain Quidant enjoys the support of the CELLEX foundation in Barcelona. This is the principle of the field in which I'm working: light through tissue\", he explains. One of his projects focuses on non-invasive monitoring of the blood flow and blood oxygen levels in real time using diffuse optics. development of probabilistic weather and climate prediction systems. ; 2015 John Barrow (University of Cambridge) For his combination of mathematical and physical reasoning to increase our understanding of the evolution of the universe, and his use of cosmology to increase our understanding of fundamental physics. ; 2016 Sandu Popescu (University of Bristol) For his fundamental and influential research into nonlocality and his contribution to the foundations of quantum physics. ; 2017 Michael Duff (Imperial College London and Oxford University) For sustained groundbreaking contributions to theoretical physics including the discovery of Weyl anomalies, for having pioneered Kaluza-Klein supergravity, and for recognising that superstrings in 10 dimensions are merely a special \n\n the development of atomic-scale computer simulations, which have greatly extended their power and effectiveness across an immense range of applications. ; 2007 David Sherrington (University of Oxford) For his pioneering work in spin glasses. ; 2008 Bryan Webber (University of Cambridge) For his pioneering work in understanding and applying quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction which is one of the three fundamental forces of Nature. ; 2009 Michael Cates (University of Edinburgh) For pioneering work in the theoretical physics of soft materials, particularly in relation to their flow behaviour. ; 2010 James Binney (University of Oxford) For his contribution to our understanding of how galaxies are constituted, \n\n were overlooked for the prize in physics such as G.Fr.FitzGerald, H.A.Rowland, G.Stokes, J.W.Gibbs, Ot.W.v.Struve, Al.St.Popov, P.Drude, P.J.C.Janssen, Ch.Aug.Young, H.Minkowski, W.Ritz, S.Newcomb, G.V.Schiaparelli, G.J.Stoney, Osb.Reynolds, Fr.C.Alw.Pockels, V.Schumann, N.Umov, K.Schwarzschild, P.Lowell, Ernst Pringsheim Sr., M.Smoluchowski, W.Voigt, J.N.Lockyer, M.Abraham, Al.Friedmann, G.Wulff, Ant. van den Broek, F.Kurlbaum, Em.Wiechert, R.Pictet, B.Rosing, P.Ehrenfest, W.de Sitter, P.Knipping, L.Shubnikov, brothers Edw.Ch. and W.H.Pickering, M.P.Bronstein, Ett.Majorana, Edw.Hall, S.P.Schubin, D.S.Roschdestwenski, Ol.Lodge, J.Larmor, R.H.Fowler, G.W.Ritchey, J.Jeans, J.Ishiwara, N.Dm.Papaleksi, R.Ch.Tolman, A.H.Pfund, W.

The many disadvantages include sample deterioration, cost, lengthy waiting times (even for urgent cases), inaccurate results for small sample quantities, difficulties in integrating parameters obtained by a wide variety of methods and poor standardisation of sample collection. Steadily, miniaturisation, parallelisation and integration of different functions on a single device, based on techniques derived from the electronics industry, have led to the development of a new generation of devices that are smaller, faster and cheaper, do not require special skills, and provide accurate readings. These analytical devices require much smaller samples and will deliver more complete (and more accurate) biological data from a single measurement. Nanotechnology enables further refinement of diagnostic techniques, leading to high throughput screening (to test one sample for numerous diseases, or screen large numbers of samples for one disease) and ultimately point-of-care diagnostics. Molecular imaging and image guided therapy is now a basic tool for monitoring disease and in developing almost all the applications of in-vivo NanoMedicine. Key attributes of biosensors are their specificity and sensitivity. The ability to trace the distribution of a drug leads to the possibility of activating it only where needed, thus reducing the potential for toxicity. Research is needed to improve the efficiency and reliability of detection systems. Combining different imaging modalities is a promising approach; for example, positron emission tomography with magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance imaging with ultrasound or with electroencephalogram-based brain mapping, ultrasound with optical technologies and will lead to the possibility of benefiting from the advantages of each system. In principle, this will require use of fluorescent nanoparticles as signal emitters, which function in both paramagnetic and infrared modes. Once this is achieved, nanotechnology may lead to the miniaturisation of detection devices or the remote transduction of signals. Research is also required to improve methods of image analysis and visualisation, such as 3-D optical reconstruction, real-time intracellular tomography, stereo-imaging, virtual and augmented reality, holography, in-vivo imaging from optical catheters, and better endoscopic tools. Furthermore, the ability to measure small local variations in temperature using radio frequency detectors has applications in identifying the onset and locus of many diseases, especially cancer.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

When time permits, psychiatrists also provide specialty mental-health consultation, education and collaboration regarding students to Student Affairs staff, including Residential and Academic Deans. CAPS psychiatrists do not initiate nor continue prescriptions for psycho-stimulant medications. Psychiatrists may provide individual services to individuals who are undergraduate, graduate and professional school students at UCSD, who have paid their current student services fees. Given the ratio of one psychiatrist for approximately 18,000 students, we ask students and families to utilize these services responsibly, for the well-being of individual students and the community at large. For instance, students who transition to UCSD and require ongoing psychiatric medication management need to plan ahead. The demand for these documents has reduced the availability of appointment for students who are seeking counseling services. CAPS Services Documentation Forms may be provided, at the discretion of your psychologist, at follow-up counseling appointments only. If documentation is provided, it will describe a student’s psychological symptoms, diagnosis and personal difficulties. It will not suggest a specific accommodation such as an adjustment to academic requirements or the need to comply with university regulations. Such accommodations are determined by the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD). CAPS encourages students to register at the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSD) if they believe that they have a mental health condition that warrants accommodations. CAPS will provide documentation to OSD about your current or past mental health condition if counseling services are or were provided. If current or previous services were provided by an off-campus mental health professional, then those providers must supply information to OSD about your condition. From Medscape.com How Medical Schools Can Meet Mental Health Needs of Students - Medscape - Oct 03, 2018. Medical students have higher rates of depression, suicidal ideation, and burnout compared with the general population, as well as greater concerns about the stigma of mental illness, write Jordan F. Karp, MD, and Arthur S. Levine, MD, both from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania, in the NEJM article. \"But now we are acknowledging that this problem exists, and we were in denial about the toll it was taking on people working in healthcare.\" Medical schools are a great point to start to work on these issues.\" The 1992 Association of American Medical Colleges Recommendations Regarding Health Services for Medical Students \"remains relevant and includes sensible guidance\" related to mental health issues, note Karp and Levine. These recommendations include providing all students with access to confidential counseling by mental health professionals and establishing confidentiality policies, as well as creating clear policies about administratively mandated evaluation and treatment. But these recommendations may not be optimally implemented by the school because of a lack of resources. Students who are still covered by their parents' health insurance plans may not want their families to know they are receiving mental health treatment, the authors point out, and hectic schedules and lack of time also present barriers to care. At the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, an aggressive and proactive approach has been taken to ease the transition into medical school, reduce stress, and importantly, address the main challenges that students having mental health issues commonly contend with: access, privacy, and stigma. They have created a dedicated medical student mental healthcare team, and it is financially supported by the medical school to provide care for the 560 medical students and 360 graduate students. \"All mental health care is provided to students at no cost, and insurance is never billed, which minimizes students' concerns about stigma and future insurability,\" they emphasize. And to reduce concerns about confidentiality, all \"[t]reatment notes are stored in the firewall-protected electronic medical record of the university counseling center, which is separate from the university hospital's electronic medical record.\" The program also ensures that a psychiatrist will be available to evaluate students who take a voluntary or mandated leave of absence and to give them psychiatric clearance when they return from medical leave and reenter medical school. The Student Health Advocacy Resource Program is organized by medical students and supervised by faculty members from the departments of Medicine and Psychiatry. Finally, the authors point to other schoolwide initiatives that can help improve mental health and reduce stress among students, such as the Faculty and Students Together program, which assists in making the transition into medical school. \"Other medical schools must make the same financial investment and commitment that we have made to achieve a similar result,\" Levine told Medscape Medical News. These include appointing faculty \"wellness advisors,\" sponsoring wellness initiatives to promote self-care, and bringing university counseling center staff on site for regular clinics. \"Our program is known to and available to medical students, residents, faculty, and professional staff, and is readily available to all,\" said Sidney Zisook, MD, a professor of psychiatry at UC San Diego Medical Center. \"Students also have access to student health and counseling services and our college mental health program, which has helped them overcome many of the obstacles to care.\" However, although these interventions are needed to ensure that medical students have access to confidential and appropriate mental healthcare, Srijan Sen, MD, PhD, Frances and Kenneth Eisenberg Professor of Depression and Neurosciences, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, feels that this a more system-level problem than an individual one. Mental health negligence can be attributed to low-income communities being \n\nProviding academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant for several reasons. First and foremost, it ensures equal access to education for all students, regardless of their mental health condition. By providing reasonable accommodations, postsecondary institutions can create an inclusive environment that supports the success and well-being of students with mental illness. Accommodations such as extended time for exams, modified attendance policies, or flexibility in assignment deadlines can help alleviate some of the challenges faced by students with mental illness. These accommodations acknowledge that individuals with mental health conditions may experience periods of heightened symptoms or difficulty managing their daily lives, and provide the necessary support to help them navigate their academic journey. Moreover, academic accommodations can contribute to the overall mental well-being of students with mental illness. Importantly, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness is not just a matter of fairness, but also a legal obligation. The American Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 and its 2008 amendments mandate that students with psychiatric disabilities be provided with reasonable accommodations to ensure equal access to education. By complying with these legal requirements, postsecondary institutions can prevent discrimination and promote equal opportunities for students with mental illness. In summary, providing academic accommodations for students with mental illness in postsecondary education is significant because it ensures equal access to education, supports mental well-being, improves academic performance, and fulfills legal obligations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Visits numbers The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive at least eight antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive eight visits. Not only is visiting prenatal care early is highly recommended, but also a more flexible pathway allowing more visits, from the time a pregnant woman books for prenatal care, as it potentially enables more attention to those women who come late. A new alternative for some of the routine prenatal care visits is Telemedicine. However interventions used together may reduce baby deaths in pregnancy and early life, lower numbers of low birth weight babies born and improve numbers of women receiving antenatal care. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2015 around 830 women died every day from problems in pregnancy and childbirth. A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. However they are less likely to have their waters broken, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or preterm birth. Prenatal examinations At the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk. In many countries, women are given a summary of their case notes including important background information about their pregnancy, such as their medical history, growth charts and any scan reports. If the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive. A review looking into women keeping their own case notes shows they have more risk of having a caesarean section. Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that \"Prenatal Diagnosis\" and \"Prenatal Screening\" refer to two different types of tests) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Obstetricians and midwives have the ability to monitor mother's health and prenatal development during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups. Physical examinations generally consist of: Collection of (mother's) medical history Checking (mother's) blood pressure (Mother's) height and weight Pelvic exam Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring (Mother's) blood and urine tests Discussion with caregiver In some countries, such as the UK, the symphysial fundal height (SFH) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation. A review into this practice found only one piece of research so there is not enough evidence to say whether measuring the SFH helps to detect small or large babies. Growth charts are a way of detecting small babies by the measuring the SFH. A review looking into which of these charts detected small babies found that there is no good quality research to show which is best. Early scans mean that multiple pregnancies\n\nPrenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare.

A study examined the differences in early and low-weight birth deliveries between local and immigrant women and saw the difference caused by prenatal care received. However they are less likely to have their waters broken, an instrumental delivery, episiotomy or preterm birth. Prenatal examinations At the initial antenatal care visit and with the aid of a special booking checklist the pregnant women become classified into either normal risk or high risk. In many countries, women are given a summary of their case notes including important background information about their pregnancy, such as their medical history, growth charts and any scan reports. If the mother goes to a different hospital for care or to give birth the summary of her case notes can be used by the midwives and doctors until her hospital notes arrive. A review looking into women keeping their own case notes shows they have more risk of having a caesarean section. Prenatal diagnosis or prenatal screening (note that \"Prenatal Diagnosis\" and \"Prenatal Screening\" refer to two different types of tests) is testing for diseases or conditions in a fetus or embryo before it is born. Obstetricians and midwives have the ability to monitor mother's health and prenatal development during pregnancy through series of regular check-ups. Physical examinations generally consist of: Collection of (mother's) medical history Checking (mother's) blood pressure (Mother's) height and weight Pelvic exam Doppler fetal heart rate monitoring (Mother's) blood and urine tests Discussion with caregiver In some countries, such as the UK, the symphysial fundal height (SFH) is measured as part of antenatal appointments from 25 weeks gestation. A review into this practice found only one piece of research so there is not enough evidence to say whether measuring the SFH helps to detect small or large babies. Growth charts are a way of detecting small babies by the measuring the SFH. A review looking into which of these charts detected small babies found that there is no good quality research to show which is best. ; A predictive model using blinded ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW) at 36 weeks, maternal age, height, BMI and weight gain correctly identifies women at increased risk of emergency C-section: in this study 48% of screen-positive women delivered by C-section. ; Maternal serum level of Delta-like homolog 1 (DLK1), protein involved in the regulation of maternal metabolic state and fetal growth in mice, differentiates constitutionally small and pathologically small (or fetal growth restricted) human fetuses. ; Fetuses of mothers who developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) grow faster already before the \n\nPrenatal care, also known as antenatal care, is a type of preventive healthcare. It is provided in the form of medical checkups, consisting of recommendations on managing a healthy lifestyle and the provision of medical information such as maternal physiological changes in pregnancy, biological changes, and prenatal nutrition including prenatal vitamins, which prevents potential health problems throughout the course of the pregnancy and promotes the mother and child's health alike.The availability of routine prenatal care, including prenatal screening and diagnosis, has played a part in reducing the frequency of maternal death, miscarriages, birth defects, low birth weight, neonatal infections and other preventable health problems. Visits numbers The WHO recommends that pregnant women should all receive at least eight antenatal visits to spot and treat problems and give immunizations. Although antenatal care is important to improve the health of both mother and baby, many women do not receive eight visits. Not only is visiting prenatal care early is highly recommended, but also a more flexible pathway allowing more visits, from the time a pregnant woman books for prenatal care, as it potentially enables more attention to those women who come late. A new alternative for some of the routine prenatal care visits is Telemedicine.

Among other things, ultrasounds are used to: Diagnose pregnancy (uncommon) Check for multiple fetuses Assess possible risks to the mother (e.g., miscarriage, blighted ovum, ectopic pregnancy, or a molar pregnancy condition) Check for fetal malformation (e.g., club foot, spina bifida, cleft palate, clenched fists) Determine if an intrauterine growth retardation condition exists Note the development of fetal body parts (e.g., heart, brain, liver, stomach, skull, other bones) Check the amniotic fluid and umbilical cord for possible problems Determine due date (based on measurements and relative developmental progress) Generally an ultrasound is ordered whenever an abnormality is suspected or along a schedule similar to the following: 7 weeks — confirm pregnancy, ensure that it's neither molar or ectopic, determine due date 13–14 weeks (some areas) — evaluate the possibility of Down syndrome 18–20 weeks — see the expanded list above 34 weeks (some areas) — evaluate size, verify placental position A review looking at routine ultrasounds past 24 weeks found that there is no evidence to show any benefits to the mother or the baby.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. Humans are the only known host for the bacteria. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice. Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology. Signs and symptoms The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals. Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\" because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids. Cause Transmission Cholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton. Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water. Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as Vibrio cholerae accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton. People infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as \"rice-water\", contaminates water used by others. A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of V. cholerae in the environment. The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person. V. cholerae also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of V. cholerae. This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of V. cholerae to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as 'viable but non-culturable' (VBNC) or more conservatively 'active but non-culturable' (ABNC). One study indicates that the culturability of V. cholerae drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence. Susceptibility About 100million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected. Once the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella to move. On reaching the intestinal wall, V. cholerae start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of V. cholerae bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.

Cholera is caused by a number of types of Vibrio cholerae, with some types producing more severe disease than others. Humans are the only known host for the bacteria. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. Prevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice. Cholera affects an estimated 3–5 million people worldwide and causes 28,800–130,000 deaths a year. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology. Signs and symptoms The primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals.

The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique. Efforts to control the spread of the disease were hampered by the destruction wrought by the cyclone, with 55 health centers destroyed in the region. Beira's main hospital suffered extensive damage, rendering six of its seven operating theaters unusable.

In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes Factors relating to male infertility include: Immune infertility Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics Chromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome One of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Y chromosome deletions Y chromosomal infertility is a direct cause of male infertility due to its effects on sperm production, occurring in 1 out of every 2000 males. Usually affected men show no sign of symptoms other than at times can exhibit smaller teste size. Men with this condition can exhibit azoospermia (no sperm production), oligozoospermia (small number of sperm production), or they will produce abnormally shaped sperm (teratozoospermia). Mumps Malaria Testicular cancer Defects in USP26 in some cases Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. Pre-testicular causes Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including: Varicocele Varicocele is a condition of swollen testicle veins. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. Drugs, alcohol Strenuous riding (bicycle riding, horseback riding) Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, cimetidine, spironolactone; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation Tobacco smoking There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles and kill sperm, but their effect on male fertility is not clear. As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. Another study bred rats exposed to an endocrine disruptor, observing effects up to generation F5 including decreased sperm motility and decreased sperm count. Post-testicular causes Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation: Vas deferens obstruction Lack of Vas deferens, often related to genetic markers for cystic fibrosis Infection, e.g. prostatitis, male accessory gland infection Retrograde ejaculation Ejaculatory duct obstruction Hypospadias Impotence Diagnostic evaluations The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. Medical history The history should include prior testicular or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps orchitis, epididymitis), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, and drug use (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor. The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy (retrograde ejaculation), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply). The physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner will perform a thorough examination of the penis, scrotum, testicles, I vas deferens, spermatic cords, ejaculatory ducts, urethra, urinary bladder, anus and rectum. An orchidometer can measure testicular volume, which in turn is tightly associated with both sperm and hormonal parameters. Sperm sample Semen sample obtaining Semen sample obtaining is the first step in spermiogram. The optimal sexual abstinence for semen sample obtaining is of 2–7 days. The first way to obtain the semen sample is through masturbation, and the best place to obtain it is in the same clinic, as this way temperature\n\nMale infertility refers to a sexually mature male's inability to impregnate a fertile female. In humans it accounts for 40–50% of infertility. Male infertility is commonly due to deficiencies in the semen, and semen quality is used as a surrogate measure of male fecundity. Causes Factors relating to male infertility include: Immune infertility Antisperm antibodies (ASA) have been considered as infertility cause in around 10–30% of infertile couples. Genetics Chromosomal anomalies and genetic mutations account for nearly 10–15% of all male infertility cases. Klinefelter syndrome One of the most commonly known causes of infertility is Klinefelter syndrome, affecting 1 out of 500–1000 newborn males Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosomal defect that occurs during gamete formation due to a non-disjunction error during cell division. Y chromosome deletions Y chromosomal infertility is a direct cause of male infertility due to its effects on sperm production, occurring in 1 out of every 2000 males. Usually affected men show no sign of symptoms other than at times can exhibit smaller teste size. Men with this condition can exhibit azoospermia (no sperm production), oligozoospermia (small number of sperm production), or they will produce abnormally shaped sperm (teratozoospermia). Mumps Malaria Testicular cancer Defects in USP26 in some cases Acrosomal defects affecting egg penetration Idiopathic oligospermia - unexplained sperm deficiencies account for 30% of male infertility. Pre-testicular causes Pre-testicular factors refer to conditions that impede adequate support of the testes and include situations of poor hormonal support and poor general health including: Varicocele Varicocele is a condition of swollen testicle veins. Coeliac men may have reversible infertility. It is likely that an effective evaluation for infertility would best include assessment for underlying celiac disease, both in men and women. Drugs, alcohol Strenuous riding (bicycle riding, horseback riding) Medications, including those that affect spermatogenesis such as chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, cimetidine, spironolactone; those that decrease FSH levels such as phenytoin; those that decrease sperm motility such as sulfasalazine and nitrofurantoin Genetic abnormalities such as a Robertsonian translocation Tobacco smoking There is increasing evidence that the harmful products of tobacco smoking may damage the testicles and kill sperm, but their effect on male fertility is not clear. As men age there is a consistent decline in semen quality, and this decline appears to be due to DNA damage. Another study bred rats exposed to an endocrine disruptor, observing effects up to generation F5 including decreased sperm motility and decreased sperm count. Post-testicular causes Post-testicular factors decrease male fertility due to conditions that affect the male genital system after testicular sperm production and include defects of the genital tract as well as problems in ejaculation: Vas deferens obstruction Lack of Vas deferens, often related to genetic markers for cystic fibrosis Infection, e.g. prostatitis, male accessory gland infection Retrograde ejaculation Ejaculatory duct obstruction Hypospadias Impotence Diagnostic evaluations The diagnosis of infertility begins with a medical history and physical exam by a physician, physician assistant, or nurse practitioner. Typically two separate semen analyses will be required. Medical history The history should include prior testicular or penile insults (torsion, cryptorchidism, trauma), infections (mumps orchitis, epididymitis), environmental factors, excessive heat, radiation, medications, and drug use (anabolic steroids, alcohol, smoking).Sexual habits, frequency and timing of intercourse, use of lubricants, and each partner's previous fertility experiences are important.Loss of libido and headaches or visual disturbances may indicate a pituitary tumor. The past medical or surgical history may reveal thyroid or liver disease (abnormalities of spermatogenesis), diabetic neuropathy (retrograde ejaculation), radical pelvic or retroperitoneal surgery (absent seminal emission secondary to sympathetic nerve injury), or hernia repair (damage to the vas deferens or testicular blood supply).

According to researchers at Boston University, CTE is a brain disease involving progressive neurological deterioration common in athletes, military personnel, and others who have a history of brain trauma. Symptoms from CTE do not typically appear in a subject until many years after the initial injuries, and a conclusive diagnosis of the disease can only be achieved through autopsy. Although CTE remains mysterious and controversial, researchers have observed a link between the disease and the protein called tau, which slowly forms clumps in the brain that kill brain cells. This often results in subjects experiencing depression, anxiety, memory loss, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Mission and Practices The goal of the Boston University CTE Center is to collect and study post-mortem brains to better understand the long-term diseases associated with head trauma. Specifically, the CTE Center focuses its research on the formation of neurodegenerative diseases, including Post-Concussion Syndrome and CTE. During case studies, researchers at the CTE Center perform high-impact tests and in-depth autopsies on post-mortem brains to further understand the neuropathology and clinical presentation of CTE. The Center's ultimate goal is to develop a test that would definitively diagnose CTE in a living subject. In order to accomplish this, researchers at Boston University made it a priority to study as many post-mortem brains as possible, which led to the formation of the VA-BU-CLF Brain Bank. Currently, the Brain Bank contains over 600 brains, including 325 brains that have been diagnosed with CTE since the formation of the bank. The Bank then stores these samples optimally to ensure proper care and treatment before, during, and after research testing. The Brain Bank directors will also share findings with family members and caregivers of the deceased. Her research focuses on CTE and the late effects of neurodegeneration. This publication discussed 47 instances of neuropathological deterioration determined to be CTE. The study was primarily conducted to develop a more accurate clinical presentation of CTE in the brain. Through in-depth autopsies, the researchers observed the formation of proteins in the brain that caused initial brain cell decay, ultimately leading to CTE in the brain. This study was released in 2015 and detailed the autopsies performed by researchers on the donated brains and brain tissue. These examinations were performed at both the macroscopic and microscopic levels, in order to identify important neuropathological characteristics of CTE, including how the brain deteriorates over time, and the distribution of proteins in brains with CTE.

Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with head trauma. Simply put, it causes damage to brain cells that results in cell death and worsens over time. But as it develops, CTE can lead to worsening dementia and death. It was first identified in boxers in the 1920s as “punch-drunk” dementia and then “dementia pugilistica,” and its underlying pathology was described in 1973. Because of this, CTE may be a risk factor for Alzheimer’s and FTD, though research has not yet confirmed this. Since 1973, CTE has been diagnosed in boxers, wrestlers, military veterans, and baseball, football, ice hockey, rugby, and soccer players. A 2015 report on the brain health risks of youth sports co-sponsored by the Alzheimer’s Drug Discovery Foundation (ADDF) also found that children who played contact sports were at risk of developing CTE later in life. But efforts are underway to develop diagnostic tools for living patients. The ADDF is funding Sam Gandy, MD, PhD, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai for one such project. Dr. Gandy is using 18F-AV-1451, a PET imaging agent being developed by Avid Pharmaceuticals, to try to image tau tangles and threads in the brains of people who have sustained multiple head injuries. It could also be used to assess CTE risk in younger players by detecting the presence of tau in the brain after a head injury. At Harvard Medical School, Neil Vasdev, PhD, is also working on a tau imaging program with support from the ADDF. Dr. Vasdev is using 18F-MK-6240, a PET imaging agent created by Merck that binds to tau deposits in the brain in a different way. He and his team are testing their PET scan in patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease. Having multiple diagnostic tools is important for differentiating between the multiple diseases that involve tau. But their chances of success and ability to recruit the right patients will be greatly improved with tau diagnostics. It’s critical to understand what kind of tau—and therefore, which disease—a patient has they can test a treatment designed specifically for it. I thought it made sense to publish most of the press release that Boston University put out this week about the extensive study it did on the brains of many deceased athletes and soldiers. The research found that they were suffering from the progressive degenerative brain disease that’s been linked to repeated head trauma. This landmark research was done by investigators at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) and the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, in collaboration with the Sports Legacy Institute (SLI). The study described 68 cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) among deceased athletes and military veterans whose brain and spinal cords were donated to the VA CSTE Brain Bank. Dr. Ann McKee, professor at Boston University School of Medicine, director of the Neuropathology Service for VA New England Healthcare System and co-director of the CSTE, led the study, which is the first to characterize the pathology of the disease into four stages of severity. CTE is a degenerative brain disease associated with repeated brain trauma, including concussions and multiple subconcussive exposures such as those in contact sports and military combat, the press release explained. “In early stages, CTE is characterized by the presence of abnormal deposits of a protein called tau in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles and neuropil threads throughout the brain,” according to the release. “These tau lesions eventually lead to brain cell death. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem. The report provides specific pathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE and divides CTE into four stages of disease (Stages I-IV), according to the press release. “In Stage III, reported symptoms included cognitive impairment and problems with executive functions, specifically planning, organization, multitasking and judgment,” according to the release. One-third of the CTE cases were diagnosed with additional neurodegenerative disease, including: motor neuron disease (12 percent), Lewy body disease (16 percent), Alzheimer’s disease (11 percent) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (six percent). Researchers cautioned that further studies are needed to investigate the incidence and prevalence of CTE; whether the symptoms of CTE are distinct from other conditions; how genetics influence susceptibility or resistance to CTE; and whether other environmental exposures also play an additive role in the development of CTE. “While it remains unknown what level of exposure to brain trauma is required to trigger CTE, there is no available evidence that occasional, isolated or well-managed concussions give rise to CTE,” said Dr. Robert Cantu, a coauthor of the paper and co-director of CSTE as well as co-founder of SLI.

Inflammation has also been connected to depression,  and a 2016 study found broccoli sprouts effective to “prevent or minimize the relapse by inflammation.”  This same study found that the extracts of broccoli sprouts were so effective, they acted as a prophylactic that could “prevent the onset of LPS-induced depression-like behaviors” in the juvenile and adolescent mice they were testing, all the way into adulthood. More research is being done on the phytochemicals of cruciferous vegetables and depression. A 2000 study on female fibromyalgia patients reported that the combination of ascorbigen (derived from Vitamin C) and broccoli powder “reduces pain sensitivity and improves quality of life”  for patients suffering from this challenging condition. “[T]he results show that a relatively short dietary treatment with broccoli sprouts can strongly protect the heart against oxidative stress and cell death caused by ischemia-reperfusion.”  R Which is promising, indeed! One particularly interesting study was carried out on young male smokers, in which 250g/day of broccoli was consumed, for a ten-day period. In 2015 broccoli sprout extract was again found highly effective in reducing of oxidative stress,  in this case being observed to assist with healthy liver function. As anti-inflammatories go, sulforaphane is right up there with that king of all spices, curcumin (turmeric) giving our cruciferous vegetables the upper hand in the list of healing foods. “[T]he consumption of broccoli sprouts modulated the excretion of biomarkers linked to inflammation and vascular reactions,”  according to a 2015 study.

Some countries or jurisdictions, including some areas of the U.S., have enacted laws expressly to criminalize HIV transmission or exposure, charging those accused with criminal transmission of HIV. People have been accused of and charged for HIV non-disclosure even if no harm was intended and if HIV was not actually transmitted. Legal situation In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \"negligent\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. Australia In Australia the regulations concerned with the transmission of HIV are found in two sources, the Public Healths Acts and in the criminal law. New South Wales The New South Wales (NSW) Public Health Act from 2010 regulates under section 79 that a person with HIV must disclose their status to all sexual partners. If talking about the problems of practising safe sex does not help, the doctor may obtain a Public Health Order to manage the behaviour of the HIV positive person. Only a small number of sex workers and clients have received a Public Health Order or 'management' intervention for potentially breaking the law. Under the criminal law, a person with HIV is criminally liable for prosecution if they have intentionally transmitted the virus to their partner without informing them of their status. Canada Though Canadian federal law does not contain any HIV-specific statutes, HIV transmission and exposure are otherwise prosecuted under general offense laws, such as aggravated assault or aggravated sexual assault. Current law and policy Commonly referred to as \"HIV non-disclosure\", criminal transmission of HIV in Canada is defined as a \"realistic possibility of transmission\" of HIV during sexual intercourse. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual's partner is on PrEP or (4) the type of sexual act (such as oral sex) is one where there is a negligible risk of transmission.\" This allows for four different scenarios in which HIV positive people will not have to disclose their status because of the nature of the sexual encounter; current laws only allow for one specific scenario with multiple requirements. HIV researchers have criticized the recommendations for not going far enough to counteract the adverse effects that the current law imposes on women. Although people living with HIV are generally aware of non-disclosure laws, many do not fully understand the law or understand when they do or do not have to disclose their status. History The first notable case of HIV non-disclosure is R. v Cuerrier, where the defendant was charged with aggravated assault and sexual transmission of HIV under section 268 of the Criminal Code. The Court's ruling caused difficulty because even though it only concerned non-disclosure of HIV-positive status in sexual situations, it unanimously rejected the English authority of R. v Clarence, with L'Heureux-Dubé stating that any fraud could vitiate consent to all types of assault because the autonomy and physical integrity of the person has been violated. Thus, because the Canadian legislature has declined to criminalize the transmission of HIV, the judiciary must address the issues as and when they arise. After being diagnosed with HIV in 2004, Clato Mabior underwent aggressive antiretroviral therapy and was adhering to treatment at the time of pursuing sexual relations with multiple partners between 2004–2006. Subsequent legal precedent has\n\nThe HIV Organ Policy Equity Act (the HOPE Act) is a law that modifies rules regarding organ donation between HIV-positive individuals. The law authorizes clinical research and the revision of rules about organ donation and transportation as a result of the research. The use of HIV-positive organs was previously a federal crime. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act revised the Organ Transplant Amendments Act of 1988, a law that prevented patients from receiving organs from HIV positive people. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act shortened organ transplant wait times, including the wait times for people without HIV as more HIV positive patients receive organs. The HIV Organ Policy Equity Act amends the Public Health Service Act to repeal the requirement that the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network adopt and use standards of quality for the acquisition and transportation of donated organs that include standards for preventing the acquisition of organs infected with the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The bill replaces this requirement with authorization for the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network to adopt and use such standards with respect to organs infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), provided that any such standards ensure that organs infected with HIV may be transplanted only into individuals who are: (1) infected with such virus before receiving such an organ; and (2) participating in clinical research approved by an institutional review board under the criteria, standards, and regulations regarding organs infected with HIV developed under this Act or, if participation in such research is no longer warranted, receiving a transplant under such standards and regulations. Finally, the bill amends the federal criminal code to declare that an organ donation does not violate the prohibition against a knowing organ donation by an HIV-infected individual if the donation is made in accordance with this Act. The bill removes a provision in current law that prohibits the acquisition and procurement of donated organs that are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. S. 330 also requires the Secretary of HHS to develop guidelines for conducting research relating to organ transplants from donors who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

It is used to help with quitting smoking or stopping chewing tobacco. Types of NRT include the adhesive patch, chewing gum, lozenges, nose spray, and inhaler. Common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning and continued addiction. They do not appear to increase the risk of heart attacks. Nicotine replacement therapy works by reducing cravings caused by nicotine addiction. Nicotine replacement products are on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses Nicotine replacement therapy, in the form of gum, patches, nasal spray, inhaler and lozenges all improve the ability of people trying to quit tobacco products. Nicotine replacement therapy is as effective as medications, such as bupropion, in helping people quit smoking for at least six months. All forms of nicotine replacement therapy, including nicotine gum, patches, nasal spray, inhalers, and lozenges, have similar success rates in terms of helping people stop smoking. However, the likelihood that someone will stick to a certain treatment varies, with compliance being the highest with nicotine patches, followed by nicotine gum, inhalers, and nasal sprays. Using a few different nicotine replacement methods in combination may improve success rates in stopping tobacco use. Additionally, using nicotine replacement with counseling has been proven to improve tobacco abstinence rates. Using nicotine replacement therapy to quit smoking should be considered for people who are severely dependent on nicotine. People who are severely dependent include those who smoke: more than one pack per day, within five minutes of awakening, while ill, when they wake up in the middle of the night, to ease withdrawal signs and symptoms. The National Health Service (NHS) in England has a smoking cessation service based on pharmacotherapy in combination with counseling support. Pierce and Gilpin (2002) stated their conclusion as follows: “Since becoming available over the counter, NRT appears no longer effective in increasing long-term successful cessation” (p. 1260). The efficacy for each of the formulations alone (lozenges, nasal spray, gum, and transdermal patch) to aid in smoking cessation is equal. Efficacy increases 15% to 36% with combining treatments such as gum and lozenges. Higher doses increase the chance of stopping smoking for a period of six months and more. E-cigarettes are twice as effective as NRT in helping people quit smoking. There is evidence that nicotine negatively affects fetal brain development and pregnancy outcomes. There is also risk of stillbirth and pre-term birth. Nicotine use will probably harm fetal neurological development. It also puts the child at increased risk for nicotine addiction in the future. Evidence is unclear whether adolescents gain benefit from cognitive-behavioral therapy or smoking cessation over the long-term as of 2017. Smoking is known to cause cardiovascular diseases such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Cigarette smoking is the cause of 20% of all cardiovascular deaths in the United States, which is the leading cause of mortality. Side effects Some side effects are caused by the nicotine, and are common to NRT products. Other common side effects depend on the formulation of nicotine. Common side effects with the patch include skin irritation and a dry mouth while the inhaler commonly results in a cough, runny nose, or headaches. Serious risks include nicotine poisoning, which includes symptoms like visual disturbances, hyper-salivation, nausea, and vomiting; and continued addiction to nicotine products. Avoiding smoking and other products with nicotine are recommended since it may lead to nicotine overdose. Limited evidence exists regarding long-term NRT use, and concerns exist that long-term NRT use could raise cancer\n\nSmoking cessation, usually called quitting smoking or stopping smoking, is the process of discontinuing tobacco smoking. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\"), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was \"not at all difficult\" to stop, 27% said it was \"fairly difficult\", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Single medications include: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries \"did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo\". There is no good evidence anxiolytics are helpful. But it is important to know that the manufacturers of rimonabant and taranabant stopped production in 2008 due to its serious side effects. In comparison, 12% the people who got placebo kept from smoking for (at least) an entire year. During the course of one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation. When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can have positive effects on quitting for six months and longer. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult.

During the course of one year, the benefit from using smoking cessation medications (Bupropion, NRT, or varenicline) decreases from 17% in 3 months, to 12% in 6 months to 8% in 12 months. This can theoretically be accomplished through repeated changes to cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine, by gradually reducing the number of cigarettes smoked each day, or by smoking only a fraction of a cigarette on each occasion. A 2009 systematic review by researchers at the University of Birmingham found that gradual nicotine replacement therapy could be effective in smoking cessation. When reducing the number of smoked cigarettes, it found some evidence that additional varenicline or fast-acting nicotine replacement therapy can have positive effects on quitting for six months and longer. Tobacco smoke contains nicotine, which is addictive and can cause dependence. As a result, nicotine withdrawal often makes the process of quitting difficult. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death worldwide. Smoking cessation significantly reduces the risk of dying from smoking-related diseases such as coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and lung cancer. Many strategies can be used for smoking cessation, including abruptly quitting without assistance (\"cold turkey\"), cutting down then quitting, behavioral counseling, and medications such as bupropion, cytisine, nicotine replacement therapy, or varenicline. Most smokers who try to quit do so without assistance. However, only 3–6% of quit attempts without assistance are successful long-term. Behavioral counseling and medications each increase the rate of successfully quitting smoking, and a combination of behavioral counseling with a medication such as bupropion is more effective than either intervention alone. In nicotine-dependent smokers, quitting smoking can lead to symptoms of nicotine withdrawal such as nicotine cravings, anxiety, irritability, depression, and weight gain. Professional smoking cessation support methods generally attempt to address nicotine withdrawal symptoms to help the person break free of nicotine addiction. Over 74.7% of smokers attempt to quit without any assistance, otherwise known as \"Cold Turkey\", or with home remedies. Identifying which approach or technique is eventually most successful is difficult; it has been estimated, for example, that only about 4% to 7% of people are able to quit smoking on any given attempt without medicines or other help. The majority of quit attempts are still unassisted, though the trend seems to be shifting. In a large British study of ex-smokers in the 1980s, before the advent of pharmacotherapy, 53% of the ex-smokers said that it was \"not at all difficult\" to stop, 27% said it was \"fairly difficult\", and the remaining 20% found it very difficult. Single medications include: Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): Five medications have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) deliver nicotine in a form that does not involve the risks of smoking: transdermal nicotine patches, nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges, nicotine inhalers, nicotine oral sprays, and nicotine nasal sprays. NRTs increase the chance of stopping smoking by 50 to 60% compared to placebo or to no treatment. However, more recent studies indicate less serious neuropsychiatric side effects. For example, a 2016 study involving 8,144 patients treated at 140 centers in 16 countries \"did not show a significant increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to varenicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo\".

Despite this, EUPD or BPD is the same thing. I have written articles about it. My psychiatrist has referred me to an organisation based in Cornwall that helps those with mental health issues. In July 2017, I wrote an article about gender and how gender specific terms need to be replaced with non-gender specific terms. In that article, I wrote about how Saltash Town Council had been debating about the future of the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how it was my belief that the argument was in the wrong, as it was about whether a male mayor’s consort could wear the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how this was a breach of the Equality Act 2010. The debate was concluded with the decision to retire the chain. However, it was come to my attention that the controversial issue has been reopened but without a debate being granted. Why do non-gender specific terms matter? Contemporary times and shifting attitudes towards different sections in society has resulted in certain words becoming redundant and replaced with terms that can be used equally for a wider range of people. We have done this most clearly with the changes regarding gender specific terms. Those who own land are, in the majority, still referred to with the gender specific terms, but there has been a growing change to calling them ‘land owners’ instead. We change these terms because that is the right thing to do. Of course, gender specific terms are also outdated, because we are aware of gender no longer being a binary thing. In fact, it could be argued that “gender is not a straight line… it is a spectrum”. Therefore, why should we continue to use gender specific terms for roles that can be carried out by anyone, no matter what gender they identify as? We need gender specific terms to go the same way as the dinosaurs. Gender specificity is archaic, discriminatory, and wrong. Further to the argument surrounding gender specific terms, and how society should be proud of liberal values of equality, we come to the current issue that is being stirred back up with Saltash Town Council: the “Mayoress’ Chain”. The debate, however, will not be a debate. Instead, the controversial mayor has declared that there will be no debate, but only a vote. However, the vote will not be carried out during a meeting, but over an online poll and for this result to be read out during the next council meeting. If you’re wondering, like I am, for the reasons behind this bizarre decision, keep reading as I will analyse the mayor’s actions later in this article. For now, I would like to keep discussing what should be the main issue here: the term “mayoress”. The argument was that the chain should not be used by male consorts as it had been originally, and historically, gifted to the town for the use of the mayoress. This argument, however, would be a breach of the Equality Act 2010. If a mayor’s consort is forbidden the use of the chain because of their gender, it is a form of direct discrimination. There were other arguments offered, but to me this was the main problem: you cannot exclude someone from something based purely on their gender. It would have been my suggestion to change the outdated title of the chain to “The Mayoral Consort’s Chain” or simply “The Consort’s Chain”. However, the council decided to retire the chain.

Similarly, a fitness room in River Falls, Wisconsin was renamed to avoid the racist connotations of it being referred to as the \"White Pride Fitness Room\". The slogan was chanted along with \"White Power\" by up to 100 neo-Nazis rallying in Manchester, United Kingdom in March 2015 and was the theme of a March 2016 event in Swansea and a March 2017 event in Edinburgh, all of which were organized by the National Front. In an exposé from The Week, James Poulos warned that \"Europe is on track to rediscover what looks to us like a highly unsettling form of white pride.\" In an interview with a conservative website, Saucedo Mercer, a Mexican immigrant who became a U.S. citizen, talked in depth about her views on immigration. She stated the issue was important because people from places other than Mexico were among those coming across the border illegally.

A 2002 study identified white pride as a motivation for racial hate crimes on a US college campus, while in a different study on internet racism, the slogan was identified as being part of an emerging transnationalist trend in white supremacist movements. The slogan was also documented to have been used in hate speech incidents at New York University, Vassar College, Temple University, the University of Oregon, and the University of Tennessee, and it was a slogan used in posters put \n\n on the porch.

The research suggests that homosexuality is a deep-seated predisposition with a biological origin, similar to heterosexuality. The studies conducted by Kinsey and colleagues, for example, indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be attributed to a single social or psychological cause. One line of evidence supporting the biological basis of homosexuality involves morphological studies of the hypothalamus. Additionally, LeVay discovered that a specific cluster of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus is larger in heterosexual men compared to women, as well as heterosexual men compared to homosexual men. Genetic studies also point towards a biological basis for homosexuality. Data from multiple studies show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins and 13 percent of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Inheritance patterns of male homosexuality often implicate a gene on the X chromosome, particularly from the maternal side. It is worth mentioning that psychoanalytic explanations and attempts to prove an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been substantiated by scientific evidence. The current consensus is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, although it may result in secondary reactive disturbances at times. Overall, the evidence from studies on brain morphology and genetics supports the hypothesis that homosexuality has a biological basis. - LeVay, S. \"A difference in hypothalamic structure between heterosexual and homosexual men.\" \"A gene(s) for homosexuality?.\" The studies of Kinsey and colleagues indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be traced to a single social or psychologic root.The most widely held current view is that homosexuality is not a mental or a personality disorder, though it may at times lead to secondary reactive disturbances.Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed.The authors favor the hypothesis that differences or variations in genetic patterning of the nervous system (possibly of the hypothalamus) set the sexual predilection during early life. If confirmed, these findings, which have been disputed by Byne and others, would support the view that homosexuality has a biologic basis. Pooled data from 5 studies in men show that approximately 57 percent of identical twins (and 13 percent of brothers) of homosexual men are also homosexual. In most studies, the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome (LeVay and Hamer) but to suggest there is a simple genetic connection is oversimplified. Attempts to demonstrate an endocrine basis for homosexuality have also failed. The most widely held current view is that homosexuality is not a mental or a personality disorder, though it may at times lead to secondary reactive disturbances. The studies of Kinsey and colleagues indicate that a homosexual orientation cannot be traced to a single social or psychologic root.The status of bisexuality is undetermined.The Development of Personality and Social Adaptation (See Also Chap.50)\n\nPersonality, the most inclusive of all psychologic terms, encompasses the entirety of psychologic traits that distinguish one individual from every other.The notion that one’s physical characteristics are determined by inheritance is a fundamental tenet of biology. They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\". Results from the first large, comprehensive multi-center genetic linkage study of male sexual orientation were reported by an independent group of researchers at the American Society of Human Genetics in 2012. The study population included 409 independent pairs of gay brothers, who were analyzed with over 300,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Pooled data from multiple studies have shown that approximately 57% of identical twins and 13% of brothers of homosexual men are also homosexual. Most studies suggest that the inheritance pattern of male homosexuality comes from the maternal side, implicating a gene on the X chromosome. However, it is important to note that suggesting a simple genetic connection oversimplifies the complex nature of sexual orientation. It is worth mentioning that attempts to establish an endocrine basis for homosexuality have not been successful, and psychoanalytic explanations of homosexuality have not been substantiated. Overall, the current widely held view is that homosexuality is not a mental or personality disorder, but rather a result of various factors including genetic and possibly early life differences in the genetic patterning of the nervous system, particularly in the hypothalamus. - LeVay S.

Tamoxifen has been used in some studies of early abortion in combination with misoprostol. Two small studies from China suggest that multiple daily administrations of letrozole followed by misoprostol, 800 micrograms vaginally, may be another effective option for medical abortion, but more research is needed regarding this regimen (21, 22). If clinical history indicates that the woman had a confirmed abortion, a pelvic examination is performed to confirm uterine involution. Complete abortion rates are higher with earlier gestations; approximately 96–98% in gestations of up to 42 days, 91–95% in gestations from 43 days to 49 days, and less than 85% in gestations beyond 49 days (24, 26, 27). When abortion does not occur within 3–4 hours after oral misoprostol administration, use of an additional dose does not improve efficacy (26, 28). Additional “evidence-based” regimens have been developed to improve medical abortion in terms of expense, safety, speed, and adverse effects. Women can safely and effectively self-administer misoprostol at home as part of a medical abortion regimen (32, 34, 35). If she is uncertain, then the decision about abortion technique must be delayed until she has reached a firm decision, even if the delay means that she will be unable to choose a medical option. Only when a woman has considered her options and decided to have an abortion does the discussion about the different methods become an issue. Most women who seek early abortion will be eligible for medical and surgical methods. Studies that have compared abortion method preferences have included groups of patients who choose their method and those who are randomized to their method. The applicability of these studies to current U.S. medical abortion practice is limited given that no studies included the mifepristone−misoprostol regimen, and in two studies, surgical abortion was performed only under general anesthesia. Generally, women are satisfied with the method they choose but, when randomized, prefer surgical abortion to medical abortion (36–38). Most women choose medical abortion because of a desire to avoid surgery, a perception that medical abortion is safer than surgical abortion, and a belief that medical abortion is more natural and private than a surgical procedure (39). Compared with surgical abortion, medical abortion takes longer to complete, requires more active patient participation, and is associated with higher reported rates of bleeding and cramping. With medical abortion, expulsion of the products of conception most likely will occur at home, but a few women will still require surgical evacuation to complete the abortion. An early surgical abortion takes place most commonly in one visit and involves less waiting and less doubt about when the abortion occurs compared with medical abortion. In addition, women who undergo surgical abortion will not see any products of conception or blood clots during the procedure. Bleeding and cramping will be experienced by most women undergoing medical abortion and are necessary for the process to occur. The\n\n Abortion rates also vary depending on the stage of pregnancy and the method practiced. In 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that 26% of reported legal induced abortions in the United States were known to have been obtained at less than 6 weeks' gestation, 18% at 7 weeks, 15% at 8 weeks, 18% at 9 through 10 weeks, 10% at 11 through 12 weeks, 6% at 13 through 15 weeks, 4% at 16 through 20 weeks and 1% at more than 21 weeks. An American study in 2002 concluded that about half of women having abortions were using a form of contraception at the time of becoming pregnant. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that \"most abortions in the United States are obtained by minority women\" because minority women \"have much higher rates of unintended pregnancy\". The abortion rate may also be expressed as the average number of abortions a woman has during her reproductive years; this is referred to as total abortion rate (TAR). The abortion rate worldwide was 28 per 1000 women per year, though it was 24 per 1000 women per year for developed countries and 29 per 1000 women per year for developing countries. The same 2012 study indicated that in 2008, the estimated abortion percentage of known pregnancies was at 21% worldwide, with 26% in developed countries and 20% in developing countries. On average, the incidence of abortion is similar in countries with restrictive abortion laws and those with more liberal access to abortion. However, restrictive abortion laws are associated with increases in the percentage of abortions performed unsafely. The unsafe abortion rate in developing countries is partly \n\n per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" In Indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion, 4.5 million pregnancies were carried to term,\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Cytokine storm syndromes include familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Epstein-Barr virus–associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic or non-systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis–associated macrophage activation syndrome, NLRC4 macrophage activation syndrome, cytokine release syndrome and sepsis. History\nThe first reference to the term cytokine storm in the published medical literature appears to be by James Ferrara in 1993 during a discussion of graft vs. host disease; a condition in which the role of excessive and self-perpetuating cytokine release had already been under discussion for many years. Relationship to COVID-19\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, some doctors have attributed many deaths to cytokine storms. A cytokine storm can cause the severe symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which has a high mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. ARDS was shown to be the cause of mortality in 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Ferritin and IL-6 are considered to be possible immunological biomarkers for severe and fatal cases of COVID-19. Due to the increased levels of cytokines and interferons in patients with severe COVID-19, both have been investigated as potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 therapy. An animal study found that mice producing an early strong interferon response to SARS-CoV-2 were likely to live, but in other cases the disease progressed to a highly morbid overactive immune system. The high mortality rate of COVID-19 in older populations has been attributed to the impact of age on interferon responses. Short-term use of dexamethasone, a synthetic corticosteroid, has been demonstrated to reduce the severity of inflammation and lung damage induced by a cytokine storm by inhibiting the severe cytokine storm or the hyperinflammatory phase in patients with COVID-19. Clinical trials continue to identify causes of cytokine storms in COVID-19 cases. High viremia is also associated with exacerbated Type I interferons response and worse prognosis. Diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are all risk factors of cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients. Here, we investigated the effects of EMFs with long-term evolution (LTE, 1.762 GHz) and 5G (28 GHz) bandwidth on skin pigmentation in vitro. Murine and Human melanoma cells (B16F10 and MNT-1) were exposed to either LTE or 5G for 4 h per day, which is considered the upper bound of average smartphone use time. It was shown that neither LTE nor 5G exposure induced significant effects on cell viability or pigmentation. Collectively, these results imply that exposure to LTE and 5G EMFs may not affect melanin synthesis or skin pigmentation under normal smartphone use condition. In the afternoon of 30 December, upon seeing the words \"SARS coronavirus, pseudomonas aeruginosa\", Ai immediately reported to the hospital's public health department and infection department. From there it spread throughout medical circles in Wuhan, and reached Li Wenliang, an \n\nEvidence for a connection between coronavirus disease-19 and exposure to radiofrequency radiation from wireless communications including 5G. Label=\"BACKGROUND AND AIM\" NlmCategory=\"OBJECTIVE\">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) public health policy has focused on the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus and its effects on human health while environmental factors have been largely ignored. In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor. There are two main types of electromagnetic radiation: non-ionizing radiation and ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation includes radio frequency, microwaves, and light. On the other hand, ionizing radiation includes ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. These higher frequency EMFs can lead to DNA and cellular damage with prolonged exposure. While non-ionizing radiation is generally considered safe, the use of certain devices that emit non-ionizing radiation, such as cell phones and microwaves, has raised concerns about potential health effects. However, extensive research has not demonstrated any consistent evidence linking these devices to harmful effects on human cells. Overall, while it is important to be mindful of prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation, the effects of non-ionizing radiation on human cells are generally minimal and non-harmful. It is always recommended to follow guidelines and safety measures to minimize any potential risks associated with electromagnetic radiation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Hemispherectomy was revitalized in children in the 1980s by John M. Freeman and Ben Carson at Johns Hopkins Hospital. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery. Patient criteria \nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. One such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. In one study of children under 5 who had this surgery to treat catastrophic epilepsy, 73.7% were freed of all seizures. The success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life. The conclusion: “adult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and most profit from surgery in several quality of life domains.”\n\nUltimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater. Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies. For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5. Previously, she had suffered from Rasmussen's encephalitis, which caused her to experience around 150 seizures a day.

In all the patients, visual inspection identified unilateral mesial temporal sclerosis, and the patients underwent craniotomy and lesionectomy. According to the results, eight patients were categorized in class I and two cases were classifies as class II, and all the patients survived. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a common type of epilepsy in children, which is difficult to control by medication (1). The results obtained by these methods should be interpreted in the context of clinical, electrographic, and MRI data. Neuroplasticity decreases by age; therefore, faster recovery is expected during infancy and early childhood. Nonetheless, intractable seizure is a risk factor for refractory epilepsy. As a result, patients with medically intractable TLE should undergo surgery as soon as possible (1,2). This prospective pilot study was conducted on 12 patients entailing five males and seven females, who aged between 2 and 16 years old with medically refractory mesial TLE confirmed by a pediatric neurologist. All the patients underwent MRI scanning, and if MRI did not reveal any abnormality, SPECT was performed. Interictal preoperative electroencephalography (EEG) was performed for all the patients in addition to pre- and post-operative (one year later) neuropsychological tests. These data were not taken into account during the process of surgical decision-making. The surgical outcomes were categorized to three classes including class I (seizure-free or simple partial seizures only), class II (worthwhile improvement [≥90%]), and no worthwhile improvement. The follow-up period ranged between 12 and 48 months, with mean and standard deviation of 24±5 months. Moreover, at the post-operative phase, no continuous video-EEG monitoring, PET, Wada test, or SPECT was performed. No mortality occurred in any of the patients. In these two patients, the postoperative MRI revealed a posterior temporal cortical damage. TLE can be treated through surgical procedures. Clinical characteristics of children undergoing TLE surgery including seizure types, histopathology, EEG findings, postoperative seizure, and neuropsychological outcomes may provide important information on the effect of surgery on TLE. The outcomes of temporal lobectomy was significantly better than antiepileptic drugs (AED) treatment. Therefore, it is recommended to postpone presurgical evaluation in case of medical intractability. Moreover, children with intractable seizures show intellectual decline over time; accordingly, surgery is the gold standard of treatment at earlier stages to reduce the severity of cognitive impairment (7). It is indicated that TLE surgery is a safe and effective method to treat children with intractable epilepsy (8,9). found that TLE surgery was able to keep patients seizure-free for almost up to two decades (10). This result was consistent with the results obtained by a study performed in the Cleveland Clinic. TLE surgery may impair memory, generally verbal memory and spatial learning disorders may happen following left-and right-sided temporal lobe resection. There is a greater risk for postoperative memory decline in patients with poorer presurgical mood (15). In a study with a follow-up duration of shorter than two years, no improvement of intellectual functioning was found (17). Therefore, a longer follow-up interval is required for cognitive recovery. carried out a study on the results of a nine years follow-up of 42 children underwent TLE surgery and showed a significant improvement in IQ after a follow-up period of more than five years in the surgical group, while the non-surgical control group did\n\nvagus nerve stimulation, which involves implantation of battery-operated generator of intermittent electrical stimuli to an electrode wrapped around left vagus nerve. ; corpus callosotomy, which has shown to be effective with atonic seizures. This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. There are several procedures that have shown efficacy:\n\nWhat are the different types of clinical seizures? Who is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? What tests are used to determine if a child is a candidate for epilepsy surgery? Who performs pediatric epilepsy surgery? What are the types of epilepsy surgery? Pediatric epilepsy surgery can be used to treat a highly selected group of patients whose seizures are not controllable by standard means. The appropriate candidate for epilepsy surgery must meet several criteria. There are currently three major categories of epilepsy surgery: resective surgery, corpus callosotomy, and implantation of the vagus nerve stimulator. In patients that meet the requirements for epilepsy surgery the results, in terms of seizure control, can be very positive with minimal side effects and complications. Epileptic seizures are the common and defining component of the disorder that is referred to as epilepsy. That is, an individual that has an isolated seizure as a result of an acute transient insult to the brain, for example a metabolic disorder, or a seizure observed after an acute trauma to the brain, would not be diagnosed as having epilepsy. The patient will collapse like a marionette when all its strings are cut at once. Many different clinical events can be seen with this type of seizure. This has important implications for the selection of the appropriate treatment, especially for the decision about the need for surgery. The symptoms already described in the simple partial seizures might be present and might be followed by complex automatic behaviors such as manipulating objects, walking around the room, or answering questions, usually done in a rumbling, difficult-to-understand language. When our second child was diagnosed with a serious, debilitating illness called infantile spasms, it seemed that our dream would be dashed. The morning of her appointment with her pediatrician Eliana was sitting in her baby seat and she had a series of the movements in a row. Many different disorders of the brain may be associated with epilepsy. For some patients the epileptic disorder is congenital, that is, the child is born with the predisposition to have epilepsy. In other patients, the epileptic disorder is acquired because of brain damage that occurred after birth. The congenital epilepsies could be the result of the child having a gene that is responsible for the epileptic disorder; these are the genetic types of epilepsy. Alternatively, congenital epilepsy may be the result\n\nHemispherectomy is a very rare neurosurgical procedure in which a cerebral hemisphere (half of the upper brain, or cerebrum) is removed, disconnected, or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients.

Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri-insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery. Patient criteria \nBecause of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. One such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. In one study of children under 5 who had this surgery to treat catastrophic epilepsy, 73.7% were freed of all seizures. The success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life. The conclusion: “adult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and most profit from surgery in several quality of life domains.”\n\nUltimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater. Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies. For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5. Previously, she had suffered from Rasmussen's encephalitis, which caused her to experience around 150 seizures a day.

Worldwide over 500 million doses were administered between 1999 and 2004, and 575 million doses have been administered since the vaccine's introduction worldwide. Rates of disease have been seen to increase in populations that go unvaccinated. Side effects of immunization are generally mild and go away without any specific treatment. Because it contains live viruses, the MMR vaccine is not recommended during pregnancy but may be given while breastfeeding. Being recently immunized does not increase the risk of passing measles, mumps, or rubella on to others. There is no evidence of an association between MMR immunisation and autistic spectrum disorders. The MMR vaccine is a mixture of live weakened viruses of the three diseases. The MMRV vaccine, which also covers chickenpox, may be used instead. Medical use Cochrane concluded that the \"Existing evidence on the safety and effectiveness of MMR and MMRV vaccine supports current policies of mass immunisation aimed at global measles eradication in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with measles mumps rubella and varicella.\" Fewer than 200 cases have been reported in the U.S. each year between 1997 and 2013, and the disease is no longer considered endemic there. Between 2000 and 2013, measles vaccination resulted in a 75% decrease in deaths from the disease. This individual returned to a community with many unvaccinated children. The resulting outbreak infected 34 people, mostly children and virtually all unvaccinated; 9% were hospitalized, and the cost of containing the outbreak was estimated at $167,685. A major epidemic was averted due to high rates of vaccination in the surrounding communities. Rubella Rubella, also known as German measles, was also very common before widespread vaccination. Mumps Mumps is another viral disease that was once very common, especially during childhood. Administration The MMR vaccine is administered by a subcutaneous injection, the first dose typically at 12 months of age. Safety Adverse reactions, rarely serious, may occur from each component of the MMR vaccine. Anaphylaxis is an extremely rare but serious allergic reaction to the vaccine. In 2014, the FDA approved two additional possible adverse events on the vaccination label: acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), and transverse myelitis, with permission to also add \"difficulty walking\" to the package inserts. This report also rejected any connection between the MMR vaccine and autism. The number of reports on neurological disorders is very small, other than evidence for an association between a form of the MMR vaccine containing the Urabe mumps strain and rare adverse events of aseptic meningitis, a form of viral meningitis. The UK National Health Service stopped using the Urabe mumps strain in the early 1990s due to cases of transient mild viral meningitis, and switched to a form using the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain instead. The Urabe strain remains in use in a number of countries; MMR with the Urabe strain is much cheaper to manufacture than with the Jeryl Lynn strain, and a strain with higher efficacy along with a somewhat higher rate of mild side effects may still have the advantage of reduced incidence of overall adverse events. A Cochrane review found that, compared with placebo, MMR vaccine was associated with fewer upper respiratory tract infections, more irritability, and a similar number of other adverse effects. published a fraudulent paper about twelve children, reportedly with bowel symptoms and autism or other disorders acquired soon after administration of MMR vaccine, while supporting a competing vaccine. In 2010, Wakefield's research was found by the General Medical Council to have been \"dishonest\", and The Lancet fully retracted the paper. Three months following The Lancet's retraction, Wakefield was struck\n\nThere have been claims suggesting a potential relationship between the MMR vaccine and the development of autism in children with bowel symptoms. These claims were initially proposed by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues, who hypothesized that the measles virus from the vaccine could lodge in the gut of susceptible children, damaging the bowel and causing autism. However, it is important to note that the claim made by Dr. Wakefield and his colleagues has been extensively discredited. Numerous studies and scientific research have been conducted to investigate this claim, and no credible evidence has been found to support a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. However, it is crucial to understand that this study did not establish a causal relationship between the MMR vaccine and autism. It merely aimed to characterize these bowel findings in children with autism. Overall, the vast majority of scientific evidence and reputable medical authorities, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), strongly support the safety and effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. The MMR vaccine has been administered to millions of children worldwide and has proven to be an essential tool in preventing measles, mumps, and rubella. It is widely accepted in the medical community that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypothesis, which has been disproven. After two doses, 97% of people are protected against measles, 88% against mumps, and at least 97% against rubella.

Mozambique’s National Director of Medical Care says vaccination campaign has succeeded in covering 84% of the target. The deputy representative for UNICEF in Mozambique, Michel Le Pechoux said there are still more than thirty-five hundred confirmed cases. The findings, which were presented at the assembly of the European Geo-Sciences Union in Vienna on Monday, showed most groundwater in the two slums contains traces of Harpis virus, Pox virus and Papilloma virus.

Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. Other potential risks identified include typhoid, another water-borne disease, and diarrheal diseases. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. Mozambique health officials reported at least 2,700 cases of diarrhoea by 26 March. The Red Cross described the risk of major outbreaks \n\n Multiple aid agencies have highlighted the urgent need to supply clean water to people in the area, warning of the risk of disease. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. On 1 April, the World Health Organization provided 884,953 cholera vaccines and 900,000 bed nets to Mozambique.

Global organizations, researchers, public health officials, countries, government officials, and clinicians have previously worked together to create effective measures of infection control and subsequent treatment. Without the collaborative efforts of such entities, the world would not have the vaccines and treatments we now possess for diseases that were once considered deadly such as tuberculosis, tetanus, polio, influenza, etc. Historically, science diplomacy has proved successful in diseases such as SARS, Ebola, Zika and continues to be relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic today. Quarantine measures were highly impacted by commercial interests, however. As such, quarantines were effective, but their unsystematic nature made them unduly oppressive. He suggested banning arbitrary increases in quarantines. Much of the convention was spent debating whether cholera was contagious and whether quarantines were effective against cholera. The virus that causes SARS is known as SARS-associated Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly contagious, producing sometimes fatal respiratory illnesses. In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 8098 infections and 774 deaths. Only 8 tested positive for SARS-CoV in the United States at the time. The collaborative efforts by organizations, countries, researchers and public health officials all over the world led to containment of the virus within about 5–6 months. WHO first announced a global alert for a severe pneumonia-like disease on March 12. WHO also utilized the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN), developed for WHO by Health Canada, to improve the speed of outbreak detection and advance the response time. These experts represented around 20 different organizations and 15 different nationalities and worked in several sectors to contain the virus. Epidemiologists of varied backgrounds also worked together to review the measures to control the spread of the virus as well as analyze the behavior of the virus in transmission. Such epidemiologists hailed from the Health Protection Agency (United Kingdom), the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (Japan), the Robert Koch-Institut (Germany) and more. In addition, researchers from laboratories around the world shared their findings with each other in hopes of gaining better understanding of the disease to test possible vaccines for SARS. The CDC had promptly activated its Emergency Operations Center (EOC) just days after WHO's global alert and informed the public of this novel disease while providing precautionary protocols to avoid infection. Researchers in a 2005 journal proposed possible methods of vaccine development noting the possibility of an inactivated SARS-CoV based vaccine. Nonetheless, collaborative efforts around SARS lead to major advancements in global public health. After SARS, the U.S. Department of Human and Health Services \"amended the regulations to streamline the process of adding future emerging infectious diseases.\" Collaboration between the U.S and China also improved after SARS as Tommy Thompson, U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services visited China in October 2003 and \"signed a multiyear partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to develop a more robust public health infrastructure in China. Thompson also established an HHS health attaché at the U.S. embassy in Beijing.\" Collaborative efforts were crucial to the containment of SARS. A second resolution to improve International Health Regulations gave WHO the authority to take a much stronger role in case of infectious diseases that pose a threat to public health. This allowed WHO to act and respond to outbreaks using its own resources rather than waiting for official government notifications of outbreaks. Science diplomats traveled the world and worked with scientists from other countries in the hope of finding a vaccine to conquer the Ebola outbreak. Scientists first discovered the Ebola virus in 1976 in Democratic Republic of Congo.

Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, the general public and the scientific community in \n\nScience diplomacy is the collaborative efforts by local and global entities to solve global issues using science and technology as a base. This allows even conflicting nations to come together through science to find solutions to global issues.
