According to American Cancer Society, 4.3 million new cancer cases were reported in China in 2015 and this number is continuously increasing year-on-year. Economies of China and Japan are among the largest markets for cryoablation devices, given their large geriatric population. As per United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (U.N. DESA), there were 125 million people aged 80 years or over in 2015, which is expected to increase to 434 million by 2050. According to W.H.O, in 2017, cancer is one of the leading causes for morbidity and mortality around the globe, with around 14 million cases in 2012, the number of new cancer cases is expected to increase by 70% by 2030.

According to American Cancer Society, 4.3 million new cancer cases were reported in China in 2015. Furthermore, around 2.7 to 6.1 million people were suffering from atrial fibrillation in 2013-14 in the U.S., the high incidence of cardiac disorders such as cardiac arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter is the another factor leading to the growth of cryoablation devices market. The growing aging population and obesity rate are the major risk factor for atrial fibrillation. As per W.H.O., worldwide obesity has more than doubled and it is reached to more than 1.9 billion obese population in 2014 from 1980, as well as around 41 million children under the age of 5 were obese in 2014 and this number is continuously on rise in emerging countries. As per the stats of W.H.O. around 10.6 million children who are obese found in Africa in 2014, also close to half of the children under 5 who were obese lived in Asia in 2014. This increase in number of obese population in emerging countries will support to expand the customer base for companies in untapped market.

Since then CSL has provided Australians with rapid access to 20th century medical advances including insulin and penicillin, and vaccines against influenza, polio and other infectious diseases. CSL Limited was incorporated in 1991 and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) in 1994. It is a transcontinental partner in pandemic preparedness and response, and a leading supplier of influenza vaccines to global markets for both northern and southern hemisphere seasons. As growth stocks have outperformed the broader market over the last few years (notwithstanding recent share price falls) investors have become acclimatised to CSL’s steep share price inclines. Despite this, CSL has managed to outperform key industry peer Cochlear (+15% over 1 year) due do its strong economic moat and the projected long term growth thematic in its plasma and influenza businesses. R&D is focused in Australia; revenue is primarily derived from the northern hemisphere. CSL have had 5 major product launches across all divisions over the last 12 months, focused mainly around influenza vaccines – it has been a huge achievement for the company and the highest number t in its history. They are making meaningful contributions to the business now and will continue to do so in the future.

CSL is Australia’s largest healthcare business with exposure to international and domestic healthcare spend. It is the number one and preferred player in the market; working alongside governments to provide the best healthcare possible for the masses. Revenue grew by 11% to $10.6 billion, earnings per share (EPS) increased by 29% to $5.25 and the total full year dividend grew by 26% to $3.09 per share. It invests heavily in research and development to create the next products that will help people, drive profits and strengthen political goodwill. For smaller developers, CSL provide scale, and thus have first right of refusal when new products come to market. Management remain positive on revenue growth from both new and existing products and have a history of consistently outperforming expectations.\n\n ''' Melbourne is Australia's second largest city and has a diverse and multicultural population. Melbourne dominated Australia's population growth for the 15th year in a row as of 2017, adding 125,424 people between 2016 and 2017, and boomed past 5 million people in 2019. Population growth is however projected to significantly decline as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic slowdown. Melbourne has the 10th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas. In Greater Melbourne at the 2016 census, 63.3% of residents were born in Australia. Melbourne is home to residents from 200 countries and territories, who speak over 233 languages and dialects and follow 116 religious faiths. The earliest known inhabitants of the broad area that later became known as Melbourne were Indigenous Australians – specifically, at the time of European settlement, the Bunurong, Wurundjeri and Wathaurong tribal groups. Melbourne is still a centre of Aboriginal life — consisting of local groups and indigenous groups from other parts of Australia, as most indigenous Victorians were displaced from their traditional lands during colonization – with the Aboriginal community in the city numbering over 20,000 persons (0.6% of the population). Adelaide's inhabitants are known as Adelaideans. Compared with Australia's other state capitals, Adelaide is growing at a rate similar to Sydney, Canberra, and Hobart (see List of cities in Australia by population). In 2020, it had a metropolitan population (including suburbs) of more than 1,376,601, making it Australia's fifth-largest city. Some 77% of the population of South Australia are residents of the Adelaide metropolitan area, making South Australia one of the most centralised states. Major areas of population growth in recent years have been in outer suburbs such as Mawson Lakes and Golden Grove. Adelaide's inhabitants occupy 366,912 houses, 57,695 semi-detached, \n\nDementia is a form of disease that affects the functioning of the brain resulting in decline in memory or other thinking skills. Accumulation of a protein called beta amyloid, in the spaces between nerve cells due to genetic mutation is a major cause of dementia. For instance, according to World Population Prospects (WPP) published by United Nations in 2017, around 962 million people aged 60 years and above were recorded, which accounted for 13 percent of the global population. The number is projected to reach 1.4 billion by 2030, exhibiting annual growth rate of 3 percent. Europe accounts for the largest geriatric population (25% of population) in 2017, Asia Pacific also had geriatric population of 547 million people in 2017 and it is projected to reach 900 million by 2025. Asia Pacific is expected to emerge as a major market in the near future, majorly due to the growing geriatric population and Alzheimer’s disease cases, especially in China, India. This in turn, is expected to create lucrative opportunities for growth of the market. For instance, according to Alzheimer’s Disease International Association, in 2015, East Asia is the region with the maximum number of people living with dementia (9.8 million), followed by Western Europe (7.4 million). For instance, according to Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2013, five million people were suffering from AD and the number is expected to rise up to 14 million by 2050, in the U.S. Moreover, according to World Health Organization (WHO), 2017, around 47 million people suffer from dementia and around 10 million new cases are reported annually. According to Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) estimates, the number of people with dementia is expected to reach to around 400,000 by 2020, and around 900,000 by 2050. Moreover, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is working in collaboration with the Australian Research Council (ARC) to prioritize and fund new dementia research projects and translate research to improve prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and care for dementia patients.\n\nQuestion: To the nearest million what is the population of Australia?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The official ballot title states its intention as \"BILL REPEALING PRESENT LIQUOR LAW; AUTHORIZING PRIVATE SALE, LICENSED, TAXED.\" After the repeal of prohibition by the Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 5, 1933, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) was established to regulate and control the sales and consumption of alcoholic liquor in Oregon. The US, along with only a handful of other countries, maintains the highest drinking age worldwide at 21 (known as the Minimum Legal Drinking Age of 21, or MLDA-21). In 1984, the United States Congress passed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act (NMDAA), which penalized any state which allowed persons under the age of 21 to purchase alcoholic beverages by reducing that state's annual federal highway apportionment. In 1985, South Dakota challenged the NMDAA, but in 1987 the Supreme Court ruled the Act was constitutional for the purchase of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, the Court indicated that the States still had the right to set \n\n American attitudes towards drugs and alcoholic beverages have evolved considerably throughout the country's history.

She subsequently changed her daughter's name from Norma Jeane Mortenson to Norma Jeane Baker, which would later be replaced by Marilyn Monroe when the actress began her career in Hollywood.

Like boxing rings, wrestling rings are also known by the poetic name of the \"squared circle\", which derives from how combative exhibitions would often be held in a roughly drawn circle on the ground. Around the ring are three ring ropes, one fewer than modern boxing rings, which have had four ropes since the 1970s. Boxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. Boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general. ; A special pair of \"shoes\" is worn by the wrestler to increase his mobility and flexibility. ; \"Headgear\", equipment worn around the ears to protect the wrestler, is optional in Greco-Roman. Headgear is omitted at the participant's own risk, as there is the potential to develop cauliflower ear.\n\nQuestion: Why is the site of a boxing match called a ring when it's square?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Although others were not as enthusiastic about the idea, he was allowed to hold his marathon. Of the 58 who started the race, only 38 reached the finish line, a finish line on a course that was later \n\n The race was the idea of Tommy Leonard, an avid runner and popular bartender in Boston and Falmouth. During the 1972 Summer Olympics Leonard closed his bar in order to watch Frank Shorter win the first Olympic marathon for the United States since 1908. After Shorter won the marathon Leonard was quoted as saying \"Wouldn't it be fantastic if we could get Frank Shorter to run in a race on Cape Cod?\" One year later, in the summer of 1973, with the help of a local high school track coach John Carroll, and the town's recreation director Rich Sherman, the first Falmouth Road Race was run by approximately 100 people. The next year there were 445 runners, and the year after that Frank Shorter joined 850 other runners in the race, bringing Leonard's wish true. Robbins completed his 50th consecutive Manchester Road Race in 2001 and participated in 20 Boston Marathons. In April 1944 he finished third in 2:38:31 at Boston to four-time winner Canada's Gérard Côté and two-time champion (and seven-time runner up) John A. Kelley. Nine years later, he ran Boston in 2:43:56. On November 12, 1944, while in the U.S. Navy, he also won the U.S. national marathon championship at the Yonkers marathon, running 2:40.48.6. The first marathon was perhaps a 25 mile run by Pheidippides, a Greek soldier who ran to Athens from the town of Marathon, Greece to deliver news of a battle victory over the Persians in 490 B.C. Thousands of years later, marathon running became part of world sports, starting at the inaugural Marathon in the 1896 Modern Olympic Games. The number of marathons in the United States has grown over 45 times in this period.\n\nQuestion: In the very first Boston Marathon, 15 runners competed.

The previous badge was two balls in front of green coloured Libya's map which is also in front of a sun. During late 2011 and early 2012 the Libyan team wore white jerseys temporarily in their qualification games and 2012 Africa Cup of Nations. In 2014, Libya replaced the green socks worn by the players with black ones. regions of Libya: Fezzan (red), Cyrenaica (black), and Tripolitania (green). Under Muammar Gaddafi's leadership, Libya had a red-white-black flag from 1969 to 1977, and it was replaced by the all-green flag from 1977 to 2011, during which it was the only flag in the world to have one color and no design. During the Libyan Civil War against the rule of Muammar Gaddafi, the 1951–69 flag – as well as various makeshift versions without the crescent and star symbol, or without the green stripe – came back into use in areas held by the Libyan opposition and by protesters at several Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. The flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis has similar colors, arranged diagonally and separated by yellow lines. The flag of Libya descends from the pan-Arab colors, while the flag of the former Islamic Republic of Afghanistan was independently derived. Green on some African flags represents the natural richness of Africa. Many flags of the Islamic world are green, as the color is considered sacred in Islam (see below). The flag of Hamas, as well as the flag of Iran, is green, symbolizing their Islamist ideology.

A number of private for profit clinics (\"Cabinets Médical Privé\") operate in Niamey. Niamey makes up a special capital district of Niger, which is surrounded by the Region of Tillabéri. Communauté Urbaine de Niamey, or CUN). Like the rest of Niger, Niamey has seen a decentralisation of governance since 2000. Government Ordinance n°2010–56 and Presidential Decree n°2010-679 of September 2010 mandated an elected City Council for the city of Niamey, subsumed under the CUN. The inhabitants are called ouagalais. It is served by an international airport and is linked by rail to Abidjan in the Ivory Coast and, for freight only, to Kaya. There are several highways linking the city to Niamey, Niger, south to Ghana, and southwest to Ivory Coast. Other attractions include the National Museum of Burkina Faso, the Moro-Naba Palace (site of the Moro-Naba Ceremony), the National Museum of Music, and several craft markets. Nouakchott (نواكشوط;, originally derived from , \"place of the winds\") is the capital and largest city of Mauritania. It is one of the largest cities in the Sahel. Nouakchott was a mid-sized village of little importance until 1958, when it was chosen as the capital of the nascent nation of Mauritania. However, beginning in the 1970s, a vast number of Mauritanians began moving to Nouakchott because environmental conditions in their home villages had become too harsh due to drought and increasing desertification. The city is the hub of the Mauritanian economy. It is home to a deepwater port and Nouakchott–Oumtounsy International Airport, one of the country's two international airports.

Its mandate was to get \"information on how foreign subversive propaganda entered the U.S. and the organizations that were spreading it\". In 1934, the Special Committee subpoenaed most of the leaders of the fascist movement in the United States. Beginning in November 1934, the committee investigated allegations of a fascist plot to seize the White House, known as the \"Business Plot\". The Bundschuh was to serve as a Europe-wide information network of \"high-grade\" agents that could be used by sabotage and terrorist organizations as they waged a guerrilla war against the Allies.

It was re-made in 1979. ; The Tuttles of Tahiti (1942) with Charles Laughton, was based on the novel No More Gas. ; Passage to Marseille (1944) directed by Michael Curtiz and starring Humphrey Bogart, was based on Men Without Country. ; High Barbaree (1947) with Van Johnson and June Allyson was based on the novel of the same name. The Nordhoff–Hall books were the source for both the 1935 and the 1962 MGM films, Mutiny on the Bounty. The 1984 film, The Bounty, was based on other sources, more well-researched views of the actual events of 1789 in which the mutiny results not from maltreatment by Captain Bligh but from the lure of South Pacific life for the ship's crew. The novel begins with the Rigonda family and two men aboard a castaway ship somewhere in the south Pacific. The family finds a hidden cache of food and they land safely on a nearby island. The twenty who survived the ordeal were warmly received upon their return to post-war Japan. These sensationalized depictions produced a backlash in popular opinion and sympathy for the survivors cooled. This “rapid transformation of the political and social climate” influenced perceptions of Sternberg's Saga of Anatahan in Japan.\n\nQuestion: Men Against the Sea and Pitcairn's Island were two sequels to what famous novel?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Due to its geographical position, Osaka's international ferry connections are far greater than that of Tokyo, with international service to Shanghai, Tianjin, Korea along with domestic routes to Kitakyushu, Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Okinawa. In the Izu Islands, Ōshima Airport on Ōshima, Hachijōjima Airport on Hachijō, and Miyakejima Airport on Miyake provide air services. Ibaraki Airport, located 85 km north of Tokyo, was positioning itself as a hub for low-cost carriers, flights from here to Sapporo seem to be the most popular. Shizuoka Airport, 175 km southwest of Tokyo, aims to be a more convenient alternative for Shizuoka residents than airports in Tokyo or Nagoya, however none of the above airports have shown to take away any significant traffic from Narita or Haneda and continue to play minor roles.

Stationed at Hsinchu AB:\n\n The airport opened in 1972, replacing a former Imperial Japanese Navy airfield in the Kamoike area near the city center, which had served as the city's main airport since 1957. The site of the former airport was re-developed as a \"new town\" with office buildings and high-density housing projects, and is now the site of the Kagoshima Prefecture government office, among other buildings. The airport's runway had an initial length of 2,500 m, which was extended to 3,000 m in 1980. Air Niugini, Cathay Pacific Airways, China Airlines and Nauru Airlines provided international service to Kagoshima from the 1970s to the 1980s, and JAL operated a route to Singapore via Hong Kong and Bangkok during the 1980s.

The Canada Line travels \n\n The Burrard Street Bridge (sometimes referred to as the Burrard Bridge) is a four-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930–1932 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The high, five part bridge on four piers spans False Creek, connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends. The other two bridges are the Granville Bridge, three blocks or 0.5 km to the southeast, and the Cambie Street Bridge, about 11 blocks or 2 km to the east. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4200 ft between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the \"Bay Bridge\"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 ft wide by 58 ft high. Two road bridges (the Lions' Gate Bridge and Ironworkers Memorial Second Narrows Crossing) connect to the city of Vancouver and the Trans-Canada Highway. The only other road access is by way of Highway 99 from the north or the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal from Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast. The function of the pylons is performed by the sculptured cast-iron frames (frames), attached with anchor bolts through the masonry to a wooden grille, compressed from above and below by massive cast-iron slabs, to which supporting chains are attached [19] [10].

Matthau narrated the Doctor Seuss Video Classics: How the Grinch Stole Christmas! His partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most enduring collaborations in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making The Fortune Cookie and would make a total of 10 movies together—11 counting Kotch, in which Lemmon has a cameo as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the Oliver Stone drama, JFK (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy Grumpy Old Men (1993), co-starring Ann-Margret, and its sequel, Grumpier Old Men (1995), also co-starring Sophia Loren. Walter Matthau (born Walter John Matthow; October 1, 1920 – July 1, 2000) was an American actor. Matthau won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the Billy Wilder film The Fortune Cookie (1966).

Instead, Dierkes went to work for the U.S. Treasury Department which coincidentally sent him to Hollywood to function as technical advisor for the film To the Ends of the Earth (1948) and Orson Welles cast him as Ross in his version of Macbeth in the same year. Welles used Dierkes again in his Touch of Evil (1958). He began his career in 1950 and started television and film work with roles in 12 Angry Men (1957) and Cry Terror! (1958). Dietrich Mattausch was born on April 26, 1940, in Leitmeritz, Sudetenland (now Litoměřice, Czech Republic).

Interestingly, Chevalier Jackson (JMC class of 1886, lived 1865-1958) was one of the foremost figures responsible for developing esophagoscopy and laryngobronchoscopy. In his Philadelphia bronchoscope clinic he trained numerous students and physicians in his techniques. During the 1920s, Jackson also began a crusade to spread knowledge of preventive measures to protect children from inhaling foreign objects. A fifth generation physician, John H. Gibbon was born in Philadelphia in 1903. Gibbon received his MD from Jefferson Medical College in 1927 and completed his internship at Pennsylvania Hospital in 1929. It was during his research fellowship at Harvard in the early 1930s that Gibbon initially conceived the idea of an apparatus that could temporarily assume the functions of a patient's heart and lungs. The pulmonary conferences continued after the closing of the Barton Memorial Hospital at Broad and Fitzwater, when the Pulmonary Division was moved to the main campus. The facility, identified as “Little Jeff” was organized as a hospital with medical, nursing and social service personnel to provide care for patients with active tuberculosis. This institution reflected the activities of Lawrence F. Flick (JMC 1879) who founded the 1st State Society for Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1892. In 1895, the Free Hospital for Poor Consumptives, in 1901 the White Haven Sanatorium and in 1903 the Henry Phipps Institute came into being. Dr. Flick was described as the “White Knight fighting the White Plague” by his colleagues and was an early proponent of the contagiousness of tuberculosis. In 1927 Burgess L. Gordon (JMC 1919) was appointed to the Directorship of the Department of the Diseases of the Chest and was succeeded in 1951 by Martin J. Sokoloff (JMC 1920) who concurrently was an Attending Physician at White Haven Sanatorium and the Chief of the Division of Tuberculosis Control of the Philadelphia Department of Health. In 1946, White Haven Sanatorium merged with Jefferson Medical College while concurrently, the Barton Memorial Division of Jefferson Medical College Hospital opened at Broad and Fitzwater Streets for the treatment of tuberculosis. In 1956, the Department of the Diseases of the Chest became the Barton Memorial Division of the Department of Medicine. The Anthracite Health and Welfare Fund funded a pulmonary physiology laboratory under the directorship of Hurley L. Motley, MD. G. William Atkinson (’70 PG) became the Director of the Pulmonary Laboratory in 1970 and Director of the Barton Division in 1974. James Wilson became the Chief of the Barton Memorial Division in 1983 but his tenure was shortened by his sudden demise. The successful group included Drs. The “old guard” of the Fish era all departed largely to go to Wake Forest. He established a reputation in several lung disorders including asthma, sarcoidosis and pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. During the initial 50 years, the focus was not only managing tuberculosis but also the public health aspects and controlling this disease. This was rapidly followed by the development of acute and chronic ventilatory support and respiratory care units that progressed to identifying critical care\n\n The history of Antarctica emerges from early Western theories of a vast continent, known as Terra Australis, believed to exist in the far south of the globe. The term Antarctic, referring to the opposite of the Arctic Circle, was coined by Marinus of Tyre in the 2nd century AD. The rounding of the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn in the 15th and 16th centuries proved that Terra Australis Incognita (\"Unknown Southern Land\"), if it existed, was a continent in its own right. In 1773, James Cook and his crew crossed the Antarctic Circle for the first time; however, although they discovered nearby islands, they did not catch sight of Antarctica itself. It is believed he was as close as 240 km from the mainland. On 27 January 1820, a Russian expedition led by Fabian Gottlieb von Bellingshausen and \n\n Between 1839 and 1843 Royal Naval Captain James Clark Ross, commanding his two ships HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, completed three voyages to the Antarctic continent. During this time he discovered and explored a new sector of the Antarctic that would provide the field of work for many later British expeditions. Ross established the general geography of this region, and named many of its features; the Ross Sea, the Great Ice Barrier (later renamed the Ross Ice Shelf), Ross Island, Cape Adare, Victoria Land, McMurdo Sound, Cape Crozier and the twin volcanoes Mount Erebus and Mount Terror. He returned to the Barrier several times, hoping to penetrate it, but was unable to do so, achieving his Farthest South in a small Barrier inlet at \n\nDr. Jerri Lin Nielsen (née Cahill; March 1, 1952 – June 23, 2009) was an American physician with extensive emergency room experience, who self-treated her breast cancer while stationed at Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station in Antarctica until she could be evacuated safely.

Ares was held screaming and howling in the urn until Hermes rescued him, and Artemis tricked the Aloadae into slaying each other. In Nonnus's Dionysiaca Ares also killed Ekhidnades, the giant son of Echidna, and a great enemy of the gods. \"It produced a sound as from myriad roaring dragons (Iliad, 4.17) and was borne by Athena in battle ... and among them went bright-eyed Athene, holding the precious aegis which is ageless and immortal: a hundred tassels of pure gold hang fluttering from it, tight-woven each of them, and each the worth of a hundred oxen.\" Virgil imagines the Cyclopes in Hephaestus' forge, who \"busily burnished the aegis Athena wears in her angry moods—a fearsome thing with a surface of gold like scaly snake-skin, and the linked serpents and the Gorgon herself upon the goddess's breast—a severed head rolling its eyes\", furnished with golden tassels and bearing the Gorgoneion (Medusa's head) in the central boss. Out of sadness and regret, she created the palladium, a statue in the likeness of Pallas, and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it.

Given that the Delphic oracle warned Laius not to have a son because that son was fated to kill his own father, Laius exposed his newborn son - who nevertheless survived, and grew up under the name of Oedipus.\n\nQuestion: In Greek mythology, what were the names of Oedipus's parents?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix. The Marshall Plan (officially the European Recovery Program or ERP) was a system of American economic aid to Western Europe 1948–51. It played a major role in the economic recovery, modernization, and unification of Europe. The United States set up the European Recovery Program (Marshall Plan) to provide large-scale financial and economic aid for rebuilding Europe largely through grants rather than loans. In a speech at Harvard University on 5 June 1947, U.S. Secretary of State George Marshall stated: \"The breakdown of the business structure of Europe during the war was complete.

I travel a lot, and I heard of an outbreak of yellow fever in Uganda. What is this disease, and should I be worried? It’s further classified as an acute viral hemorrhagic disease; other such diseases include Ebola, Marburg, and Lassa fever. The total population living in these countries is more than 900 million. All these statistics would be much greater were it not for vaccination. The single most important prevention measure against yellow fever is vaccination. Enough to be vaccinated, and to encourage those who may be at risk to do likewise. The killers came on a Sabbath, brought onto the Seventh-day Adventist church’s compound by the mission president himself and his son, a physician who served as medical director of the church-owned Mugonero Hospital. MUGONERO ADVENTIST HOSPITAL: Some people ran toward the hospital, trying to escape the killing, but were caught by people waiting with machetes. People from all over the country descended on the compound to kill the Adventists. Some of the killers were Adventist. They came with grenades, machetes, knives, anything that could kill a human being. A pastor was preaching when killers entered his church. They first shot and killed him. My wife and children ran to the president’s house for help, but he turned them away. They even brought dogs to assist in searching the bush. The outbreak of the genocide made it impossible for me to return home. From Kigali I was taken by a group of soldiers to a camp for internally displaced people in a northern province of the country. Even though we were homeless, those who had some money gave tithe and offerings faithfully, as if they were still at home. Sometimes people from Uganda came to visit and gave us money, which we also tithed and used for offerings. We set aside the tithe until the church in Rwanda could begin working again, and we used the offerings to help treat people injured in the war. So I went throughout the city, pleading with people to return to church. Slowly people returned to the churches. My favorite Bible verse is John 3:16: “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” If God had not loved everyone in the world, I would have gone and killed the killers. The father has died, and the son remains incarcerated. When people speak badly about the killers, I remind them that we have a God who is patient with everyone. That’s the only thing that can help someone like me, who has gone through such circumstances. Anytime anyone comes to God and asks for forgiveness, God forgives. Daniel’s life is a story of God’s miraculous leading and providential guidance.

The brain was once thought to be the body's control tower, issuing commands to the other organs. This time we visited Oita Prefecture, where fewer people have died from colorectal cancer over the past 10 years than anywhere else in the country.

This unique National Geographic docudrama traces the life of a man, Adam, from the Cradle to the Grave, explaining the science behind our highs and lows, the rites of passage we all go through and exploring the inner workings of our bodies and how they change through time. The 90-year-old narrator, Adam, reflects on his life from conception through boyhood, adolescence and beyond, revealing the events that shape him. Along the way we meet the class bully, Adam's first love and the sergeant major preparing him and fellow recruits for Vietnam. One in five families eat convenience foods at least three times a week and a government survey showed only one in six mothers cook from scratch every day. It’s no surprise; they are cheap, convenient and easy. If you were told you could get fit with just a few minutes of exercise a week would you believe it? Over your lifetime you undergo an extraordinary change - no other animal on earth goes through such a dramatic metamorphosis. In recent years, eating has become a health hazard. And we still continue to consume these products in ever greater quantities. So, why do we consume so much processed food and why are we so hooked on it? How exactly does the relentless agribusiness keep us coming back for more? How does it mold our tastes, influence our cravings and feed our addictions? They are even involved in government campaigns on nutrition and health. We will hear from scientists tracking sugar addiction, the businessmen playing on our weaknesses, legal experts preparing to challenge the might of the industry, and simple lovers of good food.

But the good East Wind and the kindly Moon have taken me on rapturous journeys high above the world to get an enchanted view of things.

We see this commonly, I told him. Additionally, if there’s one adage in medicine that’s both tragically true and unappreciated by laypeople it’s that interventions (like ventilators) to reverse or manage complications (like brainstem injury) frequently lead to more complications (like aspiration pneumonia). So many difficult questions confronted us, questions we needed to ask not just once but every day: which systems were improving? Which were worsening? Which could improve and which couldn’t? The answers changed every day as the enormous volume of data we collected on every aspect of his body’s function changed. We’re confronted by this problem in other contexts in medicine as well, however. Dementia, many people don’t realize, is uniformly fatal. Given enough time, all demented patients will become non-verbal and stop eating. At what point, then, do we withhold antibiotics for pneumonia, for example? Or insert a feeding tube (via the skin overlying the stomach) to augment declining nutrition? For a doctor lacking a personal connection to the human being their severely demented patient once was, these choices are difficult at best. For family members who retain a vivid picture of their loved one in full possession of all their faculties, they’re agonizing. We try to balance a reaction to today’s data and the interventions they suggest we make with the broader picture and the likely long-term outcome. Keeping a sharp eye on both, knowing which to believe more on any given day, is extremely challenging. But this is where the art of medicine lives and wisdom and compassion are most vitally required. In the end, my patient survived. Afterward, he required twenty-four hour care. But it wasn’t clear to me at that point if he would have even understood the question. I think I know his answer. Who would want to live like that? Not me and not anyone I have asked. Quality of life is much more important than quantity. And I believe God was telling this man it was his time to die. No one listened and he is paying the price! You have raised an interesting question, but there is one issue you haven’t addressed: money. However, my concern about money isn’t addressed to the first case you’ve presented, but to those you’ve mentioned in passing: patients well on the road to dementia—a condition you’ve noted is fatal. Why even begin? Yes, I am saying that at least partly, it’s a matter of money. (The NEJM agrees.) But the outcome—death—is the same. I don’t remember the author of this quote, but I think he had a point. It’s not enough to ask ALL patients’ families, What do you want done? We also need to help them understand that in some instances and at a certain point, interventions are futile. Society may pay the financial costs, but the patients pay dearly in suffering, confusion and lost quality of life. And especially, physicians need to convey that in the case of a demented patient, no intervention can ever bring back the person their loved one once was. So, how did the son/family feel about the outcome? Did your patient end up in a nursing home then? Or did family members assume his care?\n\nQuestion: \"According to Rudyard Kipling what were the \"\"two imposters\"\" to meet and treat the same day?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He inspired a number of actors significantly smaller and shorter (those with dwarfism) than most people, including Zelda Rubinstein, Eric the Actor, Mark Povinelli, and Ricardo Gil. As an adult, Dunn stood 3' 10\" and weighed about 78 pounds (117 cm, 35 kg). However, according to his Columbia Studios press kit biography, his studies were interrupted when he was knocked down a flight of stairs during a \"student rush\", which resulted in a three-month hospital stay. He also befriended actress Phoebe Dorin in an off-Broadway show, Two by Saroyan, in which both had small parts in the early 1960s. Eventually, on the advice of fellow actor Roddy McDowall, the pair started a nightclub act of songs mixed with conversational patter, titled \"Michael Dunn and Phoebe\". Dunn was probably best known for his recurring role on that series as Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a mad scientist who devised passionately perverse schemes and gadgetry to ensnare Secret Service agents James West and Artemus Gordon (Robert Conrad and Ross Martin). Dorin played Dr. Loveless's devoted assistant, Antoinette. In each episode in which they appeared together, the villainous couple tenderly sang a Victorian duet or two, heedless of the mayhem they had created around themselves. According to Dorin, Dunn saved her from drowning during filming of the episode \"The Night of the Murderous Spring\", plunging underwater to tear her free, when her costume became entangled in machinery used to sink a boat on the set.

In 1963, he received the New York critics' Circle Award for best supporting actor and was nominated for a 1964 Tony Award, for his performance as Cousin Lymon in Edward Albee's stage adaptation of The Ballad of the Sad Café, by Carson McCullers. Dunn received an Oscar nomination and the Laurel Award as the best supporting actor for his role as the cynical Karl Glocken in Ship of Fools (Columbia Pictures, 1965, directed by Stanley Kramer).

Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of Hockney's major aims—discussing the way human vision works. Some pieces are landscapes, such as Pearblossom Highway #2, others portraits, such as Kasmin 1982, and My Mother, Bolton Abbey, 1982. He was associated with the movement, but his early works display expressionist elements, similar to some works by Francis Bacon. When the RCA said it would not let him graduate if he did not complete an assignment of a life drawing of a female model in 1962, Hockney painted Life Painting for a Diploma in protest. He had refused to write an essay required for the final examination, saying he should be assessed solely on his artworks.

After successfully running for re-election five times, and becoming Chicago's longest-serving mayor, Richard M. Daley declined to run for a seventh term. The Daley family has had a strong presence in Chicago mayoral politics. Richard J. Daley and his son Richard M. Daley both served as mayor. Richard J. Daley's son (and Richard M. Daley's brother) William Daley unsuccessfully ran in the 2019 mayoral election, finishing third in the first round of voting. Hempstead Washburne ultimately won the election, with Elmer Washburn coming in fourth-place. While Byrne had previously, in 1979, presented herself as a protegee of former mayor Richard J. Daley, she now blamed him for many of the city's financial shortcomings. Daley's own son Richard M. Daley capitalized off a desire which many Chicagoans held (despite Byrne's criticisms) to return to what they perceived to have been comparatively stable years which the city had experienced under Richard J. Daley's leadership.

Despite there being a black candidate in the race, the Chicago Defender endorsed Daley, as did noted African American publisher John H. Johnson.

The British humorous magazine Punch (1841–2002) built on the success of Cruikshank's Comic Almanac (1827–1840) and employed many well-regarded illustrators, including Sir John Tenniel, the Dalziel Brothers, and Georges du Maurier. Historically, Punch was most influential in the 1840s and 1850s. The magazine was the first to use the term \"cartoon\" to describe a humorous illustration and its widespread use led to John Leech being known as the world's first \"cartoonist\". Richardson was born in London. He trained in the offices of Leonard Stokes and Frank T. Verity, practitioners of the Beaux-Arts style, and in 1906 he established his first architectural practice, in partnership with Charles Lovett Gill (the Richardson & Gill partnership was eventually dissolved in 1939). Punch was discouraging about his work, but in 1958 he succeeded in placing work with the \"William Hickey\" column in the Daily Express. Although in regular work, he left the Express after five years, seeing no prospects being in competition with Osbert Lancaster and Giles. In 1962 he began producing his trademark \"little man\" character for the Sunday Telegraph, and in 1979 he brought this as a regular and long-running contribution to The Times. Additionally, he made contributions to Cosmopolitan and House & Garden, as well as publishing some 20 books of his cartoons.

Willamette & Pacific Railroad provides freight rail service to the city, but there is no passenger rail in the city. There is public transportation via Yamhill Community Action Partnership with a bus to McMinnville. The New Airport station dome weighs 23 tons, has a diameter of 13.4 meters and a height of 8.5 meters. It was built on the ground and then lifted atop the station by a crane with a lifting capacity of 200 ton. An eight-foot, sandstone sculpture of Buddha is located inside the station underneath the dome. The MRT Blue Line presently runs from Tha Phra to Lak Song and has a carrying capacity of 40,000 people in each direction per hour. Similar to the Skytrain, the Metro uses trains supplied by Siemens which travel up to 80 km/h. Passengers can connect to the Skytrain at Si Lom, Sukhumvit and Chatuchak Park stations. The 48-kilometer-long MRT Blue line will serve as a circle line for Bangkok's metro rail system, providing connections to all other major lines, including the SRT Red Lines and the Airport Rail Link. So to ride the complete circle one has either to start at Tha Phra or change trains there. The 80 billion baht (US$3.2 billion) project was approved on 9 November 1990, without a feasibility study or clear timeline for completion, as a joint project of the Thai Ministry of Transport, the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), and the Thai subsidiary of Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong. There were to be three phases: the first a north–south line from Hua Lamphong Railway Station, Bangkok's main train station, to Don Mueang International Airport; the second an east–west line from Taling Chan District to Hua Mak; and the third a spur to the port. Totaling 60 km, all three were to be built on top of existing SRT train\n\nQuestion: In which country is the Sky Train Rail bridge?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Kennedy held an option and a managing interest, and moved to acquire control of the KAO theatres through quiet purchases of the company's stock. Paramount initially released it as a silent film, to accommodate smaller regional theaters that were not yet equipped for sound.

Amundsen named his camp Polheim and the entire plateau surrounding the Pole King Haakon VII Vidde in honour of King Haakon VII of Norway. Robert Falcon Scott had also returned to Antarctica with his second expedition, the Terra Nova Expedition, in a race against Amundsen to the Pole. In 1914 Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition set out with the goal of crossing Antarctica via the South Pole, but his ship, the Endurance, was frozen in pack-ice and sank 11 months later. The Terra Nova Expedition, officially the British Antarctic Expedition, was an expedition to Antarctica which took place between 1910 and 1913. Led by Captain Robert Falcon Scott, the expedition had various scientific and geographical objectives. The expedition, named after its supply ship, was a private venture financed by public contributions and a government grant. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, unable to find a safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as a liar and a rogue. The first attempt to find a route to the South Pole was made by British explorer Robert Falcon Scott on the Discovery Expedition of 1901–04. Scott, accompanied by Ernest Shackleton and Edward Wilson, set out with the aim of traveling as far south as possible, and on 31 December 1902, reached 82°16&prime; S.

Norgay went on to write Touching My Father's Soul, a book documenting his experiences on the summit attempt. The book was notable for the frankness with which it discussed the relationship between the often wealthy climbers and the Sherpas who obtain their incomes from assisting expeditions. Norgay's book was the first to discuss from the Sherpas' point of view of the disastrous May 1996 climbing season, in which twelve climbers died. It noted that little notice is taken when Sherpas die, but much attention is given when those lost are clients.

Lewis was Cash Box magazine's 1965 \"Male Vocalist of the Year\". The track would go on to top the Billboard Hot Adult Top 40 Tracks chart the week of August 8, becoming Thomas' third number one to date and extending Thomas' streak of top-five singles as a solo artist on the format to six (seven if including \"Smooth\", his collaboration with Santana). Garrett brought them to a recording studio with the song \"This Diamond Ring\" in a session financed by Jerry Lewis' wife Patti. It has been reported that The Playboys were not allowed to play their own instruments in the studio, but Lewis has since denied this. Garrett wanted to maximize the chances for a hit, so he insisted on using experienced session musicians for the overdubs, which included guitar and keyboard solos, additional bass and drum overdubs, and timpani. These musicians included Mike Deasy and Tommy Allsup on guitars, Leon \n\n on many Phil Spector productions, including recordings by the Ronettes, the Crystals, and Darlene Love and in the 1963 A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector album. He can be seen in the 1964 concert film T.A.M.I. Soon after, he was hired as Snuff Garrett's assistant and creative developer, playing on numerous number-one singles, including \"This Diamond Ring\" by Gary Lewis & the Playboys.

However, there is considerable debate concerning the accurate number of projected deaths that have yet to have occurred due to the disaster's long-term health effects; long-term death estimates range from up to 4,000 (per the 2005 and 2006 conclusions of a joint consortium of the United Nations) for the most exposed people of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, to 16,000 cases in total for all those exposed on the entire continent of Europe, with figures as high as 60,000 when including the relatively minor effects around the globe. This no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Note also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. Differing direct, short-term death toll counts Initially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. For their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia. 2005 and 2006 UN reports debate In August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\". However—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context. Others have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident. Liquidator mortality The uncertain and contested mortality rate of the Chernobyl liquidators is a major factor in the lack of consensus on the Chernobyl disaster's accurate death toll. Following the disaster itself, the Soviet Union organized an effort to stabilize and seal off the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of an estimated 600,000 \"liquidators\" recruited or conscripted from all over the Soviet Union. Since the 1990s—when the declassification of selected liquidator records prompted some direct participants to speak publicly—some with direct involvement in the liquidators' cleanup efforts have asserted that several thousand liquidators died as a result of the cleanup. The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low. For their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health. Long-latency diseases Issues related to identifying and tracking long-latency diseases have presented another stumbling block to reaching consensus on deaths beyond the immediate fatalities directly attributable to the initial reactor explosion and subsequent ARS. In the years since the accident, delayed, post-disaster deaths due to solid cancers, leukemia, and other long-latency diseases that might be attributable to the accident's release of radioactive debris have remained an ongoing concern. Addressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated\n\nThe was a series of equipment failures, nuclear meltdowns, and releases of radioactive materials at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant, following the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami on 11 March 2011. It was the largest nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and the radiation released exceeded official safety guidelines. Despite this, there were no deaths caused by acute radiation syndrome. As of year 2016, among those deaths, 1,368 have been listed as \"related to the nuclear power plant\" according to media analysis. According to UNSCEAR, evacuation and sheltering measures to protect the public significantly reduced potential radiation exposures by “a factor of 10”. As of 2020, the total number of cancer and leukemia instances has risen to six cases according to the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Summary of events The plant comprises six separate boiling water reactors originally designed by General Electric (GE), and maintained by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Immediately after the earthquake, the remaining reactors 1–3 shut down automatically, and emergency generators came online to control electronics and coolant systems. At this point, only prompt flooding of the reactors with seawater could have cooled the reactors quickly enough to prevent meltdown. Salt water flooding was delayed because it would ruin the costly reactors permanently. Flooding with seawater was finally commenced only after the government ordered that seawater be used, and at this point it was already too late to prevent meltdown. In the hours and days that followed, Reactors 1, 2 and 3 experienced full meltdown. In the intense heat and pressure of the melting reactors, a reaction between the nuclear fuel metal cladding and the remaining water surrounding them produced explosive hydrogen gas. Concerns about the atmospheric venting of radioactive gasses, and the occurrence of the large hydrogen explosion at unit 1 led to a -radius evacuation around the plant. The Japanese government and TEPCO have been criticized in the foreign press for poor communication with the public and improvised cleanup efforts. On 16 December 2011, Japanese authorities declared the plant to be stable, although it would take decades to decontaminate the surrounding areas and to decommission the plant altogether. Radiation release Experts estimate the total amount of radioactivity released into the atmosphere was approximately one-tenth as much as was released during the Chernobyl disaster. Measurements taken by the Japanese government 30–50 km from the plant showed caesium-137 levels high enough to cause concern, leading the government to ban the sale of food grown in the area. In May 2012, TEPCO reported that at least 900 PBq had been released \"into the atmosphere in March, 2011 alone\". Tepco admitted for the first time on 12 October 2012 that it had failed to take stronger measures to prevent disasters for fear of inviting lawsuits or protests against its nuclear plants.

However considerable amount of time required for a bungee jumpers to be reel back up, in which time BASE jumpers are not allowed to jump, prompted the banning of bungee jumping at Bridge Day since 1994.

During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protégé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko was seen as a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. According to the official version of Basayev's death, the FSB, \n\n Mikhail Gorbachev became the party's general secretary in 1985 following an interregnum after the death of Leonid Brezhnev in 1982 when the party was led first by Yuri Andropov and then by Konstantin Chernenko. When Brezhnev died Andropov was proclaimed General Secretary within days and by the official coverage in the Soviet media it was clear that he was the leader. Andropov died on February 9, 1984 and Chernenko was elected his replacement on February 13 but Chernenko was a compromise stopgap candidate as Gorbachev – Andropov's protege – lacked sufficient support in the Politburo. However, Chernenko was already an ill man and his duties were increasingly carried out by others, particularly Gorbachev, who was nominated by Andrei Gromyko \n\n him with a drone, spotted his car approach a truck laden with explosives that the FSB had prepared, and by remote control triggered a detonator that the FSB had hidden in the explosives.

Before surgery, some children may be placed in traction, which is aimed at decreasing muscular contractions, to increase the chances of a successful closed reduction in DDH, or to stabilize and promote realignment of a fracture. Hip spicas are generally used for children from 6 months to 6 years of age. One of the most challenging aspects of caring for an incontinent child in a hip spica is keeping the cast clean and dry and maintaining healthy skin integrity. Nurses have an important role in preparing parents for discharge. Caring for the child in a hip spica at home can be very stressful, therefore it is essential that nurses provide the appropriate support and discharge education. An adductor tenotomy, which involves percutaneous lengthening of tendons, may also be performed. Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH): An abnormality in the development of the hip joint. The abnormality may be congenital or may develop during infancy or childhood. Femoral/Pelvic osteotomies: Usually performed on children with DDH greater than 18 months. The cutting and repositioning of bone required to reconstruct and safely maintain the hip in the reduced position. Open Reduction: Usually performed after failed closed reduction in children greater than 2 years. Involves lengthening tendons, removing obstacles to reduction and tightening the hip capsule. Patients who have had a closed reduction usually only require oral analgesia. Evaluate patients’ skin integrity regularly. Children who have had an open reduction or osteotomy may have significant swelling in the groin area. If tolerating clear fluids, diet can be upgraded as tolerated. If the patient normally receives enteral feeds at home, see CPG Enteral feeding and medication administration for further guidelines. It is important to ensure that the child’s pain is adequately controlled before attempting movement. It can also be helpful for the child when the nurse and carers provide reassurance prior to, and during, the transfer. More than one handler may be required, depending on patient’s size and cooperation. Nappies need to be checked every 2 hours during the day and 3-4 hourly overnight. Newborn nappies or incontinence pads should be tucked into the front and back of the toileting area and covered with a larger disposable nappy. Children who are continent can use a bed pan and/or urinal bottle. When using a bedpan, elevate the child’s head and shoulders with pillows and/or bed mechanics. The pad is removed with the bedpan. Patients post open reduction may have 2 small groin dressings which are to remain intact until follow up. The first modern baby hatch was in South Africa in July 1999 and was installed by Door of Hope Children's Mission (Hole in the Wall) at a small mission church in Berea in Johannesburg. In 1999 the pastor, Cheryl Allen, and deacons learned with deep distress that a high number of newly born infants were abandoned. Pastor Allen realised that many of those desperate women and girls may well have acted differently if there had been an alternative. The church made a hole in their wall and a \"baby bin\" was installed allowing for mothers to leave their babies any time, day or night. The moment a baby is placed in the \"baby bin\" care workers on duty receive an electronic signal alerting them. The baby is taken in and the anonymity of the \"donor\" ensured. Baby M was the first baby that came through the \"baby bin\", arriving \n\n in France, women are allowed to give birth anonymously in hospitals (accouchement sous X) and leave their baby there. In Brazil and Portugal, foundling wheels (roda dos expostos/enjeitados, literally \"wheel for exposed/rejected ones\") were also used after Queen Maria I proclaimed on May 24, 1783, that all towns should have a foundling hospital. One example was the wheel installed at the Santa Casa de Misericordia hospital in São Paulo on July 2, 1825. This was taken out of use on June 5, 1949, declared incompatible with the modern social system after five years' debate.

Another foundling wheel dating to at least 1601 is on display for visitors to Naples' Church of the Annunciata. In Hamburg, Germany, a Dutch merchant set up a wheel (Drehladen) in an orphanage in 1709. It closed after only five years in 1714 as the number of babies left there was too high for the orphanage to cope with financially. In France, foundling wheels (tours d'abandon, abandonment wheel) were introduced by Saint Vincent de Paul who built the first foundling home in 1638 in Paris.

However, the pressure for change generated by the strikes in turn led to the August strikes in Gdańsk and elsewhere on Poland's Baltic Sea Coast, which shortly after led to the emergence of the Solidarity movement. The organisation grew from this protest, and demanded Objective One regional funding for Cornwall, an exclusively-Cornish European Parliament constituency, a Cornish university, support for Cornwall's traditional industries and local control over Cornwall's health service; these demands were broadly similar to those being made at the time by Mebyon Kernow, a Cornish nationalist party that had recently relaunched itself.

Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" However, he praised Ford's performance.

One of the most acclaimed actors of his generation, he is the recipient of numerous accolades, including a Screen Actors Guild Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and an Academy Award from seven nominations. Critic Pauline Kael wrote that Bridges \"may be the most natural and least self-conscious screen actor that has ever lived.\" Bridges comes from a prominent acting family and appeared on the television series Sea Hunt (1958–1960) alongside his father, Lloyd Bridges, and brother, Beau Bridges. His Oscar-nominated roles include The Last Picture Show (1971), Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974), Starman (1984), The Contender (2000), True Grit (2010), and Hell or High Water (2016). For his performance as an alcoholic singer in the 2009 film Crazy Heart, he received the Academy Award for Best Actor. Bridges has also starred in other critically acclaimed roles such as The Fabulous Baker Boys (1989), The Fisher King (1991), The Big Lebowski (1998) and Bad Times at the El Royale (2018), along with the commercially successful films King Kong (1976), Tron (1982), Iron Man (2008), and Tron: Legacy (2010). Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Ford began his acting career on the stage. He went on to appear in productions of William C. deMille's Strongheart; Glorious Betsy by Rida Johnson Young (the production lasted only 24 performances but the play was later adapted for an Oscar-nominated film of the same name); Bayard Veiller's The Fight (which quickly closed); Edgar Wallace's The Switchboard; Edward Locke's The Bubble; and Edgar Selwyn's Rolling Stones. Ford turned to film beginning in 1915 and moved to Hollywood. He became a leading man opposite stars such as Constance Talmadge, Norma Talmadge, Marie Prevost, Marion Davies, Marguerite De La Motte and Clara Bow. Ford's film career ended with the advent of talkies. His final film, and only talkie, Love in High Gear, was released in 1932. During World War II, he toured with the United Service Organizations (USO). Regarding Henry is a 1991 American drama film directed by Mike Nichols and written by J.J. Abrams.

Vincent Canby of The New York Times described the film as \"a sentimental urban fairy tale\" that \"succeeds neither as an all-out inspirational drama nor as a send-up of American manners.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film two out of four stars and commented, \"There is possibly a good movie to be found somewhere within this story, but Mike Nichols has not found it in Regarding Henry. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post called the film \"a tidy parable of '90s sanctimony\" while Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described it as a \"slick tearjerker\" that \"has a knack for trivializing the big issues it strenuously raises.\" However, he praised Ford's performance. Variety, however, called the film \"a subtle emotional journey impeccably orchestrated by director Mike Nichols and acutely well acted.\" The site's critics consensus reads, \"Although Harrison Ford makes the most of an opportunity to dig into a serious role, Regarding Henry is undermined by cheap sentiment and clichés.\" The film was nominated in 2006 by the American Film Institute for their 100 Years...100 Cheers list, but was not selected. Accolades  \n\nAnnette Bening was named Newcomer of the Year for her work in this as well as Guilty by Suspicion, The Grifters, Valmont, and Postcards from the Edge by the London Film Critics' Circle.

McGwire, who hit a major league-leading 52 homers for the Oakland Athletics last season, becomes the first player with back-to-back 50-homer seasons since Ruth did it in 1927 and 1928. ; September 28 – Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres ties Honus Wagner's record by winning his eighth National League batting title. McGwire's record of 70 would last a mere three years following the meteoric rise of veteran San Francisco Giants left fielder Barry Bonds in 2001. In 2001 Bonds knocked out 73 home runs, breaking the record set by McGwire by hitting his 71st on October 5, 2001. In addition to the home run record, Bonds also set single-season marks for base on balls with 177 (breaking the previous record of 170, set by Babe Ruth in 1923) and slugging percentage with .863 (breaking the mark of .847 set by \n\n Bonds and Ken Griffey Jr. From 1994 to 2000, a span including his age-26 through age-32 seasons, he averaged 41 home runs and 41 doubles per 162 games while batting .309, .433 OBP, and .593 SLG for a 167 OPS+. He is the only player in history to achieve six consecutive seasons (1996–2001) with each of 30 home runs, 100 RBI, 100 \n\n scored, and 100 walks. He is just one of 21 players \n\n  In 1998, the teams were connected by the Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa home run race, credited by many with revitalizing the sport following the players' strike which cancelled the 1994 World Series and the first part of the 1995 season. The following day, McGwire broke the record with #62 off Steve Trachsel in the fourth inning as part of a 6–3 victory. In a show of sportsmanship, Sammy Sosa embraced and congratulated his rival and on-field opponent after McGwire rounded the bases. McGwire would finish the year with 70 home runs and Sosa with 66.\n\nQuestion: Who's home runs record did Mark McGwire break in the 1998 season?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

His first show was Andrew MacDonald's Circus, but in 1897 he joined the Ringling Bros. Before the turn of the century Oakley performed with the Barnum & Bailey Circus, followed by three seasons with the Adam Forepaugh & \n\nA&P's first supermarket opened in Braddock in 1936. ; George A. Romero's 1978 horror film Martin takes place in Braddock and was largely filmed there. ; Episode 1 of the TV series Mindhunter is set in Braddock. Schlitzie (alternatively spelled Schlitze or Shlitze; September 10, 1901 – September 24, 1971), possibly born Simon Metz and legally Schlitze Surtees, was an American sideshow performer. His lifelong career on the outdoor entertainment circuit as a major sideshow attraction with Barnum & Bailey, among others, made him a popular cultural icon. Information about Schlitzie's identity at birth may never be known, the information having been lost as he was handed off to various carnivals in a long line of mostly informal guardianships throughout his career. Career\nOn the sideshow circuit, microcephalic people were usually promoted as \"pinheads\" or \"missing links\", and Schlitzie was billed under such titles as \"The Last of the Aztecs\", \"The Monkey Girl\", and . The sideshow circuit was a tremendous success for Schlitzie; throughout the 1920s and 1930s he was employed by many upscale circuses, including Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty Circus, Tom Mix Circus, Crafts 20 Big Shows, and Foley & Burke Carnival. In 1928, Schlitzie made his film debut in The Sideshow, a drama set in a circus, which featured a variety of actual sideshow performers. Freaks and later work\nSchlitzie landed his best-known role as an actor in Tod Browning's 1932 horror film Freaks. Schlitzie has a scene of (unintelligible) dialogue with actor Wallace Ford. In 1941, Schlitzie appeared in his final film role as \"Princess Bibi\", a sideshow attraction, in Meet Boston Blackie. Hospitalization\nUnder George Surtees' care, Schlitzie continued performing the sideshow circuit; after Surtees' death in 1965, his daughter, who was not in show business, committed Schlitzie to a Los Angeles county hospital. Hospital authorities determined that the best care for Schlitzie would be to make him a ward of Unks' employer, showman Sam Alexander, and return him to the sideshow, where he remained until 1968. Final years\nIn his later years, Schlitzie lived in Los Angeles, occasionally performing on various sideshow circuits both locally and internationally (he frequently performed in Hawaii and London, and his last major appearance was at the 1968 Dobritch International Circus held at the Los Angeles Sports Arena). Schlitzie also became a notable attraction performing on the streets of Hollywood, with his caretakers selling his stock carnival souvenir pictures. Schlitzie spent time in his final days on Santa Monica Boulevard. Death\nOn September 24, 1971, at seventy years old, Schlitzie died at Fountain View Convalescent Home. His death certificate listed his official name as \"Shlitze Surtees\" and his birthdate as 1901. Schlitzie was interred at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Rowland Heights. The film became the public's major exposure to Schlitzie, who remains one of the more memorable characters in the film. Griffith has recently released Nobody's Fool, a graphic novel biography of Schlitzie.

The Addamses are puzzled by the horrified reactions to their own good-natured and (to them) normal behavior. Along with their daughter Wednesday, their son Pugsley, Uncle Fester, and Grandmama, they reside at 0001 Cemetery Lane in an ornate, gloomy, Second Empire style mansion. Astin, Jones, Coogan, and Cassidy all reprised their roles; 11-year-old Jodie Foster provided the voice of Pugsley. Astin reprised his role as Gomez Addams for the 1992 animated adaptation of the series. In 1998, a standalone film, Addams Family Reunion, aired on the Fox Family Channel, followed by the series The New Addams Family that ran from 1998 to 2000. Astin appeared in the series as Grandpapa Addams.

The following day, police found Gypsy Rose in Wisconsin, where she had traveled with her boyfriend, Nicholas Godejohn, whom she had met online. When investigators announced that she was actually an adult, and was not suffering from any of the physical and mental health issues which her mother claimed she had, public outrage over the possible abduction of a severely disabled girl gave way to shock and some sympathy for Gypsy Rose.

Despite this, EUPD or BPD is the same thing. EUPD/BPD makes sense. My psychiatrist has referred me to an organisation based in Cornwall that helps those with mental health issues. In that article, I wrote about how Saltash Town Council had been debating about the future of the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how it was my belief that the argument was in the wrong, as it was about whether a male mayor’s consort could wear the “Mayoress’ Chain” and how this was a breach of the Equality Act 2010. However, it was come to my attention that the controversial issue has been reopened but without a debate being granted. Policeman/police woman, landlord/landlady, actor/actress; there are, of course, many other gender specific terms that we could discuss. With the changes in language, we now refer to those working in the police as police officers. Those who own land are, in the majority, still referred to with the gender specific terms, but there has been a growing change to calling them ‘land owners’ instead. As for those who act, their profession is now known as ‘actor’ no matter the gender. We change these terms because that is the right thing to do. Further to the argument surrounding gender specific terms, and how society should be proud of liberal values of equality, we come to the current issue that is being stirred back up with Saltash Town Council: the “Mayoress’ Chain”. I have been notified, by unnamed sources close to the council, that the Mayor of Saltash, Cllr John Brady, has sent an email to all councillors to inform them that he is reopening the debate that the council had less than a year ago. The debate, however, will not be a debate. Instead, the controversial mayor has declared that there will be no debate, but only a vote. However, the vote will not be carried out during a meeting, but over an online poll and for this result to be read out during the next council meeting. If you’re wondering, like I am, for the reasons behind this bizarre decision, keep reading as I will analyse the mayor’s actions later in this article. For now, I would like to keep discussing what should be the main issue here: the term “mayoress”. In 2017, Cllr John Brady was one of the main instigators behind the debate about the “Mayoress’ Chain” and the use of it by male mayor’s consorts over the last few years, when the mayor had been female (Cllr Jean Dent and, former Cllr, Hilary Frank). The argument was that the chain should not be used by male consorts as it had been originally, and historically, gifted to the town for the use of the mayoress. If a mayor’s consort is forbidden the use of the chain because of their gender, it is a form of direct discrimination. It would have been my suggestion to change the outdated title of the chain to “The Mayoral Consort’s Chain” or simply “The Consort’s Chain”. However, the council decided to retire the chain. The term\n\n Brown served as Mayor of Mesa for two consecutive, two-year terms from 1996 to 2000. He was a supporter of historic preservation and the conservation of the Sonoran Desert from urban sprawl. He also persuaded former Mayor Wayne Pomeroy to return to city council to fill the vacancy of a departing councilman. During his tenure as mayor, Brown championed the movement to construct the Mesa Arts Center in downtown Mesa. Under Brown, the city passed a quality-of-life bond issue, which was approved by voters in 1998, to pay for the center. Though he left office in 2000, Brown and his wife, Kathye, continued a private fundraising campaign for the arts center. The couple initially hoped to raise $3.5 million, but ultimately raised more than \n\n The mayor is elected in citywide election. Elections follow a two-round system. The first round of the election is called the primary election. The top-two candidates from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference. If the office of the mayor becomes vacant with one year or less remaining in the term, the city council appoints a person to fill the vacancy. If the vacancy occurs with more than one year remaining, the city council is obligated to call a special election.

The New York Times reported that Jagland shrugged off the question of whether \"the committee feared being labeled naïve for accepting a young politician's promises at face value\", stating that \"no one could deny that 'the international climate' had suddenly improved, and that Mr. Obama was the main reason... We want to embrace the message that he stands for.\" The first visits by an incumbent president to countries in Western Europe were made in 1918 and 19 by Woodrow Wilson in the aftermath of World War I. He was awarded the 1919 Nobel Peace Prize for his peacemaking efforts. No president has yet visited Liechtenstein, Luxembourg or Monaco. The 2009 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to United States President Barack Obama for his \"extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee announced the award on October 9, 2009, citing Obama's promotion of nuclear nonproliferation and a \"new climate\" in international relations fostered by Obama, especially in reaching out to the Muslim world. Obama accepted the prize in Oslo on December 10, 2009. In a 36-minute speech, he discussed the tensions between war and peace and the idea of a \"just war\" saying, \"perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars.\" Obama is the fourth President of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, with Carter's honor happening after leaving office).

Although Sampras was ranked higher, Agassi came out winning in straight sets. They met again on a Grand Slam level at the quarterfinals of Wimbledon in 1993, where Agassi was the defending champion and Sampras was the newly minted world No. With both Sampras and Agassi participating, the US won the Davis Cup in 1995. In the following 3 years, while Sampras continued winning Grand Slam titles every season, Agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions. For both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as Sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while Agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the French Open. Sampras forfeited the No. In the 2000s, they met three more times on the Grand Slam level offering three memorable contests. In arguably their most memorable match ever, Sampras defeated Agassi in the 2001 US Open quarterfinals in four sets. Reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during US Open rain delays, \n\n The rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 90's, as Sampras and Agassi were the most successful players of that decade. They also had very contrasting playing styles, with Sampras being considered the greatest server and Agassi the greatest serve returner at the time. Agassi and Sampras met 34 times on the tour level with Agassi trailing 14–20.\n\nQuestion: Which grand slam did Pete Sampras not win in the 20th century?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She also broke the 5000 metres race walk world record at Bislett Stadium in 1978. Gylder gained her first international experiences at regional level. The existing world record for two handed javelin throw by Eric Lemming was 91.28 metres, but with their enhancement, Jarl broke it with 91.41 metres. It was then improved by Evert to 98.47, followed by Lemming imitating their grip and taking back the record with 104.40 metres. He entered four events in the Olympic Games:\n\n Jorun Askersrud, later Nygaard, also married Tangen (6 May 1929 &ndash; 12 October 2012) was a Norwegian cross-country skier and track and field athlete during the 1950s. In 1952 she finished 12th in the 10 km cross-country event at the Winter Olympics in Oslo and competed without reaching the final in 100 metres and 80 metres hurdles at the Summer Olympics. Her personal best times in her athletic Olympic events were 12.2 seconds and 11.8 seconds, respectively. She won her first Olympic medals in 1998, and won her first gold medal in the 2002 Winter Olympics, coming from behind to beat the favourites Olga Danilova and Julija Tchepalova in the last kilometers of the 10 km classical event. She also won a bronze medal in 30 km classical as well as a silver medal in the relay. Additionally, she won five gold medals (5 km: 1999, 10 km: 2001, 2003, and 15 km: 2001, 2003) from the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships, as well as two silver (4 × 5 km relay: 1997, 2001) medals.

The race was won by Mike Hawthorn driving a Ferrari 246 F1; it was his first Formula One victory since the 1954 Spanish Grand Prix and would prove to be his last. It was also the last Formula One race for five-time World Champion Juan Manuel Fangio. On the final lap, Hawthorn eased up to let Fangio, running fifth at the time, finish on the lead lap of his last race. It was race 1 of 11 in the 1958 World Championship of Drivers and race 1 of 10 in the 1958 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers. The race was held over 80 laps of the four kilometre circuit for a total race distance of 313 kilometres. The race was won by British driver Stirling Moss in Rob Walker's privately entered Cooper T43. Moss took his seventh Grand Prix victory by 2.7 seconds over Italian driver Luigi Musso (Ferrari 246 F1). Musso's British teammate Mike Hawthorn (Ferrari 246 F1) was third. Initially Mike Hawthorn was assigned to drive the Ferrari 412 MI #12 for the 1958 edition of the Race of Two Worlds. But when he felt unwell, his teammate Luigi Musso had to run the race. Hawthorn and Phil Hill drove the car later, as relief drivers. Eugenio Castellotti / Giulio Musitelli duo won the race. Cornacchia later won the Trieste-Opicina hillclimb.

In contrast, spam email messages are generally accepted to be unsolicited. Though they may be sale notices, coupons, social updates and the like, graymail messages are sent by reputable sources who value their relationship with the recipient. However, as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication, in the 1990s, users increasingly began referring to it as \"spam\", and began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It involves using email to send advertisements, request business, or solicit sales or donations. The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant's relationship with current or previous customers, encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and sharing third-party ads. Mobile phone spam is a form of spam (unsolicited messages, especially advertising), directed at the text messaging or other communications services of mobile phones or smartphones. This can be particularly annoying for the recipient because, unlike in email, some recipients may be charged a fee for every message received, including spam. Mobile phone spam is generally less pervasive than email spam, where in 2010 around 90% of email is spam. The amount of mobile spam varies widely from region to region. In North America, mobile spam steadily increased after\n\nQuestion: On the Internet what is Spam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

AARNet introduced its 'value added reseller' program to allow Internet service providers (ISPs) to use its network, the first being Connect.com.au in \n\n This protocol, agreed by the group in 1975, titled \"Proposal for an international end to end protocol\", was written by Vint Cerf, Alex McKenzie, Roger Scantlebury, and Hubert Zimmermann. Although the protocol was adopted by networks in Europe, it was not adopted by the CCIT or by the ARPANET. Later international work led to the OSI model in 1984, \n\n SATNET in 1982 and on the ARPANET in January 1983 after the DoD made it standard for all military computer networking. Computer manufacturers developed proprietary protocol suites such as IBM's Systems Network Architecture (SNA), Digital Equipment Corporation's DECnet, and Xerox's Xerox Network Systems (XNS). During the late 1970s and most of the 1980s, there remained a lack of open networking options. Therefore, proprietary standards, particularly SNA and DECnet, as well as some \n\nAt 10:30 in the evening at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) campus, the first message was sent over ARPANET, the forerunner of the internet. Leonard Kleinrock would recall later that the first message, transmitted from UCLA to the computer at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) was intended to be transmitting the letters \"L-O-G\", after which Stanford would add two more letters to send back the word \"LOGIN\". Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine in December as a monolithic (single layer) design. The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London, but it was not installed\n\nQuestion: In which country did the Internet start?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

First published in December 1989 in Vanity Fair, the book grew out of a lecture that Styron originally delivered at a symposium on affective disorders at the Department of Psychiatry of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Through the employment of anecdotes, speculation, and reportage, Styron reflects on the causes and effects of depression, drawing links between his own illness and that of other writers and public figures. Plot In October 1985, American author William Styron travels to Paris to receive the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca, a prestigious literary award. One night, after a particularly intense bout of suicide ideation that culminates in him actively preparing to take his own life, Styron hears a passage from Brahms' Alto Rhapsody, to which he has a fiercely emotional response. Main figures William Styron is a renowned American author who, at sixty years of age, is afflicted by clinical depression. Throughout the memoir, Dr. Gold maintains a cold and distant demeanor and mostly resorts to repeating information from The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Throughout the memoir, Styron discusses the effects of depression on the lives of several notable people, who range from accomplished authors such as Romain Gary (a close friend of Styron's), Randall Jarrell, Albert Camus, and Primo Levi (also a chemist and Holocaust survivor) to prominent political figures such as U.S. President Abraham Lincoln and activist Abbie Hoffman. Styron also mentions Jean Seberg, an American actress who experienced severe depression herself and who was also Romain Gary's second wife. Background and publication history Upon learning of the significant amount of criticism and ignorance directed towards the suicide of Primo Levi, Styron wrote an op-ed for The New York Times in December 1988, maintaining that Levi ended his life not because of a lack of morality, but because of a real, dangerous illness that threatened the health and lives of many people. The op-ed garnered positive reception and compelled many readers to openly speak about their experiences with depression, ultimately inspiring Styron to begin documenting his own ordeal. In May 1989, William Styron delivered a lecture about his experience with depression at a symposium for affective disorders at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. Several months later, he adapted the lecture into an essay and published it in the December 1989 issue of Vanity Fair. The following year, Random House published Styron's essay as a full-length memoir titled Darkness Visible, which included additional material that had been excluded from the original work due to limited space in Vanity Fair. For instance, Styron's account of his fateful trip to Paris in October 1985 was not included in the essay, but it was incorporated into Darkness Visible. The title of the memoir originates from John Milton's description of Hell in Paradise Lost: No light; but rather darkness visible Served only to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all, but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. Kaplan also noted that although \"Styron does much to dignify depression...[and] bring it out of the realm of unmentionable shame,\" he \"failed to see...how the disease had been central to his whole existence.\" People described the memoir as \"either woefully incomplete or, at almost 100 pages, more than you would want to know about Styron's history of melancholia.\" According to Peter Fulham of The Atlantic, Styron was effectively able to portray depression, which was typically difficult to describe, and its devastating impacts on not only his own life,\n\n anger at times.

To mitigate the effects of jet lag when traveling east, there are several strategies that individuals can employ. By implementing these strategies, individuals can mitigate the effects of jet lag and adjust more easily to the new time zone when traveling east. Parts of Australia, New Zealand and Fiji are areas of Oceania that currently observe daylight saving time (DST). San Francisco is at 122.41°W longitude and Richmond, Virginia is at 77.46°W longitude. They are both at about 37.6°N latitude (±.2°). The approximately 45° of longitude difference translates into about 180 minutes, or 3 hours, of time between sunsets in the two cities, for example. San Francisco is in the Pacific Time zone, and Richmond is in the Eastern Time zone, which are three hours apart, so the local clocks in each city show that the Sun sets at about the same time when using the local time zone. But a phone call from Richmond to San Francisco at sunset will reveal that there are still three hours of daylight left in California. In the United Kingdom, railroads gradually switched to Greenwich Mean Time (set from local time at the Greenwich observatory in London), followed by public clocks across the country generally, forming a single time zone. In the United States, railroads published schedules based on local time, then later based on standard time for that railroad (typically the local time at the railroad's headquarters), and then finally based on four standard time zones shared across all railroads, where neighboring zones differed by exactly one hour. At first railroad time was synchronized by \n\n first Sunday in September, 02:00 hours.

It is located on the western edge of the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau, about 40 mi south of downtown Cleveland. The Greater Akron area, covering Summit and Portage counties, had an estimated population of 703,505. The city was founded in 1825 by Simon Perkins and Paul Williams, along the Little Cuyahoga River at the summit of the developing Ohio and Erie Canal. The state's major professional sporting teams include: Cincinnati Reds (Major League Baseball), Cleveland Guardians (Major League Baseball), Cincinnati Bengals (National Football League), Cleveland Browns (National Football League), Cleveland Cavaliers (National Basketball Association), Columbus Blue Jackets (National Hockey League), Columbus Crew (Major League Soccer), and FC Cincinnati (Major League Soccer). Ohio played a central role in the development of both Major League Baseball and the National Football League. The Pro Football Hall of Fame is located in Canton. Ohio teams have won seven World Series (five for Cincinnati Reds, two for Cleveland Guardians), nine NFL Championships (four for Cleveland Browns, two for Canton Bulldogs, one for Cleveland Rams, one for Akron Pros, one for Cleveland Bulldogs), one NBA Finals (Cleveland Cavaliers), four AAFC Championships (Cleveland Browns), and two MLS Cups (Columbus Crew). It is located approximately 60 mi south of Cleveland and 20 mi south of Akron in Northeast Ohio.

Without recourse to a port on the Red Sea Israel would have been unable to develop its diplomatic, cultural and trade ties \n\n  The Suez Canal, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the sea journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. Built by French interests, 56% of the stocks in the canal remained in their hands, while 44% of the stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and \n\n The Suez Canal was completed in 1869, linking the Levantine Sea to the Red Sea &ndash; and mainly for large vessels.

Each carrier vehicle only needs one specially marked \"Apportioned\", \"APP\", or \"PRP\" license plate, and a cab card which lists each jurisdiction the vehicle is valid to do business in and how much weight it is registered to carry. In order to combat registration plate fraud, from the 1920s several jurisdictions developed their own anti-fraud typefaces so that characters cannot be painted or modified to resemble other characters. When a person moves from one state to another, they are normally required to obtain new registration plates issued by the new place of residence. The most prominent exceptions \n\n  The country in which a motor vehicle's vehicle registration plate was issued may be indicated by an international licence plate country code, formerly known as an International Registration Letter or International Circulation Mark.

The allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as the Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN's Geneva Convention on Road Traffic and the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic.

He also increased the rank of their peerages from village marquis (亭侯) to district marquis (鄉侯). While exiled in Japan in 1914, Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party, but many of his old revolutionary comrades, including Huang Xing, Wang Jingwei, Hu Hanmin and Chen Jiongming, refused to join him or support his efforts in inciting armed uprising against Yuan Shikai.

He is one of the founding members of Fatah, the biggest faction of the PLO, and the first Palestinian ambassador to Iran, following the revolution. Following the collapse of the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations at Camp David in 2000, Hani Al Hassan remained with Arafat and following the death of Arafat, Al Hassan accused Israel of killing Yasser Arafat. He originally studied engineering in the late 1950-60s where he organized an Islamist slate, Shabab al Aqsa, to compete in student elections. West Germany (Darmstadt and Munich), where he worked through the General Union of Palestinian Students (GUPS) in Europe, and acted as Fatah’s main Europe link after he merged his own commando group to Fatah in 1963 until 1967. He is the younger brother of Khaled al-Hassan,He spent time as a refugee in Yarmouk camp, near Damascus,\n\n Although President Arafat had undertaken significant reform steps since May 2002, the process stalled from March 2003 due to both Israeli measures and internal political factors. Abbas was in a weak position, due to his failing to counter the Israelis, who refused to release prisoners and continued with the occupation of Palestinian cities, settlement activities, assassinations and incursions, and the maintenance of checkpoints. Ghneim became involved in Palestinian politics, becoming a founding member of Fatah in 1957. He also participated in the founding of the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. For much of this period, he fought against Israel alongside Yasser Arafat in Lebanon. Following the PLO's departure from Lebanon in the early 1980s, Ghneim moved to Tunisia with much of the Palestinian leadership. Ghneim \n\n By early 2003, as Israel and the United States refused to negotiate with Yasser Arafat, it was thought that Abbas would be a candidate for the kind of leadership role envisaged by both countries. As one of the few remaining founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court).

The film studios responded by refusing to hire Guild members and forming \n\n the form of a melodrama, mostly because he thought many of the films from the silent era that have aged best are of that genre.

Side One Side Two\n\n The Original Soundtrack to the film South Pacific was released in 1958. The film was based on the 1949 musical South Pacific by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Reviews of the production were mixed at best. It was first introduced by Mary Martin in the original Broadway production and sung by Mitzi Gaynor in the 1958 film adaptation. In the show, Nellie sings this song after being convinced that despite the racial differences between her and Emile, there is good in him. They introduced it to Mary Martin one night when they were at Joshua Logan's house fine-tuning the script. Hammerstein wrote this song to express the exuberance of Nellie's character at this point in the show, and it carried over to Mary Martin's performance of it. The script is based on Bell's 1918 play A Dislocated Honeymoon. It toured through several cities and ended in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where it closed on April 16, 1921.\n\nQuestion: South Pacific was set during which war?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas. It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe. Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically. Asia covers an area of 44,579,000 km2, about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Its 4.5 billion people constitute roughly 60% of the world's population. In general terms, Asia is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, \n\n the south by the Indian Ocean, and on the north by the Arctic Ocean. The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line. For example, Sir Barry Cunliffe, the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely \"the western excrescence of the continent of Asia\". Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf. Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface.

A treaty establishing the European Union was eventually agreed on 10 December 1991 and signed on 7 February of the following year. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) is one of two treaties forming the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU), the other being the Treaty on European Union (TEU; also referred to as the Treaty of Maastricht). The Treaty originated as the Treaty of Rome (fully the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community), which brought about the creation of the European Economic Community (EEC), the best-known of the European Communities (EC). It was signed on 25 March 1957 by Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany and \n\n In February 1992, European Union countries signed the Maastricht Treaty which outlined a three-stage plan to accelerate progress toward an Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Key to the Maastricht Treaty was the outlining of convergence criteria that EU members would need to satisfy before being permitted to proceed. Italian historian Federico Romero reports that observers at the time emphasized that,: Following the end of the Cold War, the European Economic Community pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries. In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty established the European Union, succeeding the EEC and furthering political co-operation. The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic \n\n The Single European Act was signed by the foreign ministers on 17 and 28 February 1986 in Luxembourg and The Hague respectively.

The area is best known for the production of champagne, the sparkling white wine that bears the region's name. EU law and the laws of most countries reserve the term \"champagne\" exclusively for wines that come from this region located about 160 kilometres (100 miles) east of Paris. The viticultural boundaries of Champagne are legally defined and split into five wine-producing districts within the historical province: Aube, Côte des Blancs, Côte de Sézanne, Montagne de Reims, and Vallée de la Marne. Reims is famous for its \n\n The quote attributed to Perignon – \"Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!\" – is supposedly what he said when tasting the first sparkling champagne. A major proponent of the misconceptions surrounding Dom Pérignon came from one of his successors at the Abbey of Hautvillers, Dom Groussard, who in 1821 gave an account of Dom Pérignon \"inventing\" Champagne among other exaggerated tales about the Abbey in order to garner historical importance and prestige for the church. Groussard's myth achieved more than prestige for the church, it helped commercialize champagne at the turn of the twentieth century. The Syndicat du Commerce used the myth to promote Champagne and the Champagne region, producing a pamphlet called Le Vin de Champagne in 1896 that celebrated Perignon as \n\n in France and abroad.

The first line opened without ceremony on 19 July 1900, during the World's Fair (Exposition Universelle). The network reached saturation after World War II with new trains to allow higher traffic, but further improvements have been limited by the design of the network and in particular the short distances between stations. Besides the Métro, central Paris and its urban area are served by five RER lines (developed from the 1960s), ten tramway lines (developed from the 1990s) \n\n Piraeus–Monastiraki–Iraklio–Lavrio–Kifissia The first railway line that operated in Greece was the one connecting Athens and its port Piraeus, which opened in 1869. It ran for a distance of 8 km from the port of Piraeus to Thissio in center of Athens. From 1911 it was also possible to run through freight trains on the Piraeus Harbour Tramway using dual system electric locomotives. Another company, Attica Railways in 1885, ran a metre-gauge suburban line from Lavrio Square to the north of Omonoia Square and to Iraklio (a northern suburb). Beovoz was the suburban/commuter railway network that provided mass-transit services in the city, similar to Paris's RER and Toronto's GO Transit. The main usage of system was to connect the suburbs with the city centre. Beovoz was operated by Serbian Railways.

In a CMT interview with Patty Loveless, Parton confirmed that the man on the album cover is her reclusive husband, Carl Dean. Riley, who was working as a secretary in Nashville for Jerry Chesnut, got to hear the song and recorded it herself and it became a massive hit for her. Riley's version won her a Grammy for the Best Country Vocal Performance, Female. The song later inspired an eponymous 1978 motion picture and short-lived 1981 television series, both starring Barbara Eden playing the heroine of the story, Mrs. Johnson, who now had a first name, Stella. The series went on to flesh out the story in the song, as it told of the adventures of Stella Johnson (Barbara Eden), a widowed single mother to teenager Dee (Jenn Thompson), who lived in the fictional town of Harper Valley, Ohio. The town was dominated by the namesakes of the founder, the Harper family, most prominently represented by the mayor, Otis Harper, Jr (George Gobel). Mrs. Johnson's flouting of the small town's conventions, and exposure of the hypocrisy of many of its other notorious residents provided the humour. Her most notable foes were the wealthy and completely snobbish Reilly family, which consisted of the snobby head of the family, Flora (Anne Francine); her snotty daughter, Wanda (Bridget Hanley); her husband, Bobby, (Rod McCary) and their daughter, \n\n In the title song, Parton looks back on her impoverished upbringing, concluding that while she values the lessons it taught her, she would not want to go back. Parton also covers the Jeannie C.

At his urging, Greenberg visited the UK six or seven times every year in search of acts to sign to the label. For much of its early history, Jerry Wexler had been managers of the label, while Ertegun had concentrated on A&R and had less interest in the business side. But that changed after the sale to Warner. He gained executive control of the label and influenced the Warner group. In seven years, Greenberg went from personal assistant to president of the label.

An interview with Collins about the making of the album was recorded in Geneva in August 1996 and released on a separate disc.

In later years, it became a contender for the title of \"first rock 'n' roll record\". It arguably coined the very name of this new type of music: rock and roll\". Sam Philips, the founder of Sun Records and Sun Studio, and many writers have suggested that \"Rocket 88\" has strong claims to be called the first rock'n'roll record.

It is primarily renowned for its extensive paintings collection, which covers all artistic evolutions. In the early 20th century the Museum of Grenoble became the first French museum to open its collections to modern art, and its collection of modern and contemporary art has grown to become one of the largest in Europe. The museum's collections are spread throughout several wings in the Fifth Avenue location in addition to The Cloisters museum and gardens in northern Manhattan. The museum guide has been designed to highlight the various major sections based on the importance of their holdings in the \"over-all hierarchy of the arts and public response\". Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. (The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, for example, was created by John Taylor Johnston, a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) The Museum has operated independently since 1979. It also boasts having one of the largest African American Folk Art collections in the U.S.. The Museum's operators say they strive to present a meaningful experience to children and adults who do not normally visit art museums. The museum houses a rich heritage of American art and history in four vaulted galleries that are augmented by a research library. At 135000 sqft, the Meier building has room to display only about three percent of the museum's permanent collection.\n\nQuestion: Which museum has the highest-funded art gallery?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He first became famous as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. Jackson said he had been physically abused by his father and had not had a childhood. As an adult Jackson's appearance began to change, as his nose became thinner and his skin lightened. Media reports and criticism stated that he wanted to look more white and had extensive cosmetic surgery that resulted in a public discussion about his mental health. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. To treat the condition, he used makeup to even out his skin. When the condition got worse Jackson used prescription creams to depigment his skin. Over years a lot of different rumors about Jackson's sexuality and the paternity of his children circulated. In 2005 he was acquitted on child sexual abuse. In 1993 he became gradually dependent on these drugs and went into rehabilitation. Jackson also suffered from dehydration and insomnia. The singer contradicted media reports saying he was trying to look more white. In 1993 Jackson revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was suffering from vitiligo. Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. Jackson was criticized for hiding it by bleaching, and some even cast doubt on whether he suffered from vitiligo. In late 1993 Jackson's skin disorder became relevant for the investigations into sexual child abuse accusations against him. A search warrant was served on Jackson allowing authorities to examine and photograph any part of the singer's body including his private parts. Shortly after Jackson's death, FDA-approved creams to treat vitiligo (Benoquin and hydroquinone) had been found in Jackson's residence. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid drawing attention to his skin. World Vitiligo Day is held on Jackson's passing day. Jackson contradicted those reports in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk saying he only had had two rhinoplasties. Jackson had told Patrick Treacy that he been suffering from a facial hypersensitivity caused by a botched cosmetic surgery. Jackson's second wife Debbie Rowe, who had met Jackson while she had been working for Klein, said she had been designated to help him through procedures. In 2017 British broadcaster Sky canceled the airing of an episode of Urban Myths which cast Joseph Fiennes to portray Jackson with heavy white makeup and a constructed nose. Jackson however, said that he had a dimple created in his chin attributing the other changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. He also denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. Jackson said he had a tough time when he reached puberty. People hadn't recognized expecting 'cute Michael' they used to know, and Jackson said they had seemed to be surprised that he was undergoing natural changes during puberty. In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson was asked about his cheeks; he answered: \"These cheekbones?

Jackson however, said that he had a dimple created in his chin attributing the other changes in the structure of his face to puberty, a strict vegetarian diet, weight loss, a change in hair style and stage lighting. He also denied allegations that he had altered his eyes. Jackson said he had a tough time when he reached puberty. People hadn't recognized expecting 'cute Michael' they used to know, and Jackson said they had seemed to be surprised that he was undergoing natural changes during puberty. In the unedited version of the documentary Living With Michael Jackson, Jackson was asked about his cheeks; he answered: \"These cheekbones?

In June 2003 Jackson had been briefly hospitalized before a deposition in a copyright matter. A lawyer for Jackson stated Jackson ‘sometimes became nervous and failed to eat when faced with depositions‘. He first became famous as a child star with the Jackson 5 and later as a solo artist. Jackson said he had been physically abused by his father and had not had a childhood. As an adult Jackson's appearance began to change, as his nose became thinner and his skin lightened. Media reports and criticism stated that he wanted to look more white and had extensive cosmetic surgery that resulted in a public discussion about his mental health. Jackson said he had not purposely bleached his skin and that he was not trying to be anything he was not. To treat the condition, he used makeup to even out his skin. When the condition got worse Jackson used prescription creams to depigment his skin. Over years a lot of different rumors about Jackson's sexuality and the paternity of his children circulated. In 2005 he was acquitted on child sexual abuse. In 1993 he became gradually dependent on these drugs and went into rehabilitation. Jackson also suffered from dehydration and insomnia. While preparing for a series of London comeback concerts scheduled to begin in July 2009, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication after suffering cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. The singer contradicted media reports saying he was trying to look more white. In 1993 Jackson revealed in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that he was suffering from vitiligo. Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62 million Americans. Jackson was criticized for hiding it by bleaching, and some even cast doubt on whether he suffered from vitiligo. In late 1993 Jackson's skin disorder became relevant for the investigations into sexual child abuse accusations against him. A search warrant was served on Jackson allowing authorities to examine and photograph any part of the singer's body including his private parts. Shortly after Jackson's death, FDA-approved creams to treat vitiligo (Benoquin and hydroquinone) had been found in Jackson's residence. Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid drawing attention to his skin.

Caesurae can occur in later forms of verse, where they are usually optional. The so-called ballad meter, or the common meter of the hymnodists (see also hymn), is usually thought of as a line of iambic tetrameter followed by a line of trimeter, but it can also be considered a line of heptameter with a fixed caesura at the fourth foot. It can, however, be used for rhetorical effect, as in Alexander Pope's line: \n\n showing man as both the one to be redeemed and the redeemer. The first formulation is Christian, the second alchemical. In the first case man attributes the need of redemption to himself and leaves the work of redemption, the actual opus, to the autonomous divine figure; in the latter case man takes upon himself the duty of carrying out the redeeming opus, and attributes the state of suffering and consequent need of redemption to the anima mundi imprisoned in matter.

Physicians writing marijuana certifications must have a valid Arizona license to practice medicine, must confirm the diagnosis of a qualifying condition, establish a medical record for the patient, conduct a in-person physical within the last 90 days, review the last year of medical records from the patient, explain the potential risks of using marijuana, attest in writing that the patient is likely to receive a benefit from using the drug and fill out a one-page form to be turned into ADHS. The department will only accept the ADHS form. In order to apply for a medical marijuana patient registry card, a patient must fill out an online application at www.azdhs.gov, see a doctor for diagnosis and turn in the ADHS's physician certification form. Visitors from other states can also possess and use medical marijuana if they have valid medical marijuana cards from their home state. People wanting to open a dispensary must be over the age of 21 and a resident of Arizona for more than three consecutive years prior to the date of the application. They must also submit information on whether they have been delinquent in paying taxes, child support or student loans, filed for bankruptcy and have access to $150,000 in startup costs. If more than one person applies for a dispensary certificate, the department will determine who gets the permit based on a evaluative process, that has not been defined. The cost to apply for a dispensary registration certificate is $5,000. The cost to renew a certificate is $1,000 and to change the location of a dispensary is $2,500. The department will notify a person if their dispensary application is not completely filled out. The dispensary certificates are non-transferable. In order to open a dispensary, a person must meet all local zoning requirements and apply for approval to operate the dispensary with ADHS at least 60 days before the expiration of their dispensary registration certificate. In order to prevent unauthorized use of the drug, dispensaries will have to keep track of inventory and patient information as well as implement security features, such as electronic monitoring, restricted access and intrusion procedures, all of which must be provided to ADHS. Medical directors are not allowed to issue medical marijuana certificates to patients. The vehicle used must not have anything on it identifying it with medical marijuana and no visible marijuana. A dispensary agent will have to file a trip plan, carry a copy of the plan and have a means of communicating with the dispensary. After completing the trip the agent must enter in the time it took to make the trip and any deviations from the plan. In order to register and license a livestock enterprise, there are several steps that need to be taken. Firstly, the owner must declare the type of keeping system and the animal species. This information is necessary for record-keeping and regulatory purposes. Secondly, the owner needs to apply for a registration number that is specific to the farm site. This registration number is typically listed in a geographical information system (GIS). It serves as a unique identifier for the enterprise and helps authorities track and monitor livestock operations. This process ensures that the enterprise complies with regulations related to animal transportation (Viehverkehrsordnung) and animal disease control (Binnenmarkt-Tierseuchenverordnung). Licensing involves meeting specific criteria and implementing measures to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of the animals. Now, let's discuss why this process is important for common market trade and the issuing of health certificates. For common market trade, it is crucial to have a well-regulated livestock enterprise. By registering and licensing the operation, authorities can ensure that the business meets the necessary standards and follows proper protocols. This helps maintain the quality and safety of livestock products being traded within the common market. Health certificates provide information about the facilities and operations, including the name, address, and registration or license number. These certificates serve as documentation that attests to the health and safety of the animals and their products. When importing animals, special regulations such as quarantine and laboratory tests may be required. Through the registration and licensing process, authorities can enforce these regulations and prevent the spread of infectious diseases. In summary, registering and licensing a livestock enterprise involves declaring the type of keeping system and animal species, obtaining a registration number, and complying with relevant regulations. This process is important for common market trade as it ensures the quality and safety of products. Additionally, it enables the issuing of health certificates that provide vital information about the enterprise and its compliance with regulations. EU registration plates were introduced in Finland in 2001. EU plates are automatically given to all vehicles unless the owner makes a separate request for old model plates. If desired, EU plates can be changed for old model ones at inspection sites. Registration plates used in Finland are made of aluminium with a reflective membrane coating. Numbers and letters are embossed and painted. The embossing height is 1–1.2 mm. The number sequence of the registration plate cannot start with a zero, nor can zero be the only number. The letter combination CD is reserved for diplomatic vehicles. Usually the next available ID is given as the plate number. Special registration plates with a selected ID are also available upon request. A special registration plate is a regular plate with a special ID. The ID is subject to certain restrictions and requires a separate application subject to a fee. The application fee for a special registration plate is EUR 900. A vehicle has one or two plates depending on the vehicle class. In certain cases, a vehicle can also be given an additional plate. 2.

The People Power Revolution erupted that drove Marcos out of power, and Corazon Aquino, the runner-up, assumed the presidency. This chain of events eventually led to the resignation of Marcos' Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, and Armed Forces Vice-Chief of Staff General Fidel Ramos. Enrile and Ramos then secluded themselves in the military and police headquarters of Camp Aguinaldo and Camp Crame, respectively, leading to the People Power Revolution from 22 to 25 February 1986, which toppled the Marcos regime. This discontent, the resulting resurgence of the opposition in the 1984 Philippine parliamentary election, and the discovery of documents exposing his financial accounts and false war records led Marcos to call the snap election of 1986. To avoid what could have been a military confrontation in Manila between pro- and anti-Marcos troops, Marcos was advised by US President Ronald Reagan through Senator Paul Laxalt to \"cut and cut cleanly.\" Marcos then fled with his family to Hawaii. He was succeeded as president by Aquino's widow, Corazon \"Cory\" \n\n From February 22–25, 1986, many demonstrations against Marcos took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. The event, known as the People Power Revolution, involved many famous figures such as Archbishop Jaime Sin, Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos and Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. Finally, on February 25, the Marcos family was transported by U.S. Air Force HH-3E rescue helicopters to Clark Air Base to Angeles City, Pampanga, about 83 kilometers north of Manila, before boarding US Air Force DC-9 Medivac and C-141B planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived\n\nQuestion: Which President of the Philippines was deposed in 1986?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

On learning that Michigan's rival, the University of Chicago, was sending a delegation of athletes to the games in Paris, Pattengill led a fundraising effort to send some of Michigan's best athletes to the games. The effort raised sufficient funds to send four Michigan athletes and trainer Keene Fitzpatrick to Paris. One of the highlights for Michigan athletics during the Pattengill's time as chairman of the Athletic Boards came at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, which have sometimes been referred to as the \"Michigan Olympics.\" The Michigan medal winners were Archie Hahn (gold medals in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters), Ralph Rose (gold medal in the shot put, silver medal in the discus, and bronze medal in the hammer throw), Charles Dvorak (gold medal in the pole vault), Fred Schule (gold medal in the 110-meter hurdles), and William Coe (silver medal in the shot put). The United States is the nation that has won the most medals in athletics at the Olympic Games, around 795, of which 332 are gold. Most of the top Americans were; like many events in 1904, it was largely a United States championship. The men's triathlon was an unusual event conducted during the 1904 Summer Olympics.

The United States had its worst showing at a Winter Olympics since the 1998 Nagano Games, ranking out of the top three in both the gold and total medal count with 9 and 23 medals respectively, and finished fourth in both rankings.

The government decided to stop evicting trespassers from the Black Hills and offered to buy the land from the Sioux. When they refused, the government decided instead to take the land and gave the Lakota until January 31, 1876, to return to reservations. The tribes did not return to the reservations by the deadline, and Lt. Colonel George Custer found the main encampment of the Lakota and their allies at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Custer and his men were separated from their main body of troops, and they were all killed by the far more numerous Indians led by Crazy Horse and inspired by Sitting Bull's earlier vision of victory. Tourism is enabled by Hill City's proximity to Mount Rushmore, Crazy Horse Memorial, Custer State Park, and the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The range is about 55 miles (88 km) long from north to south and up to 18 miles (29 km) wide. The Black Range lies almost entirely within the Gila National Forest. Named after Rapid Creek, where the settlement developed, it is in western South Dakota, on the Black Hills' eastern slope. Known as the \"Gateway to the Black Hills\" and the \"City of Presidents\" because of the life-size bronze president statues downtown, Rapid City is split by a low mountain ridge that divides the city's western and eastern parts. In the neighboring Black Hills are the tourist attractions of Mount Rushmore, the Crazy Horse Memorial, Custer State Park, Wind Cave National Park, Jewel Cave National Monument, and the museum at the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research, and to the city's east is Badlands National Park. The Black Hills of South Dakota is one of the few remaining exposed portions of the Trans-Hudson orogenic belt.

A few minutes later the flight attendant called for any available medical personnel. Her coloration and capillary refill could not be assessed as there was poor lighting in the cabin and the emergency flashlight had a slightly yellow-tint to the lens. The flight purser came to the pediatrician wanting to know if he should call for emergency personnel to meet the plane as they were near landing. After a routine landing, the patient was carried off the plane by paramedics and taken away by ambulance. Estimates of in-flight emergencies vary because there currently are no consistent standards for measuring them. 1/333-1900 flights per year). Luckily most in-flight emergencies are not serious and most do not require evaluation or treatment by ground personnel. Estimates of in-flight deaths in the United States are 21-72/year with most being elderly passengers and are attributed to cardiac or pulmonary problems. The most common medication used in-flight was diphenhydramine. The most common reasons for airline diversion were seizures and asthma. Airline diversions for pediatrics were not common but it was estimated that the diversions costs $1.25 million per year. In the United States all aircraft with 30 or more passengers must have an emergency medical kit. Many airlines also carry supplemental kits with additional medications and supplies. As most in-flight emergencies will be for adult patients, a pediatrician may not feel as comfortable volunteering to help. The airlines may voluntarily offer a gift such as an upgraded seat, travel voucher, wine etc. Many airlines also provide direct communication with ground-based medical personnel who can assist the flight crew and volunteer medical personnel with evaluation, treatment options, and use of the emergency medical kit. Although the airplane is pressurized, it is not pressurized to sea-level. Therefore people with pulmonary or respiratory problems may have them exacerbated in-flight particularly if the flight is long. For some patient’s, their oxygen dissociation curve lies unusually close to the steep part of the curve, and the decreased cabin pressure movesit along the steep aspect of the curve. Increasing the cabin pressure or descending to a lower altitude may improve both problems and therefore improve the patient’s condition. What are the contraindications for airline travel? At what age can a newborn travel in a plane? What instructions should a pediatrician provide to families with children with chronic medical conditions regarding airline travel?

The first live flight test of the Martin-Baker system took place on 24 July 1946, when fitter Bernard Lynch ejected from a Gloster Meteor Mk III jet. Lynch demonstrated the ejection seat at the Daily Express Air Pageant in 1948, ejecting from a Meteor. Martin-Baker ejector seats were fitted to prototype and production aircraft from the late 1940s, and the first emergency use of such a seat occurred in 1949 during testing of the jet-powered Armstrong \n\n Starflight, the first hypersonic transport, is being prepared for a media-covered inaugural flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, Australia, a planned two-hour flight.

Normally, superheroes use their powers to counter day-to-day crime while also combating threats against humanity by their criminal counterparts, supervillains. Long-running superheroes such as DC's Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman and Marvel's Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man have a \"rogues gallery\" of such enemies. One of these supervillains might be the superhero's archenemy. He is the father of Bruce Wayne (Batman), and husband of Martha Wayne as well as the paternal grandfather of Damian Wayne.

She showed great versatility, easily moving from covering hard news stories, including the kidnapping of Peggy Ann Bradnick at Shade Gap, Pennsylvania, in May 1966, to interviewing such notables and newsmakers as President Lyndon B.

It tells the story of thirteen-year-old Anna Fitzgerald, who sues her parents for medical emancipation when she is told to donate a kidney to her elder sister Kate, who is gradually dying from acute leukemia. Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. The surgery required for both Kate and Anna would be major; it is not guaranteed to work, as the stress of the operation may kill Kate anyway, and the loss of a kidney could have a serious impact on Anna's life. Since Anna is fond of hockey, Anna petitions for medical emancipation with the help of lawyer Campbell Alexander, so she will be able to make her own decisions regarding her medical treatment and the donation of her kidney. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. Meanwhile, Anna's older brother, Jesse, who has spent most of his life being ignored in favor of ill Kate or donor Anna, spends most of his time setting fire to abandoned buildings with homemade explosives and using illegal drugs. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. During the trial, it is revealed that Anna is acting under her sister's wishes: Kate is tired of living; she's prepared to die and doesn't want to force Anna to donate a kidney that will likely not be adequate to save her life, so she encouraged Anna to gain the independence that has always been denied to her. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. After gaining medical emancipation, Anna hints that she plans to donate her kidney to Kate, wanting her sister to live. However, as Campbell drives her home after the trial, their car is t-boned by a truck. An injured Campbell approves the procedure and Kate's life is saved. During this time, Jesse becomes a police officer and Kate becomes a ballet teacher. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Sara refuses to accept the idea that Kate is likely to die, and in doing so she neglects the needs of her two other children, whom she keeps seeing in relation to Kate. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. She also often advises Anna regarding medical emancipation. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Suzanne - Jesse, Kate and Anna's wealthy aunt, Brian's sister-in-law and Sara's older sister of 10 years. Their relationship is strained due to her overzealousness in keeping Kate alive. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet. Kate has some of her happiest times with him, as he's one of the only people with whom she's been able to fully relate.

It is the longest railway line in the world, with a length of over 9,289 km, from the capital Moscow, the largest city in Europe, to Vladivostok, which is next to the Sea of Japan. The Trans-Siberian Railway has directly connected Moscow with Vladivostok since 1916. Expansion of the railway system continues, with connecting rails going into Asia, namely Mongolia, China and North Korea. There are also plans to connect Tokyo, the capital of Japan, to the railway via bridges between the mainland and the islands of Sakhalin and Hokkaido.

In 1990, with the implementation of the new constitution, the name of the country was changed from República Popular de Moçambique to República de Moçambique, and the text on the emblem was changed accordingly. Mozambique's parliamentary opposition would specifically like to see removed the image of the Kalashnikov assault rifle, which symbolizes the nation's struggle for independence, according to press reports. The emblem of the African Union consists of a gold ribbon bearing small interlocking red rings, from which palm leaves shoot up around an outer gold circle and an inner green circle, within which is a gold representation of Africa. The red interlinked rings stand for African solidarity and the blood shed for the liberation of Africa; the palm leaves, for peace; the gold, for Africa's wealth and bright future; the green, for African hopes and aspirations.

European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans. The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. This, in addition to political instability that followed the implementation of significant reforms in 1841 by the central government, contributed to Aleppo's decline and the rise of Damascus as a serious economic and political competitor with Aleppo. Time magazine wrote: \"...the ongoing devastation inflicted on the country's stunning archaeological sites—bullet holes lodged in walls of its ancient Roman cities, the debris of Byzantine churches, early mosques and crusader fortresses—rob Syria of its best chance for a post-conflict economic boom based on tourism, which, until the conflict started 18 months ago, contributed 12% to the national income.\" Fighting with mortars and machine guns caused damage to the main gate \n\n Archaeological findings in Deir Ezzor indicate that the area has been inhabited since the ninth millennium BC.

This convocation was one of the events that transformed the general economic and political malaise of the country into the French Revolution. Louis XVI's attempts to control it resulted in the Tennis Court Oath (serment du jeu de paume), on 20 June, the declaration of the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and eventually to the storming of the Bastille on 14 July, which started the French Revolution. During the French Revolution the National Convention became the executive power of France, following the execution of King Louis XVI. With powerful members, such as Maximilien Robespierre and Georges Danton, the Jacobin Club, a French political party established in 1790, at the birth of the revolution, managed to secure control of the government and pursue the revolution to their own ends, culminating in a \"Reign of Terror\". In 1790 the government, the National Constituent Assembly, reorganised France into administrative departments in order to rebalance the uneven distribution of French wealth, which had been subject to feudalism under the monarchical Ancien Régime.\n\nQuestion: Who was king of France at the time of the French Revolution?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

For many Bulgarians, the Cyrillic alphabet has become an important component of their national identity, and great pride is taken in having introduced Cyrillic into the EU in 2007. Pomaks (Помаци; Πομάκοι; Pomaklar) are Bulgarian-speaking Muslims inhabiting Bulgaria, northeastern Greece and mainly northwestern Turkey. The c. 220,000 strong ethno-confessional minority in Bulgaria is known officially as Bulgarian Muslims. They speak various Bulgarian dialects and those spoken in Greece and Turkey are referred to there as the Pomak language. Different members of the group today declare a variety of ethnic identities: Bulgarian, Pomak,   ethnic Muslims, Turkish and other. Balkan dialects, also known as Balkan I, are spoken in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Iran, North Macedonia, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine. Bugurdži, Drindari and Kalajdži Romani are spoken in North Macedonia, Kosovo, Serbia and in northern and central Bulgaria. Elšík uses this classification and dialect examples (geographical information from Matras ):\n\n Bulgarians are the main ethnic group in Bulgaria, according to the census of the population in 2011 they are 6,000,000 people, or 86% of the country's population.

The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception of the Holy Virgin Mary is a neo-Gothic Catholic Church at Moscow's center, that serves as the cathedral of the Catholic Archdiocese of Moscow. Located in the Central Administrative Okrug, it is one of three Catholic churches in Moscow and the largest in Russia. The construction of the cathedral was approved in 1894 by the Ministry of Internal Affairs under Russian Empire. Three-aisled and built from red brick, the cathedral is based on a design by architect Tomasz Bohdanowicz-Dworzecki. The style was influenced by Westminster Abbey and Milan \n\n the Catholic Church. In the nave, under the windows, are fourteen reliefs depicting the Stations of the Cross. The five-bay main aisle extends for 65 m, each with lateral arms 13 m long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is 30 m high. The façade is based on the design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Typically for old-style church buildings, each side aisle is strengthened by five buttresses, the ten together symbolising the Ten Commandments.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the cathedral in Red Square, Moscow?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It shares land borders with Sweden to the west, Russia to the east, Norway to the north, and is defined by the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, and the Gulf of Finland of the Baltic Sea across Estonia to the south. Finland covers an area of 338455 km2, with a population of 5.5 million.

There are also approximately 45,000 followers of Pentecostal Christianity, and more than 12,000 Catholic Christians in Finland, along with Anglicans, and some various Independent Christian communities. Prior to its Christianisation, beginning in the 11th century, Finnish paganism was the country's primary religion. The Muslim population in Finland is 2.7% of the total, with about 150,000 adherents in 2016.

As part of this same campaign the armies of Saladin conquered, expelled, enslaved, or killed the remaining Christian communities of Galilee, Samaria, Judea, as well as the coastal towns of Ashkelon, Jaffa, Caesarea, and Acre. Following another Crusade by the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1227, the city was surrendered by Saladin's descendant al-Kamil, in accordance with a diplomatic treaty in 1228. It remained under Christian control, under the treaty's \n\n possessions. In 1177 Saladin was defeated by the crusaders at the Battle of Montgisard, despite his numerical superiority. He finally launched a full invasion of Jerusalem in 1187, and annihilated the crusader army at the Battle of Hattin in July. Acre fell to Saladin soon after, and Jerusalem itself was captured in October. These events shocked Europe, resulting in the Third Crusade in 1189, led by Richard I of England, Philip II of France and Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor, though the last drowned en route. King Baldwin II of Jerusalem allowed the forming order of the Templars to set up \n\n the events in the East and urging all Christians to take up arms and go to the aid of those in the Kingdom of Jerusalem, calling for a new crusade to the Holy Land––the Third Crusade––to be led by Frederick Barbarossa and Richard I of England.

Three days after the battle, on 28 September, a second invasion army led by William, Duke of Normandy, landed in Pevensey Bay, Sussex, on the south coast of England. Harold had to immediately turn his troops around and force-march them southwards to intercept the Norman army. Less than three weeks after Stamford Bridge, on 14 October 1066, the English army was decisively defeated and King Harold II fell in action at the Battle of Hastings, beginning the Norman conquest of England, a process facilitated by the heavy losses amongst the English military commanders. An important pitched battle that demonstrated the evolution of tactics and technology during the Middle Ages was the battle of Hastings fought on the 14 October 1066. This battle was fought between the Norman-French Army under William the Conqueror and the English army under Anglo-Saxon King Harold Godwinson. This pitched battle was fought as William engaged Godwinson who deployed his army of infantry in a small dense formation at the top of a steep slope. Across the front of Godwinson's battle line was a shield wall made from soldiers interlocking their shields holding spears and missile troops behind. Edward's successor, Harold Godwinson, was defeated by Duke William the Conqueror of Normandy at the Battle of Hastings, leading to William's accession to the English throne. Tostig, Harold's estranged brother, was the first to move; according to the medieval historian Orderic Vitalis, he travelled to Normandy to enlist the help of William, Duke of Normandy, later to \n\n had been killed at Stamford Bridge. The city leaders surrendered the kingdom to him, and he was crowned at Westminster Abbey, Edward the Confessor's new church, on Christmas Day 1066.

CCP general secretary Jiang Zemin succeeded Deng as \"paramount leader\" in the 1990s, and \n\n  Communist China had been tacitly supported by the Soviet Union since the 1920s, though the Soviet Union diplomatically recognised the Republic of China, Joseph Stalin supported cooperation between the Nationalists and the Communists—including pressuring the Nationalist Government to grant the Communists state and military positions in the government. Initially Mao Zedong accepted the demands of the Soviet Union and in 1938 had recognized Chiang Kai-shek as the \"leader\" of the \"Chinese people\". In turn, the Soviet Union accepted Mao's tactic of \"continuous guerilla warfare\" in the countryside that involved a goal of extending the Communist bases, even if it would result in increased tensions with \n\n unification campaign led by Sun Yat-sen's successor, Chiang Kai-shek. The Party, still led by urban intellectuals, developed a radical agenda of mass mobilization, labor organization, rural uprisings, anti-imperialism, and national unification. As the Northern Expedition neared success, Chiang in December 1927 unleashed a White Terror that virtually wiped out the Party in the cities. Mao Zedong, whose Autumn Harvest Uprising had been a spectacular failure in mobilizing local peasants, never-the-less became Party leader and established rural bases and creation of the Chinese Red Army to protect them. During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) Mao led a rectification campaign to emphasize Maoism and his leadership and after the war he led the Party to victory in the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949). On May 31, 1924, the two governments signed an agreement to establish diplomatic relations, while the Soviet government renounced in that agreement all privileges granted to the Tsarist government in China. But in 1926 KMT leader Chiang Kai-shek abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers and imposed restrictions on CCP participation in the government. By 1927, after the conclusion of the Northern Expedition, Chiang purged the CCP from the KMT-CCP alliance, resulting in the Chinese Civil War which would last until 1949, a few months after the proclamation of the People's Republic of China, led by Mao Zedong. The largest of these was led by Zhu De and Mao Zedong, who established Soviet Republic of China in some remote areas within China through peasant riots.\n\nQuestion: Who proclaimed the People's Republic of China in 1949?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Henry VIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, had first been married to Henry's elder brother Arthur when he was a little over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died just a few months later. Henry later used this to justify the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.

It underwent a renovation in the 17th century, when the Habsburg Monarchy took over the Czech lands after the Thirty Years' War and remodeled it in \n\n Throughout the first half of its history the Holy Roman Empire was reigned by a travelling court. Kings and emperors toured between the numerous Kaiserpfalzes (Imperial palaces), usually resided for several weeks or months and furnished local legal matters, law and administration. Most rulers maintained one or a number of favourites Imperial palace sites, where they would advance development and spent most of their time: Charlemagne (Aachen from 794), Frederick II (Palermo 1220–1254), Wittelsbacher (Munich 1328–1347 and 1744–1745), Habsburger (Prague 1355–1437 and 1576–1611; and Vienna 1438–1576, 1611–1740 and 1745–1806). During the 13th century, an imperial castle owned by the Hohenstaufen was mentioned. After the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the castle first passed into the possession of the Counts of Veringen, subsequently falling to the house of Habsburg. In 1387, the mountain was mortgaged to the Truchsess of Waldburg. In 1786, the Waldburg dynasty sold the Lordship Bussen to Karl Anselm, 4th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Following the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss, the mediatisation and secularisation of numerous secular and ecclesiastical principalities within the former Holy Roman Empire, the Lordship was annexed by the newly formed Kingdom of Württemberg in 1806. The castle was built around 1020 by Count Radbot, of the nearby county of Klettgau in the Duchy of Swabia, and Werner, Bishop of Strasbourg. They had the castle erected 35 km southwest of Klettgau, on the Aar, the largest tributary of the High Rhine. The name of \"Habsburg\" was not added to the noble title until Radbot's grandson, Otto II. He added \"von Habsburg\" to his title, thus beginning the House of Habsburg. Habsburg Castle's importance diminished after Radbot's seventh generation descendant Rudolph moved the family's power base to Austria in 1276.\n\nQuestion: In which country is the castle that gives the Habsburg dynasty its name?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In August 1805, the 200,000-strong French Grande Armée invaded the German states, hoping to defeat Austria before Russian forces could intervene. The French emperor Napoleon successfully wheeled his army into the Austrian rear and defeated them at the Battle of Ulm, fought from 15 to 20 October. The Austrian capital, Vienna, was captured in November and a Russo-Austrian army was decisively defeated at the 2 December Battle of Austerlitz. If the two Austrian columns linked up and if Wurmser's troops were released, French prospects were grim. Davidovich scored a victory against Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois at Calliano and threatened Verona from the north. Leaving Vaubois' battered division to contain Davidovich, Bonaparte massed every available man and tried to turn Alvinczi's left flank \n\n Having been beaten the previous day by Steinmetz at Nachod, the Austrians had regrouped at the Aupa heights near Skalice, a town with only one bridge over the river Aupa. When he received intelligence that the Russians intended to attack him, the emperor thought the enemy move \"ridiculous\" since they had done little to trouble him while Danzig was under siege. Napoleon had 190,000 men under his direct command while Marshal André Masséna commanded the rest. The battle saw a bold maneuver by Napoleon Bonaparte's French Army of Italy to outflank the Austrian army led by József Alvinczi and cut off its line of retreat. Alvinczi planned to execute a two-pronged offensive against Bonaparte's army.\n\nQuestion: Who were the victors of the Battle of Austerlitz?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

There is no need for a quorum to be present at all times: commons debates could theoretically continue even if only one MP and the Speaker were present. However, if a division is called and fewer than 40 MPs are present, then a decision on the business being considered is postponed and the House moves on to consider the next item of business. The quorum for votes on legislation in the House of Lords is 30, but just three of the 753 peers, including the Lord Speaker, are required to be present for a debate to take place. Representatives are directly elected in single-member constituencies using the simple-majority (or first-past-the-post) system for a term of five years. The Representatives in turn decide whether the Senators are to be elected by their vote, or appointed. Parliament has two chambers. The House of Representatives has 19 members, 17 members elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies, 2 ex-officio member (President and Speaker). Elections must be held at least every five years but may be called by the prime minister at any time. The Parliament of the United Kingdom currently has 650 parliamentary constituencies across the constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), each electing a single member of parliament (MP) to the House of Commons by the plurality (first past the post) voting system, ordinarily every five years. Voting last took place in all 650 of those constituencies at the United Kingdom general election on 12 December 2019. The number of seats rose from 646 to 650 at the 2010 general election after proposals made by the boundary commissions for England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies) were adopted through statutory instruments. Constituencies in Scotland remained unchanged, as the Boundary Commission for Scotland had completed a review just before the 2005 \n\n The Cities of London and Westminster seat contains the two historical centres of the capital. The City of London is an international financial centre - while Westminster, home to the Houses of Parliament, Whitehall and Downing Street, represents Britain's political centre.\n\nQuestion: In which parliament has the UK 87 seats for members who are elected for a five0-year term?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Overall, the \n\n After joining the Ecology Party in 1977 (later becoming the Green Party of England and Wales), Lambert has held numerous positions, including Co-Chair of the Party Council (1982–85), Principal Speaker (1992–93 and 1998–99), Chair of the Party Executive (1993–94), Representative to the Federation of European Green Parties (1987–89 and 1998–99) and Political Liaison to the Green Group in the European Parliament (1989–92). She is currently the party's spokesperson on Migration. The Green Party were the official opposition on Norwich City Council; they formed part of the ruling coalition that controlled Lancaster City Council alongside the Liberal Democrats and Labour, and shared control of Castle Morpeth Council as part of an all party administration. In this period, the Green Party of England and Wales had representation in the House of Lords, the (unelected) upper chamber of Parliament: in the person of Lord Beaumont of Whitley, who died in 2008. According to MORI in 2010, Green issues were rated as importantly as during the Green Party's previous high point in the late 1980s. Leader at the time, Pippa Bartolotti, declared 2015 a 'record breaking year' for the party. The Green Party achieved its best ever UK general election result to date in the 2005 general election with a total of 281,780 votes, with Keith Taylor receiving 22% of the vote in Brighton Pavilion. In 2006 members of the Green Party of England and Wales launched the Green Left grouping within the party.

He succeeded Neville Chamberlain as prime minister on 10 May 1940 and held the post until 26 July 1945. Out of office during the 1930s, Churchill had taken the lead in calling for British re-armament to counter the growing threat of militarism in Nazi Germany. As prime minister, he oversaw British involvement in the Allied war effort against the Axis powers. Churchill is seen as a victorious wartime leader who played an important role in defending Europe's liberal democracy against the spread of fascism, though some wartime events like the 1945 bombing of Dresden have generated controversy. He was the most important of the Allied leaders during the first half of the Second World War. However, Herbert Morrison made it clear that the Labour Party would not be willing to accept this, and Churchill was forced to tender his resignation as Prime Minister and call an immediate election. Winston Churchill, who had long warned against Nazi Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after his predecessor Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the German invasion of Norway in April 1940.\n\nQuestion: Who were the two prime ministers of Britain during World War II?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Plurality voting is distinguished from a majoritarian electoral system in which a winning candidate must receive an absolute majority of votes: more votes than all other candidates combined. Under plurality voting, the leading candidate, whether or not he or she has a majority of votes, is elected. Both plurality and majoritarian systems may use single-member or multi-member constituencies. Plurality voting is an electoral system in which a candidate, or candidates, who poll more than any other counterpart (that is, receive a plurality), are elected. In a system based on multi-seat districts, it elects multiple candidates in a district and may be referred to as winner-takes-all, bloc voting or plurality block voting. It is used in most \n\n The United Kingdom, like the United States and Canada, uses single-member districts as the base for national elections. Henry Watson Fowler suggests that the American terms \"plurality\" and \"majority\" offer single-word alternatives for the corresponding two-word terms in British English, \"relative majority\" and \"absolute majority\", and that in British English \"majority\" is sometimes understood to mean \"receiving the most votes\" and can therefore be confused with \"plurality\". William Poundstone observes that systems which allow choosing by a plurality of votes are more vulnerable to the spoiler effect—where two or more similar choices each draw fewer votes than a dissimilar choice that would have lost to any individual similar choice on its own—than systems which require a majority.\n\nQuestion: \"What is the more common name of the \"\"simple plurality\"\" system of voting?\"\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the final quarter of the 18th century, the partnership installed hundreds of Boulton & Watt steam engines, which were a great advance on the state of the art, making possible the mechanisation of factories and mills. Boulton applied modern techniques to the minting of coins, striking millions of pieces for Britain and other countries, and supplying the Royal Mint with up-to-date equipment. Born in Birmingham, he was the son of a Birmingham manufacturer of small metal products who died when Boulton was 31. By then Boulton had managed the business for several years, and thereafter expanded it considerably, consolidating operations at the Soho Manufactory, built by him near Birmingham.

White coal manufacturing capacity is increasing in the state of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. The classification is sub-bituminous, which makes the coal similar to that found in Alberta and the Powder River Basin. There are two types of coal found in Pennsylvania: anthracite (the “hard coal” found in Northeastern Pennsylvania below the Allegheny Ridge southwest to Harrisburg; also called “stone coal”, “rock coal” in the 1800s) and bituminous (“soft coal”, found west of the Allegheny Front escarpment). Anthracite coal is a natural mineral with a high carbon and energy content that gives off light and heat (produced energy) when burned, making it useful as a fuel. It was possibly first used in Pennsylvania as a fuel in 1769, but its real history begins with a documented discovery near Summit Hill and the founding of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company \n\n  Ash is the waste product of coal that has been used to boil water. When coal is burned into fly ash the uranium and thorium in the unburned coal are concentrated at up to 10 times their original levels. Essentially, brown coal is sheared and attritioned reducing the mean particle size and releasing water naturally held in the porous coal microstructure forming a plastic mass.

The primary cell wall enables plant cells to develop turgor pressure, which is the internal hydrostatic pressure that pushes outward on the cell wall. This pressure is vital for cell expansion during growth and provides mechanical rigidity to plant tissues. Cellulose, being a strong and rigid polysaccharide, provides the primary cell wall with its mechanical strength. Furthermore, the presence of cellulose in the primary cell wall contributes to the resilience of plant cells. When a plant cell is subjected to mechanical stress, cellulose provides resistance and helps maintain the integrity of the cell wall. In summary, cellulose plays a crucial role in the primary cell wall of plants by providing tensile strength and contributing to the overall strength, resilience, and plasticity of plant cells. Its presence allows plant cells to develop turgor pressure, sustain internal hydrostatic pressure, and maintain their structural integrity even under mechanical stress. Reference:\n- The primary Cell Wall Is Built from Cellulose Microfibrils Interwoven with a Network of pectic polysaccharides\n\nFor the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Because of their crystalline structure, the individual cellulose microfibrils in the wall are unable to stretch, and this gives them a crucial role in the process.Complex wall-remodeling activities are required, as well as the deposition of new wall materials.These proteins are thought to strengthen the wall, and they are produced in greatly increased amounts as a local response to attack by pathogens. the network of cellulose and cross-linking glycans provides tensile strength, while the pectin network resists compression. Cellulose, cross-linking glycans, and pectin are typically present in roughly equal amounts in a primary cell wall. the middle lamella is especially rich in pectin, and it cements adjacent cells together. Once a plant cell has left the meristem where it is generated, it can grow dramatically, commonly by more than a thousand times in volume. For the cell wall to stretch or deform, the microfibrils must either slide past one another or become more widely separated, or both.Cells in plants therefore anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of the cellulose microfibrils that they deposit in the wall (Figure 19–64). cellulose, 35-50% ; xylan, 20-35%, a type of hemicellulose ; lignin, 10-25%, a complex phenolic polymer that penetrates the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin components, driving out water and strengthening the wall. In the primary (growing) plant cell wall, the major carbohydrates are cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. In plants, these cellulose microfibrils arrange themselves into layers, formally known as lamellae, and are stabilized in the cell wall by surface, long cross-linking glycan molecules. Coextensive in the primary cell wall to both cellulose microfibrils and complementary glycan networks, is pectin which is a polysaccharide that contains many negatively charged galacturonic acid units. It is believed that the plant can “anticipate their future morphology by controlling the orientation of microfibrils” by a mechanism where cellulose microfibrils are arranged atop a cortical array of microtubules. The formation of plant primary cell walls involves several components. Certain types of pectins are particularly abundant in the middle lamella, which is the region that cements adjacent cell walls together. Overall, the formation of plant primary cell walls involves the complex interplay between polysaccharides, including cellulose and pectins, and proteins. This combination of components provides strength, flexibility, and the ability to remodel the cell wall as necessary during plant growth.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the strong material found in plant cell walls?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the falling-rate period, water migration from the product interior to the surface is mostly by molecular diffusion, i,e. This means that water moves from zones with higher moisture content to zones with lower values, a phenomenon explained by the second law of thermodynamics. The drying rate in the falling-rate period is controlled by the rate of removal of moisture or solvent from the interior of the solid being dried and is referred to as being \"mass-transfer limited\". In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process (Greek: adiábatos, “impassable”) is a type of thermodynamic process that occurs without transferring heat or mass between the thermodynamic system and its environment. Unlike an isothermal process, an adiabatic process transfers energy to the surroundings only as work. As a key concept in thermodynamics, the adiabatic process supports the theory that explains the first law of thermodynamics. Some chemical and physical processes occur too rapidly for energy to enter or leave the system as heat, allowing a convenient \"adiabatic approximation\". For example, the adiabatic flame temperature uses this approximation to calculate the upper limit of flame temperature by assuming combustion loses no heat to its surroundings. There, the process becomes a pseudo-adiabatic process whereby the liquid water or salt that condenses is assumed to be removed upon formation by idealized instantaneous precipitation. The pseudoadiabatic process is only defined for expansion because a compressed parcel becomes warmer and remains undersaturated. temperature is needed for the vapor pressure to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated. Put in chemical potential terms, at the boiling point, the liquid phase and the gas (or vapor) phase have the same chemical potential (or vapor pressure) meaning that they are energetically equivalent. The chemical potential is dependent on the temperature, and at other temperatures either the liquid or the gas phase has a lower chemical potential and is more energetically favorable than the other phase. Firstly, the rate increases with increasing temperature. This is because higher temperatures provide more energy to the molecules, leading to increased kinetic motion and evaporation. This trend is attributed to the ideal mixing behavior of the two components, where the presence of ethylene glycol molecules hinders the evaporation of water molecules. It is important to note that the evaporation rates were examined in relation to the surface tension of the liquid mixture, but no definite relation between them was found.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the change of state from liquid to gas?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The primary outcome will be the change in score on a disease-specific-quality-of-life questionnaire, the Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire. Additionally, a process evaluation will be performed among patients and healthcare providers. It has been developed to classify patients, but also to provide visual insight into the burden of COPD and to provide treatment advice. More attention is paid to the impact of the disease on the patient’s life . Health status measurements have been propagated as an important part of managing COPD, both in primary and secondary care . Hence, we developed a new tool, the Assessment of Burden of COPD (ABC) tool, which consists of three elements. The first element is the ABC scale, a 14-item questionnaire that measures five different domains of the burden of disease as experienced by the patient: symptoms, functional state, mental state, emotional state, and fatigue. The second element comprises a number of additional indicators: smoking status, exacerbation history, dyspnoea, body mass index (BMI), lung function and physical activity. When combined with the ABC scale an overall assessment of a patient’s integrated health status is obtained. The third element is a computer program used to visualize the scores on all items into green, orange and red balloons and link treatment advice to these balloons (see Figure 1) . Visualization of the dimensions influencing integrated health status (Assessment of Burden of COPD tool), changed after treatment. The scale is based mainly on the Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ) , so we assume that it is a valid and reliable instrument. However, to be thorough we will analyse the internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Furthermore, we will analyse the convergent validity, divergent validity, known-group differences and responsiveness. During this period there are seven measurements, including a baseline and final measurement. The flow of the study is presented in Figure 2. To avoid contamination of care (i.e. Therefore, healthcare providers will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group in a 1:1 ratio with the help of a computer program designed by the Maastricht University Centre for Data and Information Management (MEMIC). The inclusion criteria will be: a confirmed diagnosis of COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity < 0.7) by spirometer, age 40 years or above, and the ability to understand and read the Dutch language. The actual intervention will be the use of the ABC tool by patients and healthcare providers during routine consultations. Patients will fill out the ABC scale, which measures the patient’s experienced burden of COPD, in the waiting room (without supervision) . These items and the ABC scale together will show the integrated health status of the patient, illustrated by a visual representation with coloured balloons. The balloons represent all of the patient’s health status items, including the different domains of the ABC scale (see\n\n Quadratic formula.svg expresses the solution of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 , where a is not zero, in terms of its coefficients a, b and c.]] Algebra (from الجبر) is one of the broad areas of mathematics. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. It includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra; the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, \n\nAn order: each number is either less or more than any other number. ; Algebraic structure: there are operations of multiplication and addition that make it into a field. ; A metric: there is a notion of distance between points. ; A geometry: it is equipped with a metric and is flat. ; A topology: there is a notion of open sets.

Advances in the numeral system and mathematical notation eventually led to the discovery of mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, and so forth. Eventually the operations were formalized, and concepts about the operations became understood well enough to be stated formally, and even proven. See, for example, Euclid's algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor of two numbers. By the High Middle Ages, the positional Hindu–Arabic numeral system had reached Europe, which allowed for systematic computation of numbers. During this \n\nCan Maths really save your life? Maths has applications to many problems that are vital to human health and happiness. Modern medicine relies heavily on imaging methods, starting with the early use of X-rays at the start of the 20th century. (The word tomography comes from the Greek work tomos meaning \"cut\" or \"slice\".) This article will look at this process in detail. These include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The basic mathematics behind tomography was worked out by the mathematician Johann Radon in 1917. It is the mathematics that we will describe here. Before delving into the depths of medical science, we will start with a simple example which illustrates the principles of tomography, and which has a very nice link to the various types of Sudoku that have become very popular recently. This example involves milk deliveries. At first sight it would seem impossible to solve this problem. However, we can peer in through the sides and we can measure how much light is absorbed in different directions. If a light beam is shone through several bottles, then this absorption adds up. If, for example, a light beam shines through a milk bottle and then a juice bottle, then 5 units are absorbed. In the example below we have indicated the total amount of light absorbed when shining light through each of the rows and each of the columns. We are faced with a rather unusual situation for a mathematician in that we have two perfectly plausible solutions to the same problem. To find out exactly how the bottles are distributed, we need to put in a little extra information. From this extra piece of information it is clear that the first solution, and not the second, corresponds to the measurements made. This problem may seem trivial, but it is very similar to the medical imaging problem we will describe in the next section, and shows how important it is to obtain enough information about a situation to make sure that we know what is going on exactly. If any of this looks familiar to newspaper readers, then it is. This is precisely the same as the problem described above. Any such operation carried a significant risk, especially in the case of problems with the brain. The degree to which this happens depends upon what material the ray passes through: its intensity is reduced more when passing through bone than when passing through muscle, an internal organ, or a tumour. We illustrate this below. A typical such X-ray is illustrated below. It was first studied by Johann Radon in 1917. (Radon is also famous for some very important discoveries related to the branch of mathematics called measure theory, which is the basis of integration.)\n\nQuestion: Which branch of science has four fundamental principles: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sliding friction occurs when two contacting surfaces move relative to each other, converting kinetic energy into thermal energy or heat. When contacting surfaces move relative to each other, the friction between the two objects converts kinetic energy into thermal energy, or heat. Both of these types of friction are called kinetic friction. Surface roughness and contact area, however, do affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces.

Surface roughness and contact area, however, do affect sliding friction for micro- and nano-scale objects where surface area forces dominate inertial forces. support force is an 'equal and opposite' force; we know this not because of Newton's third law, but because the object remains at rest, so that the forces must be balanced. To this support force there is also a 'reaction': the object pulls down on the supporting cable, or pushes down on the supporting surface or liquid. In this case, there are therefore four forces of equal magnitude:  Forces F1 and F2 are equal due of Newton's third law; the same is true for forces F3 and F4. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface.\n\nQuestion: What is the force that opposes the relative motion of two bodies that are in contact?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Each stride covered nine feet, his upper body moving up and down almost imperceptibly, his feet striking the track and rising so rapidly that his heels did not touch the ground. Last month, researchers at Southern Methodist University, among the leading experts on the biomechanics of sprinting, started considering a number of questions as Bolt prepares for what he said would be his final performances at a major international competition — the 100 metres and 4×100-metre relay next month at the world track and field championships in London. At its most basic, speed is the product of stride length times stride frequency. Though Bolt stands 6 feet 5 inches, he starts nearly as explosively as smaller sprinters and needs only 41 strides to cover 100 metres, while other elite runners need 43 or 45 or even 48. But once Bolt reaches top speed at 60 to 70 metres, he maintains his velocity more efficiently than others, decelerating less toward the finish line. The winner of a sprint is not the person speeding up the fastest at the end but slowing down the slowest. It was once widely assumed that the swiftest runners achieved top speed by swinging their legs more rapidly than slow runners while repositioning their limbs between takeoff and landing. In a 2000 study, Weyand, then working with a team at Harvard, determined that elite sprinters did not swing their legs appreciably quicker through the air. Instead, they gained maximum speed by striking the ground with a greater force than others in relation to their body weight, and for a shorter period of time. Sprinters like Bolt land just behind the ball of the foot, which strikes the ground at an angle of about 6 degrees. His lower leg decelerates abruptly, absorbing 16 Gs of force. His heel drops for only 0.02 seconds — the equivalent of an inch — before rising again. The total time spent on the ground with each stride is about 0.09 seconds. In effect, there is one biomechanical way for world-class sprinters to run extremely fast. The SMU researchers did not know that one of Bolt’s legs was longer than the other when they began their study six months ago. They were testing a new motion-based technique, called the two-mass model, which allows them to determine ground forces by using high-speed video of races instead of specially equipped treadmills in the lab. Because his right leg is shorter, it has a slightly longer drop to the track, contributing to a higher velocity for that step. A natural adaptation for Bolt has been to keep his left leg on the ground for slightly more time with each step — 0.097 seconds, compared with 0.085 seconds for the right leg. This gives him slightly more time to generate force with the left leg, Weyand said, providing greater lift off the ground. It is one of the most popular races in the world, and saw 46,950 entrants in 2016. The speed of the P. macropalpis is far in excess of the previous record holder, the Australian tiger beetle Cicindela eburneola, which is the fastest insect in the world relative to body size, with a recorded speed of 1.86 m/s, or 171 body lengths per second. The cheetah, the fastest land mammal, scores at only 16 body lengths per second, while Anna's hummingbird has the highest known length-specific velocity attained by any vertebrate.

Widely known as the fastest terrestrial animal with running speeds reaching 61 –, cheetahs take advantage of their speed during chases. However, their speed and acceleration also have disadvantages, as both rely on anaerobic metabolism and can only be sustained for short periods of time. Studies show that cheetahs can maintain maximum speed for up to a distance of approximately 500 yd, which is only about 20 seconds of sprinting, before fatigue and overheating set in. Due to these limitations, cheetahs are often observed quietly walking towards the prey to shorten the distance before running at \n\n The mite has been recorded at a speed of 322 body lengths per second (0.225 m/s).

Cyanobacteria, also known as Cyanophyta, are a phylum of Gram-negative bacteria that obtain energy via photosynthesis. The name cyanobacteria refers to their color, giving them their other name, \"blue-green algae\",  though modern botanists restrict the term algae to eukaryotes and do not apply it to cyanobacteria, which are prokaryotes. Cyanobacteria use photosynthetic pigments, such as carotenoids, phycobilins, and various forms of chlorophyll, which absorb energy from light. Phototrophic eukaryotes such as green plants perform photosynthesis in plastids that are thought to have their ancestry in \n\n extended spectral regions, such as the near-infrared. Chlorophyll, the most abundant plant pigment, is most efficient in capturing red and blue light. Accessory pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls harvest some green light and pass it on to the photosynthetic process, but enough of the green wavelengths are reflected to give leaves their characteristic color. Much chlorophyll is in photosystem II (light-harvesting complex II or LHC II), the most abundant membrane protein on earth. In the autumn, this complex is broken down. This is believed to \n\nChlorophyll plays a crucial role in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy. It is a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of algae and plants. This selective absorption of light is why chlorophyll-containing tissues appear green. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll molecules capture photons of light energy. These captured photons excite electrons within the chlorophyll molecule, causing them to become energized. In this stage, chlorophyll helps convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a sugar) through a series of chemical reactions. Overall, chlorophyll's ability to absorb light energy and transfer it to other molecules allows plants to carry out photosynthesis efficiently. Its green color arises from its selective absorption properties, reflecting or transmitting green light while absorbing other colors from the visible spectrum.

In rare cases, individuals who have regularly used kelp supplements have been found to have arsenic poisoning. To minimize this risk, it is advisable to choose kelp supplements from reputable manufacturers that test their products to ensure they do not contain high levels of arsenic, such as Platinum. On the positive side, sea vegetables like kelp do not contain significant amounts of certain toxins, such as PCBs and dioxins, which are commonly found in fish and shellfish. Furthermore, test-tube and animal studies suggest that kelp may have potential antiviral effects against influenza, herpes, and HIV infections. The brown algae (singular: alga), comprising the class Phaeophyceae, are a large group of multicellular algae, including many seaweeds located in colder waters within the Northern Hemisphere. For instance, Macrocystis, a kelp of the order Laminariales, may reach 60 m in length and forms prominent underwater kelp forests. Another example is Sargassum, which creates unique floating mats of seaweed in the tropical waters of the Sargasso Sea that serve as the habitats for many species. Many brown algae, such as members of the order Fucales, commonly grow along rocky seashores. Some members of the class, such as kelps, are used by humans as food.

Hemoproteins\nHuman proteins\n\nOne characteristic that differentiates hemoglobin from myoglobin is their respective functions in the body. Hemoglobin is primarily responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues, while myoglobin is mainly involved in storing and releasing oxygen within the muscle cells. Additionally, the structure of hemoglobin and myoglobin also differs. In contrast, myoglobin is a monomer, meaning it is composed of a single protein subunit with a heme group. This characteristic makes myoglobin better suited for oxygen storage in the muscle cells. In summary, the main characteristics that differentiate hemoglobin from myoglobin include their functions, structure, and their respective binding affinity for oxygen. Hemoglobin is involved in oxygen transport, consists of four protein subunits, and exhibits cooperative binding, while myoglobin plays a role in oxygen storage, is a single protein subunit, and has a higher oxygen affinity without cooperative binding. The physiological role of hemoglobin and myoglobin in the body is primarily related to their ability to bind molecular oxygen. On the other hand, myoglobin is a monomeric protein mainly found in muscle tissue and serves as an intracellular storage site for oxygen. Both hemoglobin and myoglobin have a heme group, which contains iron that binds to oxygen. Each myoglobin molecule contains a single heme group inserted into a hydrophobic cleft in the protein. In summary, hemoglobin and myoglobin play crucial roles in oxygen transport and storage in the body. Hemoglobin carries oxygen throughout the body, while myoglobin stores oxygen within muscle tissue. Both proteins rely on their heme groups, which bind and release oxygen as needed. Myoglobin (Mb) plays a significant role in terms of protein structure and oxygen storage. It is a small, globular protein primarily responsible for storing oxygen in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues. In terms of protein structure, early studies on myoglobin were important milestones in the field of protein structure determination. In terms of its role in oxygen storage, myoglobin helps regulate cellular oxygen tension in respiring tissues. This further highlights the physiological significance of myoglobin beyond its role in oxygen storage. It's worth mentioning that recent research involving myoglobin has included the development of assays for serum myoglobin detection and additives to preserve the red coloring of fresh meat. The study of myoglobin has also extended to non-muscle tissues of fish species and mammalian cancer cells, suggesting its potential involvement in other biological processes. Overall, myoglobin's significance lies in its role as an oxygen storage protein in muscle tissue and its contribution to regulating cellular oxygen tension and the bioavailability of nitric oxide.

Ruminant mammals, like cows, have a unique digestive system. They are often said to have four \"stomachs,\" but the first three chambers (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) are actually derived from the esophagus. These chambers are filled with bacteria and protozoans that help digest and ferment the ingested food. Microbes in the rumen and reticulum break down protein, starch, fats, and even cellulose. The larger particles are periodically regurgitated as cud, re-chewed, and then re-swallowed. The products of microbial action, along with some of the microbes themselves, move into the cow's true stomach and intestine for further digestion and absorption. This symbiotic relationship with microbes allows ruminants to digest cellulose, a component of their herbivorous diet that they cannot digest on their own. In summary, the stomach plays crucial roles in initiating digestion, converting food into a semi-liquid mixture (chyme), and releasing it into the small intestine. This process is adapted to the specific needs of different animal species, such as birds and ruminants, allowing them to efficiently digest their food and obtain nutrients from it. As the proteins are continuously broken down to smaller components, the bacteria excrete gases and organic compounds, such as the functional-group amines putrescine (from ornithine) and cadaverine (from lysine), which carry \n\n water and nutrient absorption of most plants and confers resistance to some plant pathogens. They are vital to agriculture and are important to almost all species of plants many species co-evolving with the fungi. \"Mycelium\", like \"fungus\", can be considered a mass noun, a word that can be either singular or plural. The digestive system of herbivorous lizards has undergone significant modification when compared to carnivorous lizards. For example, these animals store symbiotic microorganisms in the foregut and hindgut that specifically aid in the digestion of plant material. Much of the fermentation of the plant material occurs in the hindgut, or colon, where symbiotic organisms breakdown plant material that has otherwise been resistant to digestion. Most mammals have limited ability to digest dietary fiber such as cellulose. in the flora of the rumen, and these bacteria produce enzymes called cellulases that hydrolyze cellulose. Such enzymes are usually secreted as part of multienzyme complexes that may include dockerins and carbohydrate-binding modules.\n\nQuestion: What is the most abundant substance in the plant kingdom, which no mammal produces the enzyme to digest?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Paratrechina spp. Ants had a high capacity for carrying bacteria, and the isolates comprised 68.8% Gram-positive, spore-producing bacilli (Bacillus spp. Ants are social insects that live in symbiosis with humans and readily adapt to urban environments. The dispersion and increasing populations of urban ants are facilitated by several factors, the most important of which are: polygyny, unicolonial populations, migration of colonies, polidomic colonies, reproduction by fragmentation, small nest structure and workers with reduced size and without nuptial flight . Studies in two hospitals in Northeast Brazil have warned about the specific role of ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in the transport of pathogenic bacteria associated with hospital environments . Among social insects, ants make numerous parasitic and mutualistic relationships and develop multiple interactions with animals, plants, fungi and bacteria . Captured ants were subjected to morpho-dyeing; cultural, biochemical and microbiological analysis; and subsequently fixed in 80% alcohol. The ants were mounted on entomological pins and identified using pictorial keys keys and complete keys . The classification of ants was performed in collaboration with the Centre for the Study of Social Insects (CEIS) of the Institute of Biosciences of Rio Claro – UNESP, São Paulo, Brazil. The isolated pure colonies were seeded in specific environments for isolating particular microorganisms and subjected to morphological, cultural and biochemical analyses . In the captured ants, we calculated the absolute frequency, accumulated absolute frequency, relative frequency, and cumulative relative frequency of the isolated microorganisms. Seventy ants were captured from the evaluated sites; of which, 62.8% were of the genus Paratrechina and 25.7% were Monomorium floricola. Among the other ants found 7.1% were from the genus Dorymyrmex, 2.8% from Pheidole and 1.4% from Brachymyrmex (Table 1). 3 Klebsiella spp. ; 2 Bacillus spp. Among the bacteria isolated from the integument of captured ants, 45.7% were Bacillus spp., and other bacteria were Listeria spp. Considering only M. floricola and Paratrechina spp., the Fisher’s exact test was used to evaluate the hypothesis that the proportions of organisms were related to the type of ants (Table 3). Because there was a relationship between the variables, we tried to measure individual differences in the proportions of bacteria isolated from M. floricola and Paratrechina spp. In contrast, Bacillus spp. Considering only the environments where ants were captured, in the medical clinic, 64.3% of the ants were from the genus Paratrechina, followed by M. floricola (26.8%), Pheidole (3.6%), Dorymyrmex spp. (3.6%) and Brachymyrmex spp. In the obstetrics unit, 83.3% of the ants were Pratrechina spp., followed by 16.7% M. floricola. Larger colonies consist of various castes of sterile, wingless females, most of which are workers (ergates), as well as soldiers (dinergates) and other specialised groups. Nearly all ant colonies also have some fertile males called \"drones\" and one or more fertile females called \"queens\" (gynes). Ants have colonised almost every landmass on Earth. The only places lacking indigenous ants are Antarctica and a few remote or inhospitable islands. Their success in so many environments has been attributed to their social organisation and their \n\n Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest Early Cretaceous and early Late Cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 13,800 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed) antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists. Ants form colonies that range in size from a few dozen predatory individuals living in small natural cavities to highly organised colonies that may occupy large territories and \n\n they secrete (dihydronepetalactone, isodihydronepetalactone and iridomyrmecin). Meat ants are generally intolerant of myrmecophiles (which are insects or other organisms that share positive interspecies associations with ants) living in their colonies, but Cyclotorna larvae are known to dwell in colonies. Although Sphallomorpha larvae sometimes prey on workers as discussed earlier, some are inquilines and live in the nest commensally. Meat ants may deliberately destroy the colonies of the termite Amitermes laurensis if competition between the two intensify. Meat ants play an important role in seed dispersal. A meat ant colony is capable of dispersing 334,000 individual bellyache bush seeds per hectare, which shows a strong ant-seed relationship among the two. In the insect world, pheromones are extensively used for different purposes. For instance, ants use alarm pheromones to signal danger and alert other members of their colony. Food trail pheromones are another example commonly observed in insects like ants and bees. When they discover a food source, they release these pheromones to guide other members of their colony towards the food. Sex pheromones are crucial for reproductive communication among many species. Insects like moths and butterflies release specific sex pheromones that attract potential mates from long distances. Apart from insects, vertebrates also utilize pheromones for communication purposes. For instance, some mammals like dogs use pheromone signals to mark territory or communicate social information with other members of their species. Even plants have been found to communicate using pheromones. Some studies suggest that plants release airborne chemicals when under attack by herbivores, which can attract predators or parasitoids that feed on those herbivores. Overall, the examples mentioned above demonstrate how various species employ pheromones as a means of communication within their respective communities.\n\nQuestion: Which family of insects has species named 'drivers', 'weavers', 'and even individuals called 'soldiers'?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

By studying animals and their physiological responses to various treatments, scientists can enhance medical knowledge and develop better treatments for veterinary purposes. By studying the diseases in animals, researchers can develop vaccines, medications, and treatments that benefit both animals and humans. Furthermore, animals can play a crucial role in conservation efforts. By studying animals in their natural habitats and in controlled environments, researchers gain insights into their behaviors, life cycles, and the ecological systems they depend on. This information aids in the development of conservation plans, habitat management strategies, and species recovery programs, ultimately benefiting the animals themselves. In conclusion, animals used in scientific research can experience several potential benefits, including improved veterinary care, advancements in disease prevention and treatment, and contributions to conservation efforts. During the 1960s and 1970s, human ethologists faced several challenges when they began studying human behavior. Ethologists were accustomed to studying animal behavior, which often involved direct observation and experimentation. However, studying human behavior posed different challenges. Unlike animals in controlled laboratory settings, studying humans required access to natural environments such as kindergartens, schools, and communities. This was particularly important to ensure that the behavior being studied was a true representation of natural human behavior. Another challenge was the conceptual shift from studying animal behavior to studying human behavior. Ethologists had to adapt their knowledge and methodologies to the unique characteristics of human behavior. Studying human behavior raised questions about privacy, informed consent, and the ethical treatment of human subjects. Overall, the challenges faced by human ethologists in the 1960s and 1970s included developing appropriate methodologies for studying human behavior in natural settings, adapting to the unique characteristics of human behavior, and navigating the ethical considerations surrounding the study of human subjects. Studies of this variety are becoming increasingly important in the field. Behavioural studies interrelate functional and eco-morphology. Behavioural studies are particularly common in fisheries and in studying birds. A phenomenological approach can enhance our understanding of animal behavior in ethology, including a specific behavior pattern observed in mice, by providing insights into the psychological meaning and cognitive world of the animals. Unlike classical ethology, which focuses on the evolutionary, functional, mechanistic, and developmental aspects of behavior, phenomenology explores the mental processes and subjective experiences of animals. This approach encompasses empirical observations that offer preliminary insights into the behavior pattern, such as carrying the tail in mice. It recognizes that behavior cannot be solely attributed to external stimuli or physiological mechanisms. It draws on concepts and findings from both neuroscience and evolutionary biology. Historically, most empirical work in this field has focused on comparative neuroanatomy. One related field is comparative psychology, which examines behavior across different species to understand the evolution of cognitive abilities. By studying the evolutionary origins of neural circuits involved in behaviors such as foraging or mate selection, evolutionary neuroscience can shed light on how these circuits have been shaped by natural selection. Behavioral ecology examines how animals' behaviors are influenced by ecological factors. Finally, evolutionary psychology investigates how psychological traits may have evolved through natural selection. In summary, while empirical work in evolutionary neuroscience has primarily focused on comparative neuroanatomy, conceptually and theoretically it is connected to fields such as comparative psychology, neuroethology, developmental neurobiology, evo-devo, behavioral ecology, anthropology, and evolutionary psychology.\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the study of animal behavior?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The ultrastructure of stomata in these mosses is highly similar to each other, and less variable compared to tracheophytes (vascular plants). Both Oedipodium and Ephemerum have anatomical features such as the presence of a cuticle, water-conducting cells, and spongy tissues with large areas for gas exchange. However, there are some subtle differences between the two moss species. Oedipodium sporophytes have extensive spongy tissue along the apophysis, while Ephemerum has minimal substomatal cavities. The stomatal ultrastructure and wall thickenings are highly similar in both species. Additionally, the sporophytes of both mosses are covered by a cuticle that is thicker on the guard cells and extends along the walls surrounding the pore. These anatomical features in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses support the role of stomata in gas exchange and water transport during development and maturation. The presence of stomata exclusively on the capsules of these mosses suggests that stomata in moss may also play a role in drying and dispersal of spores. Overall, while there are some differences in specific anatomical features, the ultrastructure of stomata in Oedipodium and Ephemerum mosses is remarkably similar, highlighting the importance of stomata in land plants for gas exchange, water transport, and potentially spore dispersal. Bryophytes are non-vascular plants encompassing mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, which most often form symbioses with members from the cyanobacterial genus Nostoc. Depending on the host, the cyanobiont can be inside (endophytic) or outside the host (epiphytic). In mosses, cyanobacteria are major nitrogen fixers and grow mostly epiphytically, aside from two species of Sphagnum which protect the cyanobiont from an acidic-bog environment. In terrestrial Arctic environments, cyanobionts are the primary supplier of nitrogen to the ecosystem whether free-living or epiphytic with mosses. Cyanobacterial associations with liverworts are rare, with only four of 340 genera of liverworts harbouring symbionts. Two of the genera, Marchantia and Porella, are epiphytic, while the genera Blasia and Cavicularia are endophytic. In hornworts however, endophytic cyanobionts have been described in more than triple the number of genera relative to liverworts.

In the last couple of decades, developments in electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and the use of frozen tissue sections have enhanced the detail that can be observed in tissues. Animal tissues are grouped into four basic types: connective, muscle, nervous, and epithelial. Collections of tissues joined in structural units to serve a common function compose organs. For example, the origin of the cells comprising a particular tissue type may differ developmentally for different classifications of animals. By contrast, a true epithelial tissue is present only in a single layer of cells held together via occluding junctions called tight junctions, to create a selectively permeable barrier. Connective tissues are fibreous tissues. They are made up of cells separated by non-living material, which is called an extracellular matrix. For example, blood contains plasma as its matrix and bone's matrix is rigid. Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place. Blood, bone, tendon, ligament, adipose and areolar tissues are examples of connective tissues. One method of classifying connective tissues is to divide them into three types: fibrous connective tissue, skeletal connective tissue, and fluid connective tissue. Muscle tissue is separated into three distinct categories: visceral or smooth muscle, found in the inner linings of organs; skeletal muscle, typically attached to bones, which generate gross movement; and cardiac muscle, found in the heart where it contracts to pump blood throughout an organism. The epithelial tissues are formed by cells that cover the organ surfaces such as the surface of skin, the airways, the reproductive tract, and the inner lining of the digestive tract. The cells comprising an epithelial layer are linked via semi-permeable, tight junctions; hence, this tissue provides a barrier between the external environment and the organ it covers. Epithelial tissue helps to protect organs from microorganisms, injury, and fluid loss. Epithelial tissues help in elimination of waste. Apical Meristem - It is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of the stem and root. This meristem is responsible for the linear growth of an organ. Lateral Meristem - This meristem consist of cells which mainly divide in one plane and cause the organ to increase in diameter and growth. Lateral meristem usually occurs beneath the bark of the tree in the form of Cork Cambium and in vascular bundles of dicots in the form of vascular cambium. The activity of this cambium results in the formation of secondary growth. Intercalary Meristem - This meristem is located in between permanent tissues. Parenchyma (para - 'beside'; enchyma - 'tissue') is the bulk of a substance. In aquatic plants, large air cavities are present in parenchyma to give support to them to float on water. Some of parenchyma cells have metabolic waste and is known as idioblast. Spindle shape fibre also contained into this cell to support them and known as prosenchyma , succulent parenchyma also noted. It is a living tissue of primary body like Parenchyma. It occurs chiefly in hypodermis of stems and leaves. This type of tissues are mainly of two divisions: 1) Sclerenchyma fiber and 2) Sclereids. Schlerenchyma cells have a narrow lumen and are long and narrow and unicellular. Hence it is also called surface tissue. Most of the epidermal cells are relatively flat. The outer and lateral walls of the cell are often thicker than the inner walls. Xylem serves as a chief conducting tissue of vascular plants. Xylem tissue is organized in a tube-like fashion along the main axes of stems and roots. It consists of a combination of parenchyma cells, fibers, vessels, tracheids, and ray cells. Longer tubes made up of individual cells are vessels (tracheae), while vessel members are open at each end. Internally, there may be bars of wall material extending across the open space. These cells are joined end to end to form long tubes. Vessel members and tracheids are dead at maturity. Tracheids have thick secondary cell walls and are tapered at the ends. They do not have end openings such as the vessels. The tracheids ends overlap with each other, with pairs of pits present. \"A history of the development of histology up to the end of the nineteenth century\". Stems support the entire plant and have buds, leaves, flowers, and fruits. They conduct water and mineral nutrients through xylem tissue from roots upward, and organic compounds and some mineral nutrients through phloem tissue in any direction within the plant. The upward movement, known as the xylem pathway, occurs from the roots to the stems and leaves. This process is driven by transpiration, a process where water evaporates from the plant's leaves, creating a suction force that pulls water and nutrients upward. The xylem vessels in plants are responsible for this upward transportation of nutrients. The phloem vessels are responsible for transporting sugars and other organic compounds synthesized in the leaves to the rest of the plant, including the roots.\n\nQuestion: What has a central vein called a midrib?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

They have stout bodies with large heads, long chisel-like incisors, brown or gray fur, hand-like front feet, webbed back feet and flat, scaly tails. Some common animal species are: mergansers, Canada geese, buffleheads, bald eagles, osprey, rainbow trout, smallmouth bass, pumpkinseed sunfish, river otters, red-winged blackbirds, Savannah sparrows, Columbia black-tailed deer, red-legged frogs, yellow warblers, chestnut-backed chickadees, screech owl, and the giant \n\n Competition between the English and the French was disastrous on the beaver population. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. Muskrats are most active at night or near dawn and dusk. They feed on cattail and other aquatic vegetation. They do not store food for the winter, but sometimes eat the insides of their push-ups. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife \n\n The muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is a medium-sized semiaquatic rodent native to North America and an introduced species in parts of Europe, Asia, and South America. The muskrat is found in wetlands over a wide range of climates and habitats. It has important effects on the ecology of wetlands, and is a resource of food and fur for humans. They are covered with short, thick fur of medium to dark brown color.\n\nQuestion: Which mammal constructs a lodge in which to store food, rear young, and pass the winter?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Firstly, the timing of fine root development and cortex sloughing differs between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. In aquatic environments, fine root development and cortex sloughing occur later compared to terrestrial habitats. In both aquatic and terrestrial roots, secondary growth occurs in the vascular cambium, producing secondary xylem and phloem, and in the phellogen, producing cork. However, there are distinct differences between the roots in aquatic and terrestrial environments. Aquatic adventitious roots of Metasequoia glyptostroboides have multiple lignified phi (Φ) thickenings throughout the cortex, larger air spaces, dilated parenchyma, and dense suberin and lignin depositions in the exodermis. Overall, the phenotypic plasticity in the structure of fine adventitious roots plays a crucial role in enabling Metasequoia glyptostroboides to thrive in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Not to be confused with seaweed, plant-like algae, or with beachgrass, a terrestrial plant. There are about 60 species of fully marine seagrasses which belong to four families (Posidoniaceae, Zosteraceae, Hydrocharitaceae and Cymodoceaceae), all in the order Alismatales (in the class of monocotyledons). The name seagrass stems from the many species with long and narrow leaves, which grow by rhizome extension and often spread across large \"meadows\" resembling grassland; many species superficially resemble terrestrial grasses of the family Poaceae. Like all autotrophic plants, seagrasses photosynthesize, in the submerged photic zone, and most occur in shallow and sheltered coastal waters anchored in sand or mud bottoms. Aquatic plants are plants that have adapted to living in aquatic environments (saltwater or freshwater). Some plants have the capability of  absorbing  pollutants \n\n  Aquaculture (less commonly spelled aquiculture ), also known as aquafarming, is the controlled cultivation (\"farming\") of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. Mariculture, commonly known as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats, opposed to in freshwater aquaculture. Seaweeds are multicellular marine algae and, although their ecological impact is similar to other larger water plants, they are not typically referred to as macrophytes. The most common adaptation is the presence of lightweight internal packing cells, aerenchyma, but floating leaves and finely dissected leaves are also common. Aquatic plants can only grow in water or in soil that is frequently saturated with water. They are therefore a common component of wetlands.\n\nQuestion: What is the generic word for plants that grow in water or water-logged conditions?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This can be caused by a physical barrier, such as other teeth, or when the tooth is angled away from a vertical position. Wisdom teeth likely become impacted because of a mismatch between the size of the teeth and the size of the jaw. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by their direction of impaction, their depth compared to the biting surface of adjacent teeth and the amount of the tooth's crown that extends through gum tissue or bone. The long-term risk of coronectomy is that chronic infection can persist from the tooth remnants. The prognosis for the second molar is good following the wisdom teeth removal with the likelihood of bone loss after surgery increased when the extractions are completed in people who are 25 years of age or older. Wisdom teeth have been described in the ancient texts of Plato and Hippocrates, the works of Darwin and in the earliest manuals of operative dentistry. Classification All teeth are classified as either developing, erupted (into the mouth), embedded (failure to erupt despite lack of blockage from another tooth), or impacted. Impacted teeth are ones that fail to erupt due to blockage from other teeth. Wisdom teeth, as the last teeth to erupt in the mouth are the most likely to become impacted. They develop between the ages of 14 and 25, with 50% of root formation completed by age 16, and 95% of all teeth erupted by the age of 25, however, some tooth movement can continue beyond the age of 25. Impacted wisdom teeth are classified by the direction and depth of impaction, the amount of available space for tooth eruption, and the amount of soft tissue or bone (or both) that covers them. Wisdom teeth are also classified by the presence (or absence) of symptoms and disease. One review found that 11% of wisdom teeth will have evidence of disease and are symptomatic, 0.6% will be symptomatic but have no disease, 51% will be asymptomatic but have disease present and 37% will be asymptomatic and have no disease. Each of these factors is used to predict the difficulty (and rate of complications) when removing an impacted tooth, with age being the most reliable predictor rather than the orientation of the impaction. Another classification system often taught in U.S. dental schools is known as Pell and Gregory Classification. This system includes a horizontal and vertical component to classify the location of third molars (predominately applicable to lower third molars): the third molar's relationship to the level of the teeth already in the mouth, being the vertical or x-component and to the anterior border of the ramus being the horizontal or y-component. Signs and symptoms Impacted wisdom teeth without communication to the mouth, that have no pathology associated with the tooth, and have not caused tooth resorption on the blocking tooth, rarely have symptoms. The chances of developing pathology on an impacted wisdom tooth that is not communicating with the mouth is approximately 12%. The tissue overlying the tooth is called the operculum, and the disorder is called pericoronitis which means inflammation around the crown of the tooth. Low grade chronic periodontitis commonly occurs on either the wisdom tooth or the second molar, causing less obvious symptoms such as bad breath and bleeding from the gums. The teeth can also remain asymptomatic (pain free), even with disease. Because the wisdom teeth are the last to erupt, due to insufficient room in the jaws to accommodate more teeth, the wisdom teeth become stuck in the jaws, i.e., impacted. There is a genetic predisposition to tooth impaction. Genetics plays an important, albeit unpredictable role in dictating jaw and tooth size and tooth eruption potential of the teeth. Since the tooth never erupts, however, the dental follicle that surrounds the tooth does not degenerate during eruption, and can develop cysts or uncommon tumors over time. Estimates of the incidence of cysts or other neoplasms (almost all benign) around impacted teeth average at 3%, usually seen in people under the age of 40. The rate of cavities on the back of the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease.

The rate of cavities on the back of the second molar has been reported anywhere from 1% to 19% with the wide variation attributed to increased age. Teeth with periodontal pockets of greater than 5mm have tooth loss rates that start at 10 teeth lost per 1000 teeth per year at 5mm to a rate of 70 teeth lost per year per 1000 teeth at 11mm. The risk of periodontal disease and caries on third molars increases with age with a small minority (less than 2%) of adults age 65 years or older maintaining the teeth without caries or periodontal disease and 13% maintaining unimpacted wisdom teeth without caries or periodontal disease. The last ones to erupt are the four molars, one in each quarter, known as ‘wisdom tooth’. When the wisdom teeth start erupting, often there is short of space. This space crunch therefore does impede their full growth (eruption) into the mouth. Such infections give symptoms such as swelling over the back part of the jaw, inability to open the mouth (trismus), pain especially to bite on the area, a bad taste, and bad breath. Since wisdom teeth are the last teeth to erupt, they often create space by pushing other teeth in line when they finally emerge. In some cases, wisdom teeth come through the gums only partially or not at all (impaction). In some cases, wisdom teeth emerge normally and do not cause any pain or other symptoms. A tooth that only partially erupts creates an opening for bacteria to create an infection (pericoronitis), leading to tenderness or swelling around the gums, jaw stiffness and general illness. Wisdom teeth are also susceptible to dental decay and gum disease (periodontal disease) and their presence may contribute to decay or gum disease in the adjacent molar tooth. It is also faced as a complication of removing a tooth, or from infection or trauma. Sometimes the roots of a tooth are so close to the bone under a maxillary sinus that the bone is damaged when the tooth is removed.

The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. On the other hand, glucagon, which is released by alpha cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect of raising blood sugar levels. Many tissues monitor the levels of glucose in the blood, but pancreatic islet cells are particularly important in this process. When blood glucose levels deviate from the desired range, the pancreas adjusts insulin and glucagon secretion accordingly to restore balance. In summary, blood sugar levels are regulated through a complex interplay of hormones, primarily insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas. Insulin promotes the uptake and storage of glucose, while glucagon stimulates the release of stored glucose. This tight regulation is referred to as glucose homeostasis. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process.

The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. The levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the pancreatic islets are among the most well understood and important. Glucagon\nIf the blood glucose level falls to dangerously low levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the alpha cells of the pancreas release glucagon, a hormone which travels through the blood to  the liver, where it binds to glucagon receptors on the surface of liver cells and stimulates them to break down glycogen stored inside the cells into glucose (this process is called glycogenolysis). It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. Insulin\nWhen levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of glycogen conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from beta cells found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. This hormone, insulin, causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called glycogenesis), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily muscle and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the GLUT4 transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar.

In humans, other mammals, and birds, the heart is divided into four chambers: upper left and right atria and lower left and right ventricles. Fish, in contrast, have two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles have three chambers. In a healthy heart blood flows one way through the heart due to heart valves, which prevent backflow. The heart is enclosed in a protective sac, the pericardium, which also contains a small amount of fluid. The wall of the heart is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node. From here it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation, through the lungs where it receives oxygen and gives off carbon dioxide. Oxygenated blood then returns to the left atrium, passes through the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the systemic circulation−where the oxygen is used and metabolized to carbon dioxide. Structure Location and shape The human heart is situated in the mediastinum, at the level of thoracic vertebrae T5-T8. A double-membraned sac called the pericardium surrounds the heart and attaches to the mediastinum. The largest part of the heart is usually slightly offset to the left side of the chest (though occasionally it may be offset to the right) and is felt to be on the left because the left heart is stronger and larger, since it pumps to all body parts. Because the heart is between the lungs, the left lung is smaller than the right lung and has a cardiac notch in its border to accommodate the heart. An adult heart has a mass of 250–350 grams (9–12 oz). The heart is often described as the size of a fist: 12 cm (5 in) in length, 8 cm (3.5 in) wide, and 6 cm (2.5 in) in thickness, although this description is disputed, as the heart is likely to be slightly larger. Chambers The heart has four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The atria open into the ventricles via the atrioventricular valves, present in the atrioventricular septum. This distinction is visible also on the surface of the heart as the coronary sulcus. There is an ear-shaped structure in the upper right atrium called the right atrial appendage, or auricle, and another in the upper left atrium, the left atrial appendage. The ventricles are separated from each other by the interventricular septum, visible on the surface of the heart as the anterior longitudinal sulcus and the posterior interventricular sulcus. It forms the atrioventricular septum, which separates the atria from the ventricles, and the fibrous rings, which serve as bases for the four heart valves. The interatrial septum separates the atria, and the interventricular septum separates the ventricles. The interventricular septum is much thicker than the interatrial septum since the ventricles need to generate greater pressure when they contract. Valves The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers. One valve lies between each atrium and ventricle, and one valve rests at the exit of each ventricle. The valves between the atria and ventricles are called the atrioventricular valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. During the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle, the papillary muscles are also relaxed and the tension on the chordae tendineae is slight. As the heart chambers contract, so do the papillary muscles. Two additional semilunar valves sit at the exit of each of the ventricles. This too has three cusps which close with the pressure of the blood flowing back from the aorta. Right heart The right heart consists of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the tricuspid valve. In the wall of the right atrium is an oval-shaped depression known as the fossa ovalis, which is a remnant of an opening in the fetal heart known as the foramen ovale. The heart serves as a pump controlling the blood flow in two circuits, the pulmonary and the systemic. Divisions of the Heart. The lower chambers are called ventricles and the upper chambers are called atria. The atrioventricular valves connect an atrium and a ventricle: between the right atrium and right ventricle is the tricuspid valve and between the left atrium and left ventricle is the mitral valve. Layers of the Heart. Its chambers are lined by a delicate membrane, the endocardium. Thus during diastole, the relaxation phase, oxygen-poor blood returning from the systemic circulation and accumulated in the right atrium pours into the right ventricle. The walls of both atria contract to press blood into the relaxed ventricles. In the next contraction phase (systole), the valves between the atria and ventricles close and the ventricles contract, forcing the blood through the pulmonary artery and the aorta. At the end of the contraction the pulmonary and aortic valves snap shut, preventing any backward flow of the blood into the ventricles. Diastole follows, the ventricles again filling with the blood from their respective atria, and the cycle is repeated. Disorders of the Heart. The heart is subject to a variety of disorders. Among them are congenital heart defects, which begin or exist at the time of birth. tetralogy of fallot and patent ductus arteriosus are examples of congenital heart defects. Many different diagnostic procedures are available for the examination of the heart. Cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures, the orifice area of valves, and the degree of left-to-right shunting can be determined. The films show the size and motion of the heart chambers and can demonstrate aortic or mitral regurgitation. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In most mammals and birds, including humans, the heart is divided into four chambers. These chambers consist of two upper chambers called atria and two lower chambers called ventricles. The oxygenated blood returns to the heart through the left atrium. It then flows into the left ventricle, which is responsible for pumping the oxygenated blood out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The smooth and coordinated flow of blood through the heart is facilitated by the presence of heart valves. Additionally, the heart is enclosed in a protective sac called the pericardium, which contains a small amount of fluid. It's worth noting that fish have two-chambered hearts, consisting of an atrium and a ventricle, while reptiles typically have three-chambered hearts. The unique four-chambered heart found in most mammals and birds allows for efficient oxygenation and circulation of blood throughout the body. Reference:\n\"The heart is a muscular organ in most animals...\"\n\nThe heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system.

Anatomy The largest muscle of the posterior hip, gluteus maximus, is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve. It branches out and then enters the deep surface of the gluteus maximus, the principal extensor of the thigh, and supplies it. The sacral plexus is formed in the pelvis in front of the piriformis muscle. The sacral plexus is formed anterior to the piriformis muscle and gives rise to the sciatic nerve, the superior and inferior gluteal nerves, and the pudendal and posterior femoral cutaneous nerves. However, most of the sacral plexus nerves are scarcely recognizable, because they leave the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. From the pelvis, the anterior primary branches of the nerves entering the plexus (the first sacral nerve being a particularly large one) and a mass of nerves on the piriformis can be recognized. Course The inferior gluteal nerve leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen and runs underneath the piriformis muscle. It then divides into muscular branches to supply the gluteus maximus that pass posteriorly into the deep surface of the gluteus maximus muscle. It has been described as having multiple branches with subsequent innervation of the overlying gluteus maximus. At the lower border of the piriformis muscle, the nerve turns backward and divides into upward and downward diverging branches, which enter the gluteus maximus. The nerve may also send a branch to the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve. The inferior gluteal nerve reliably emerged inferior to the piriformis muscle. There were two to three divisions of the inferior gluteal nerve under the piriformis that would further divide close to the insertion of the nerve into the actual muscle belly. In all specimens, the nerve entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus approximately 5 cm from the tip of the greater trochanter of the femur and entered the deep surface of gluteus maximus over the inferior one-third of the muscle belly. There is a relationship between the common stalk of the inferior gluteal nerve and external anatomic landmarks. This will result in maximal stimulation of the gluteus maximus musculature when using electrical stimulation for the purpose of prevention of pressure ulcers. Function The major function of the gluteus maximus is to extend the flexed thigh and bring it inline with the trunk. The gluteus maximus, a large muscle with numerous attachments, is a powerful extensor of the thigh or of the trunk lower limbs are in a fixed position. It extends thigh at the hip, assists in laterally rotating the thigh. Surprisingly, however, the gluteus maximus is not important posturally, is relaxed when one is standing, and is little used in walking. When a muscle-splitting incision is made across gluteus maximus as part of the classical posterior approach and the muscle parted by hand-held or self-retaining retractors, the likelihood of damage to the inferior gluteal nerve is high. The nerve enters the deep surface of the muscle and is not easily visualised and differentiated from other structures running with it, such as the blood vessels. Parting the muscle damages the nerve further by stretching or even rupturing its branches which run superiorly on its deep surface.

The piriformis muscle is pear-shaped and lies deep to the gluteus medius muscle. On the other hand, the gluteus maximus muscle is the largest and most superficial muscle in the gluteal region. The fibers of the gluteus maximus run inferolaterally and attach distally to the iliotibial tract and gluteal tuberosity of the femur. This muscle can extend the thigh from a flexed position when the pelvis is fixed, aid in strong lateral rotation of the thigh, and contribute to strong abduction at the hip. It also helps rotate the pelvis posteriorly on the femur heads when the thigh is stabilized. The gluteus maximus muscle is innervated by the inferior gluteal nerve and is important for stabilizing the femur on the tibia. In summary, the piriformis muscle is involved in gait and maintaining balance, while the gluteus maximus muscle is responsible for posture, thigh extension, lateral rotation, abduction, and stabilizing the femur on the tibia. Anterior and posterior movement of the hip joint capsule may help optimize the patient's stretching capacity. The muscle can be manually stretched by applying pressure perpendicular to the long axis of the muscle and parallel to the surface of the buttocks until the muscle is relaxed. Anterior compartment muscles of the thigh include sartorius, and the four muscles that comprise the quadriceps muscles- rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius and vastus lateralis. Posterior compartment muscles of the thigh are the hamstring muscles, which include semimembranosus, semitendinosus, and biceps femoris. Because the major muscles of the thigh are the largest muscles of the body, resistance exercises (strength training) of them stimulate blood flow more than any other localized activity.

This term refers to the collapsed follicle that has produced an egg in any particular cycle. Lesions also occur in the ovaries, the fallopian tubes and the pelvic sidewall. The fallopian tubes transport the egg from the ovaries to the uterus. There are two fallopian tubes in a woman’s body; both of which are lined with tiny hair-like projections called cilia, which assist the egg’s movement towards the uterus. The fallopian tubes can also be damaged by endometriosis. This procedure is used if the fimbria, the fringe of tissue located close to the ovaries that leads to the fallopian tubes and wafts the egg towards the uterus, are immobile and therefore blocking the ovum’s passage. It is produced once the embryo is implanted. This generally occurs two weeks after conception, once the sperm has fertilized the egg, which occurs up to 24 hours after ovulation. Around the middle of your menstrual cycle, estrogen triggers a surge of LH, which causes the strongest egg to burst through the ovary wall and move towards the uterus. This term refers to the latter half of the menstrual cycle during which the corpus luteum produces progesterone to maintain the endometrial lining of the uterus, in the hopes of an egg being fertilized. When the corpus luteum stops producing progesterone, it disintegrates and your period begins. The luteal phase is usually no longer than 10 days in length. Ovaries are the place where your egg follicles are storied; women have two ovaries, one on each side of the uterus. Each month, one egg follicle matures and releases an egg into the fallopian tubes. The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which are central to the proper functioning of the reproductive system. Since the ovaries are responsible for releasing the eggs into the fallopian tubes, PCOS hinders your ability to get pregnant. It is essential in building and maintaining the lining of the uterus into which the fertilized egg can implant and continue to grow. This abnormality is known as a defective or inadequate luteal phase. Blocked or scarred tubes can lead to infertility, and can be detected during a laparoscopy. In this procedure, a balloon is inserted into the fallopian tube using a catheter. Ten to twenty percent of couples experience unexplained infertility. However, couples who experience unexplained infertility still have a 1 to 6 percent chance of getting pregnant each month. The uterus is a muscular organ comprised of three layers: the peritoneum (outer layer), myometrium (middle layer) and endometrium (inner lining). An egg that has been fertilized will implant itself into the endometrium lining; the egg will then continue to develop in the uterus throughout the pregnancy. After the monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone called GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). Among these follicles, one will become dominant and continue its maturation process. When the dominant follicle is fully mature, LH triggers its release from the ovary, a process known as ovulation. The released egg then travels through the fallopian tube to the uterus for potential fertilization. After ovulation, the follicle quickly transforms into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum then produces progesterone, which prepares the uterus for potential implantation. After ovulation, several physiological changes occur in the female reproductive system. One significant change is the transformation of the ruptured follicle into a structure called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes hormones such as progesterone and estrogen, which play essential roles in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. This thickening prepares the uterus for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. The ovulation process, which marks the release of an egg from the follicle, is triggered by a surge in luteinizing hormone (LH). This surge induces the release of the mature egg, which then travels through the fallopian tube towards the uterus, potentially for fertilization. These physiological changes in the female reproductive system after ovulation are crucial for the regulation of the menstrual cycle and the preparation of the uterus for potential pregnancy. In order to achieve pregnancy, ovulation (release of the egg from the ovary) must occur. We know this because in order for a period to come regularly there are certain events that must occur in the ovary and uterus. First, several of the immature eggs present in the ovary at the beginning of the cycle will begin developing and growing. The older a woman is, the less eggs are available every month. During the first 9 or 10 days of the cycle, one of the eggs is selected by the ovary to be the “dominant” egg that will eventually mature completely and be released. While it is maturing, the ovary produces estrogen which tells the brain that the ovary is working and also causes thickening of the uterine lining getting ready for implantation of a fertilized egg. Once this egg reaches maturity within its follicle (fluid filled cavity), a surge of hormones from the brain called LH (luteinizing hormone which can be measured by an ovulation predictor kit) causes release of the egg from its follicle. Once the egg is released, the now empty follicle is called a corpus luteum cyst and has the sole purpose of producing the hormone progesterone which acts as the glue keeping the uterine lining intact in preparation for an embryo implanting. The egg will then be picked up by one of the fallopian tubes and hopefully become fertilized by sperm in the tube and then travel into the uterus where it will implant into the thickened uterine wall. If the egg is successfully fertilized by a sperm and does successfully implant into the wall, the tissue releases human chorionic gonadotropin HCG hormone (the hormone of pregnancy) which causes pregnancy tests to turn positive. How Many Days Out of the Month is a Woman Fertile? Many people often ask, “How many days out of the month is a woman fertile?” The answer is varies from person to person, however, typically women ovulate for about 5-6 days every month.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The sinoatrial node, which acts as the heart's natural pacemaker, consists of pacemaker cells that generate electrical impulses. The rate of action potentials produced by the SA node cells, and therefore the heart rate, can be affected by the autonomic nervous system. This binding increases the permeability of the SA node cells to calcium and enhances the rate of action potentials, resulting in an increased heart rate. Conversely, the parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic receptors on the SA node cells. This binding decreases the permeability of the SA node cells to calcium and potassium, leading to a slower rate of action potentials and hence a decreased heart rate. In addition to the autonomic nervous system, other factors can influence the heart rate set by the sinoatrial node. It is important to note that while the sinoatrial node plays a central role in setting the heart rate, it does not solely determine it. Reference:\n- Sinoatrial node (SA node) - Anatomy, Function, Regulation. Retrieved from https://www.lecturio.com/concepts/sinoatrial-node-sa-node/\n\nThe part with the highest autonomy in the human body is the sinoatrial (SA) node, also known as the sinus node or the sinus pacemaker. From there, the signal is transmitted to the ventricles, leading to their contraction and pumping blood to the rest of the body. The SA node has its own intrinsic rhythm, independent of external signals. One percent of the cardiomyocytes in the myocardium possess the ability to generate electrical impulses (or action potentials) spontaneously. A specialized portion of the heart, called the sinoatrial node (SA node), is responsible for atrial propagation of this potential. These cells are modified cardiomyocytes. The pacemaker cells are connected to neighboring contractile cells via gap junctions, which enable them to locally depolarize adjacent cells. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically. The rhythm of the heart's contractions is determined by a group of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is located in the right atrium of the heart. These pacemaker cells generate electrical impulses that stimulate the contraction of the heart muscle.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) are secreted pulsatively, stimulating the maturation of the ovarian follicle. The increase in estrogen and progesterone levels leads to enhanced pituitary sensitivity to GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone). After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. Hormones also play a crucial role in other stages of reproduction. During fetal development, sex determination occurs under the influence of hormone signaling. In conception, hormones such as LH and FSH are involved in the regulation of the menstrual cycle and ovulation. After conception, various hormones including progesterone, estrogen, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and prolactin support the development of pregnancy, maintenance of the pregnancy, and initiation of lactation. Overall, hormones play a vital role in each stage of reproduction by regulating the development and function of reproductive organs, controlling the menstrual cycle, supporting pregnancy, and facilitating the physiological changes associated with sexual maturation and menopause. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gonads play crucial roles in regulating sex hormones. The hypothalamus, located in the brain, releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) into the bloodstream. In response to GnRH, the pituitary gland releases two important hormones: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). In males, LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, an androgen hormone responsible for male sexual characteristics. FSH, on the other hand, promotes the production of sperm by stimulating the cells in the testes called Sertoli cells. Together, testosterone and sperm production are regulated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad axis in males. The follicles then produce estrogen, which is responsible for the development of female sexual characteristics. Overall, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, which stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH. The oocyte will now travel down one of the \n\n by the theca cells, inciting theca cells to create more androgen that will become estrogen downstream. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation. Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. They provide structural support, help in hormone production and release, and create a blood-testis barrier. In the male hypothalamus-pituitary-testis axis, the hypothalamus releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary gland to release follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). FSH promotes the maturation of Sertoli cells, while LH stimulates Leydig cells to produce testosterone. After ovulation, the remaining follicle forms the corpus luteum. The steroidogenic pathways in the ovaries involve the conversion of cholesterol to androgens, which are then converted to estrogen or progesterone. In the female hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis during the menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus releases GnRH, stimulating the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. FSH promotes follicular development, while LH triggers ovulation and the formation of the corpus luteum. It thickens during the proliferative phase in response to estrogen stimulation and prepares for potential implantation.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Fossil fuel combustion, which became prevalent during the Industrial Revolution, has led to increased emissions of greenhouse gases and pollutants into the atmosphere. These emissions have contributed to climate change and air pollution, affecting the troposphere. The combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary greenhouse gas, that traps heat in the atmosphere and leads to global warming. Additionally, combustion processes produce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx), which can react in the atmosphere and contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain. Agriculture, another significant contributor to tropospheric impact, has increased rapidly to support the growing global population. For example, the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers can lead to the release of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. These chemicals can undergo reactions in the atmosphere, leading to the formation of secondary pollutants and negatively affecting air quality. In summary, activities such as fossil fuel combustion, agriculture, alterations in land use, and the release of certain chemicals have significantly impacted the troposphere in the Anthropocene era. These impacts include climate change, air pollution, and alterations in atmospheric composition, all of which have implications for human health, visibility, climate, and weather. A better understanding of the connections between emissions, reactions, deposition, and atmospheric composition is crucial for developing strategies to minimize the impacts of these anthropogenic activities. Although common in nature – both terrestrially and in the outer planets of the Solar System – and in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous in its concentrated form. Natural gas (mostly methane) is an even more potent greenhouse house when it escapes into the atmosphere prior to being burned. For example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. For some of these processes, the presence of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium. Argon is denser than air and displaces oxygen close to the ground during inert gas asphyxiation. Nitrogen, which makes up about 78.1% of the air we breathe, is relatively unreactive due to its strong triple bonds between nitrogen molecules. This makes it difficult to directly convert nitrogen into useful compounds like ammonia. This has facilitated the production of important compounds like nitrate fertilizers and munitions while also finding applications in various industries.\n\nQuestion: What is the second most common gas in the atmosphere?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

These practices can help reduce the amount of runoff and minimize the impact on downstream water bodies. Some lake water is eutrophic due to agricultural pollution. ; Algae can be used to capture fertilizers in runoff from farms. When subsequently harvested, the enriched algae can be used as fertilizer. ; Aquaria and ponds can be filtered using algae, which absorb nutrients from the water in a device called an algae scrubber, also known as an algae turf scrubber. Agricultural Research Service scientists found that 60–90% of nitrogen runoff and 70–100% of phosphorus runoff can be captured from manure effluents using a horizontal algae scrubber, also called an algal turf scrubber (ATS). These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations. Agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers, and currently draws from those underground water sources \n\nSurface runoff from farm fields during heavy rainstorms can have several potential consequences. One major concern is the erosion of topsoil. Additionally, surface runoff can carry agricultural fertilizers and pesticides into nearby water bodies. These chemicals can contribute to water pollution, leading to eutrophication (excessive nutrient enrichment) and harmful algal blooms. Moreover, surface runoff may transport sediment and other pollutants such as bacteria or pathogens from livestock waste into streams, rivers, or lakes. To mitigate these consequences, various best management practices (BMPs) have been implemented on farms. These include contour plowing, strip cropping, cover crops, and buffer zones along water bodies. These measures help reduce soil erosion and limit the amount of runoff reaching waterways while also promoting soil conservation and protecting water quality. Overall, it is crucial for farmers to implement sustainable farming practices that minimize surface runoff and its potential negative impacts on both agricultural productivity and environmental health.

Activity (radioactivity): the rate of decay of radioactive material expressed as the number of atoms breaking down per second measured in units called becquerels or curies. For more information, see Chapter 2 of CDC’s Fallout Report at https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/fallout/feasibilitystudy/Technical_Vol_1_Chapter_2.pdfCdc-pdf . Certain radioactive nuclei emit alpha particles. Alpha particles generally carry more energy than gamma or beta particles, and deposit that energy very quickly while passing through tissue. Alpha particles can be stopped by a thin layer of light material, such as a sheet of paper, and cannot penetrate the outer, dead layer of skin. Therefore, they do not damage living tissue when outside the body. When alpha-emitting atoms are inhaled or swallowed, however, they are especially damaging because they transfer relatively large amounts of ionizing energy to living cells. See also beta particle, gamma ray, neutron, x-ray. Americium (Am): a silvery metal; it is a man-made element whose isotopes Am-237 through Am-246 are all radioactive. Trace quantities of americium are widely used in smoke detectors, and as neutron sources in neutron moisture gauges. Background radiation: ionizing radiation from natural sources, such as terrestrial radiation due to radionuclides in the soil or cosmic radiation originating in outer space. Although they can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminum, beta particles can penetrate the dead skin layer, potentially causing burns. They can pose a serious direct or external radiation threat and can be lethal depending on the amount received. They also pose a serious internal radiation threat if beta-emitting atoms are ingested or inhaled. See also alpha particle, gamma ray, neutron, x-ray. Bioassay: an assessment of radioactive materials that may be present inside a person’s body through analysis of the person’s blood, urine, feces, or sweat. Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) Reports: reports of the National Research Council’s committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. Biological half-life: the time required for one half of the amount of a substance, such as a radionuclide, to be expelled from the body by natural metabolic processes, not counting radioactive decay, once it has been taken in through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption. See also radioactive half-life, effective half-life. These, in turn, can be absorbed by other fissile nuclei, releasing still more neutrons. Its most common radioisotope, cobalt-60 (Co-60), is used in radiography and medical applications. Cobalt-60 emits beta particles and gamma rays during radioactive decay. Contamination (radioactive): the deposition of unwanted radioactive material on the surfaces of structures, areas, objects, or people where it may be external or internal. See also decontamination. See also background radiation, terrestrial radiation. Very large doses can result in permanent hair loss, scarring, altered skin color, deterioration of the affected body part, and death of the affected tissue (requiring surgery). The decay constant is inversely proportional to the radioactive half-life. Also known as “decay chain products” or “progeny” (the isotopes and elements). A decay product may be either radioactive or stable. Decay, radioactive: disintegration of the nucleus of an unstable atom by the release of radiation. See also enriched uranium. Reported as becquerels per square\n\n Naturally occurring actinium is composed of two radioactive isotopes; (from the radioactive family of ) and  (a granddaughter of ). decays mainly as a beta emitter with a very small energy, but in 1.38% of cases it emits an alpha particle, so it can readily be identified through alpha spectrometry. All remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 10 hours and the majority of them have half-lives shorter than one minute. Each radioactive isotope has a characteristic decay time period—the half-life—that is determined by the amount of time needed for half of a sample to decay. This is an exponential decay process that steadily decreases the proportion of the remaining isotope by 50% every half-life. Hence after two half-lives have passed only 25% of the isotope is present, and so forth. Alpha decay typically occurs in the heaviest nuclides. Exceptionally, however, beryllium-8 decays to two alpha particles. Alpha decay is \n\nThe substance with the largest half-life is radium. It has a very long half-life, which refers to the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay into a different element. Radium is commonly found in small quantities in the Earth's crust and is a decay product of uranium and thorium. It emits alpha, beta, and gamma radiation and is known for its ability to glow in the dark. It's important to note that due to its radioactivity, radium can present health risks if not handled properly. Exposure to high levels of radium can increase the risk of cancer and other health issues. Therefore, it is crucial to follow safety protocols and guidelines when working with or around radium.\n\nQuestion: Which radioactive substance sometimes occurs naturally in spring water?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In any ellipsoid, the length of a degree of longitude at the equator is thus exactly 60 geographical miles. The shape of the Earth is a slightly flattened sphere, which results in the Earth's circumference being 0.168% larger when measured around the equator as compared to through the poles. The figure Alfraganus used based on these measurements was 56 2/3 miles, giving an Earth circumference of 20400 mi. Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of 6371 km. Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357 km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378 km.

The Biosphere 2 Project\n\nFrom September 26, 1991 to September 26, 1993 a courageous group of eight men and women—including the late UCLA longevity researcher Roy Walford—set off on a path of ecological discovery in the Oracle, Arizona desert called the Biosphere 2 project. This visionary project lead to the creation of the largest artificial, self-sustaining ecosystem ever built and was truly a masterpiece of human engineering. For two years and twenty minutes, inside a completely sealed, glass-enclosed 3.15 acre environment—composed of miniature replicas of all the earth's environments, and housing 3,800 species of plants and animals, designed to function together as a single system—these eight people had to grow all their own vegetables, raise all their own livestock, and live so that a hundred percent of their waste was recycled.

Gypsum, which is a type of mineral, is commonly used as a component in dental investments due to its unique properties. As a mineral, gypsum has excellent heat resistance and stability when exposed to high temperatures during the casting process. It is worth noting that while gypsum is an essential component, the strength of dental investment also relies on other variables, such as the proportions of the different ingredients, the water-to-powder ratio, and the technique used in mixing and investing. Therefore, a proper balance of all these factors is crucial to achieve optimal strength in the dental investment for gold alloy. for mineral substrates such as mineral plasters and concrete.

It is widely mined and is used as a fertilizer and as the main constituent in many forms of plaster, blackboard/sidewalk chalk, and drywall. It forms as an evaporite mineral and as a hydration product of anhydrite. One of its primary uses is in the field of medicine for creating casts and dies. Gypsum is also utilized in dentistry for creating dental casts and dies. Gypsum dies, on the other hand, are used to produce precise and customized dental restorations, such as crowns and bridges. In addition to the medical and dental field, gypsum is used in various other industries. It is commonly used in construction for making plaster of Paris, which is a type of gypsum plaster used for wall and ceiling finishes. Furthermore, it has applications in the production of fertilizers, cement, and even as a filler in certain food and pharmaceutical products.

At experimental paradoxes, physicists modified the aether's hypothetical properties. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory. Besides the problems of the partial aether-dragging hypothesis, another major problem arose with the Michelson–Morley experiment (1887). In Fresnel's theory, the aether is almost stationary and the Earth is moving through it, so the experiment should have given a positive result. However, the result of this experiment was negative.

Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos. Fundamental to modern cosmology is the well-accepted theory of the Big Bang, wherein our Universe began at a single point in time, and thereafter expanded over the course of 13.8 billion years to its present condition. In the very early moments, it is theorized that the \n\n If the universe is just one of many, each with different physical constants, it would be unsurprising that we find ourselves in a universe hospitable to intelligent life (see multiverse: anthropic principle). As yet, there is no evidence for the existence of a multiverse, but some versions of the theory make predictions of which some researchers studying M-theory and gravity leaks hope to see some evidence soon. The theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of physical laws and the cosmological principle. The universality of physical laws is one of the underlying principles of the theory of relativity. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is homogeneous and isotropic—appearing the same in all directions regardless of location. These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but later efforts were made to test each of them. Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations. Michael Rowan-Robinson emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: \"It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe.\"\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the theory that the universe appears the same wherever and whenever viewed?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction. As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view. In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint. Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies. These clusters gradually disperse, and the stars join the population of the Milky Way. from the Galactic Center. calculate this zone to be a ring 7 to 9 kiloparsecs in radius, including no more than 10% of the stars in the Milky Way, about 20 to 40 billion stars. would halve these numbers; they estimate that at most 5% of stars in the Milky Way fall within the galactic habitable zone.

One possible consequence is that galaxies would no longer remain bound and would start to drift apart from each other. Additionally, the repulsion of gravity would affect the motion of celestial bodies. Furthermore, the formation of new structures in the universe, such as stars and galaxies, would be severely impacted. The behavior of celestial bodies, the arrangement of galaxies, and the formation of new structures would all be drastically altered.

The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. The upward contact force from the \n\nThe term \"theory of relativity\" refers to two theories formulated by Albert Einstein: special relativity and general relativity. These theories revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It introduces concepts like time dilation and length contraction. On the other hand, general relativity, presented by Einstein in 1915, extends the principles of special relativity to include gravitational forces. It describes gravity as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. It is important to note that while \"relativity\" primarily refers to these two theories by Einstein, there is also Galilean relativity, which predates them. Galilean relativity was developed by Galileo Galilei in the 17th century and describes how motion appears relative between observers in uniform motion. The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to highlight how special relativity (and later general relativity) utilizes the principle of relativity. This principle states that the laws of physics should hold true for all observers moving at constant velocities relative to each other. - The term \"theory of relativity\" was coined by Max Planck in 1908 to emphasize how special relativity (and later general relativity) uses the principle of rela\n\nQuestion: Which force is nothing more than the bending of space and time?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It is currently moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of −21 km/s, and will come within 44.58 pc in about 685,000 years ago. At the age of 2.4 billion years it has become a red clump giant, meaning it is generating energy through helium fusion at its core. Currently it is moving towards the Solar System at 41 km/s, which means in 2.35 million years it will pass at just 5.519 pc distance, probably becoming the brightest star in the night sky, at magnitude −2.1, for a period. This is giving the star an oblate shape with a prominent equatorial bulge that is estimated to be 21% larger than the polar radius. It is radiating 150 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 9,016 K.\n\n Psi Capricorni, Latinized from ψ Capricorni, is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Capricornus. The distance to this star is approximately 47.9 light years based on parallax measurements, and it is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +20 km/s.

South America is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east by the Atlantic Ocean. South America has an area of approximately 17,840,000 square kilometres (6,890,000 sq mi), or almost 3.5% of Earth's surface. South America ranks fourth among all continents in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). Nine countries have territory in the Amazon River basin or immediately adjoin this region: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana. The Andes extends from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. Both regions have many endemic species. Habitats in these two regions are very various and include Amazon rainforest, Atlantic forest, Llanos grasslands, Puna grassland and Valdivian temperate rain forest. The range is 6999. km long, 200. to 700. km wide (widest between 18°S - 20°S latitude), and has an average height of about 4000. m. The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Andes are the location of several high plateaus—some of which host major cities such as Quito, Bogotá, Cali, Arequipa, Medellín, Bucaramanga, Sucre, Mérida, El Alto and La Paz. The Altiplano plateau is the world's second-highest after the Tibetan plateau. It represents over half of the planet's rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60%, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.

This gas is lighter than air, which enables objects to float in air when filled with helium. This property makes helium useful for filling balloons and airships. It remains a gas, even at extremely low temperatures and high pressures. In terms of its chemical properties, helium is an unreactive element and is considered inert. It does not readily form compounds with other elements, which is why it is often referred to as a noble gas. These properties make it useful in various industries and applications, from balloons to scientific research. Argon is the third-most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, at 0.934% (9340 ppmv). It is more than twice as abundant as water vapor (which averages about 4000 ppmv, but varies greatly), 23 times as abundant as carbon dioxide (400 ppmv), and more than 500 times as abundant as neon (18 ppmv).

On presentation at Foster Hospital for Small Animals, Baci was found to have mildly icteric sclera. Heinz bodies are indicated by black arrows. Heinz bodies form following oxidation of hemoglobin sulfhydryl groups. In some cases Heinz bodies coalesce into a large pale intracellular inclusion that distorts the RBC membrane and projects to one side of the cell. Examination of RBCs near the feathered edge may be helpful, since RBCs in this area are more fully flattened out and membrane spicules are often lost, while Heinz bodies should still be visible. Heinz bodies also increase RBC rigidity, rendering them susceptible to entrapment in the spleen where they are phagocytized. In some cases, RBCs may contain several small Heinz bodies (rather than a single large one) and these are much more difficult to visualize in a Wright stained smear. Supravital stains, such as new methylene blue (NMB), as illustrated in Figure 4, can help to confirm the presence of Heinz bodies. Figure 4: Supravital stains, such as new methylene blue (NMB) can help to confirm the presence of Heinz bodies. In dogs, differentials include ingestion of food containing onions or garlic, chemicals (zinc pennies or naphthalene moth balls), skunk spray and drugs (vitamin K1 or acetaminophen). In cats, low numbers of small Heinz bodies can be an incidental finding. Increased numbers of, sometimes quite large, Heinz bodies are found in cats with diabetes mellitus (associated with ketone production), lymphoma and hyperthyroidism. Acetaminophen, propofol, onions, garlic, and benzocaine have also been associated with increased Heinz bodies in cats. A call to the owner revealed the fact that, about one week earlier, Baci had gotten into a cupboard and ingested a bottle of onion flakes. Heinz bodies/eccentrocytes may remain in the circulation for an extended period of time due to the dog’s long RBC lifespan (110-120 days).

From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each k-combination S strictly less than C, there is a unique index i such that ci is absent from S, while ck, ..., ci+1 are present in S, and no other value larger than ci is.

The PDC's World Grand Prix uses this format. The minimum number of thrown darts required to complete a leg of 501 is nine. The most common nine-dart finish consists of two 180 maximums followed by a 141 checkout (T20-T19-D12), but there are many other possible ways of achieving the feat. After any correct answer, the team may choose to throw rather than take another question, having three attempts to hit the highest value reached and deduct it from their total. A team must throw upon reaching either the 100-point level or a level greater than or equal to their current total, whichever comes first. Each team then has 45 seconds to throw darts and hit as many unlit targets in sequence as possible, starting directly above the last one lit on their side. After each of the first three rounds, the professionals face each other in a standard game of darts; the first to count down from 501 to zero wins, scoring 10 points for their team, and a double is required to close out.

Ascorbic acid is a naturally occurring organic compound with antioxidant properties. Ascorbic acid is one form of vitamin C. It dissolves well in water to make a mildly acidic solution. In pharmaceutical ascorbic acid is used to create Vitamin C supplements. Citric acid is a natural preservative which is present in citrus fruits. In the pharmaceutical industry, citric acid is widely used as a flavoring and stabilizing agent in pharmaceutical preparations. It is used to enhance fruit flavors and to import a desirable tart taste that helps mask medicinal flavors. Citric acid is used in syrups, elixirs, or combined with bicarbonates or carbonates in antacids and dentifrices. Also known as Potassium Bitartrate or Potassium Acid Tartrate; Cream of Tartar is a white crystal or powder and a byproduct of the winemaking process as it forms inside wine barrels during fermentation. It comes from tartaric acid, a naturally occurring substance in grapes and some other tart fruits. In the pharmaceutical industry, cream of tartar is used as a diuretic and a laxative besides being used extensively in the manufacture of toothpaste. As such it has an influence on nucleic acid syntheses, fat metabolism, conversion of carbohydrate to fat and metabolism of glycine, serine, methionine and chlorine. Fumaric acid is a common food acidulant included in many processed foods to keep them stable and to add tartness. Fumaric acid occurs naturally in fumitory, bolete mushrooms, lichen and Iceland moss.

It comes from tartaric acid, a naturally occurring substance in grapes and some other tart fruits. Also known as tri potassium citrate, potassium citrate is the potassium salt of citric acid, an organic acid naturally found in citrus fruit. It is a natural preservative and is also used to add an acidic (sour) taste to foods and soft drinks. It is a white salt that is very soluble in water and primarily used as a food preservative. Also known as Potassium sodium tartrate, Rochelle Salt is an odorless, colorless to white crystalline with a salty taste.

Sulfuric acid, a diprotic acid, is the most widely used acid in industry, which is also the most-produced industrial chemical in the world. It is mainly used in producing fertilizer, detergent, batteries and dyes, as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities. According to the statistics data in 2011, the annual production of sulfuric acid was around 200 million tonnes in the world. For example, nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling. the stomach and activates digestive enzymes), acetic acid (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), sulfuric acid (used in car batteries), and citric acid (found in citrus fruits).

Species like Rana palustris (pickerel frogs) fall between wood frogs and green frogs in terms of larval duration and size at metamorphosis. American toads and wood frogs tend to delay dispersal, allowing them to undergo rapid growth and development after metamorphosis. The smaller body sizes of newly metamorphosed toads and wood frogs impose limitations on their behaviors. Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with \n\n and is part of a genus that contains four of the world's ten smallest frog species. The largest frog is the African Goliath frog (Conraua goliath), which can reach 32 cm and weigh 3 kg. Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiological processes. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. This is in contrast to terrestrial amphibians, which rely on lungs for gas exchange. Secondly, larval and adult amphibians have different hemoglobin compositions. No globin chains are shared between larval and adult amphibians. Adult amphibians generally have higher hemoglobin concentrations and packed cell volumes (PCVs) compared to larval forms. Metamorphosis in newts and salamanders may not result in a transition in hemoglobin affinity like in frogs and toads. However, when newts and salamanders switch from aquatic to aerobic respiration at metamorphosis, both larval and adult hemoglobins exhibit the same affinity for oxygen. Lastly, toads, which primarily rely on aerobic respiration, tend to have higher hemoglobin and erythrocyte phosphate concentrations and lower blood oxygen affinity compared to frogs, which primarily rely on anaerobic respiration. These differences in oxygen transport mechanisms reflect the varying physiological adaptations amphibians undergo during their life cycle and their transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats.\n\nQuestion: What is the difference between a frog and a toad?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1973, Dr. Joseph Kerwin was the first U.S. physician selected for astronaut training, serving as the Science Pilot for the Skylab2 mission to the first U.S. orbital space station. Like Dr. Kerwin, when physicians have flown, they have served as scientists, engineers, spacewalkers, and project managers. Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata performs an ultrasound scan using the Human Research Facility (HRF) Ultrasound2 on Expedition 38. Surprisingly, few serious medical emergencies in space have been reported. While documented conditions have included urosepsis, renal colic, cellulitis, pneumonitis, and cardiac arrhythmia, only 17 of these nonfatal severe medical events have been reported during spaceflight between 1961-1999.1 The relatively benign nature of medical problems in space flight is likely due to shorter missions, selection of healthy astronauts, on-board medications, and countermeasures to environmental effects and prolonged microgravity.2 The comprehensive profiling process includes an evaluation of astronauts' physiological and psychosocial well-being, medical history, and extensive laboratory and genetic markers. Mae Jemison, MD, (a general practitioner) floats in zero gravity at the Spacelab Japan Science module aboard STS-105, Endeavour. For example, one study estimates that the risk of an emergency medical event during a 7-member space flight to Mars would be about 1 emergency event per trip. This may seem negligible until put in the context of a 6-month return to Earth.1,3 Thus, the capability to administer advanced care for illness and injury will undoubtedly be a prerequisite for interplanetary travel and prolonged human spaceflight beyond low Earth orbit.2 Additionally, as space vehicles move further from Earth's orbit, telemetric medical support and traditional communication traveling at the speed of light will have a longer delay (eg, in the case of Mars, two-way radio contact will require a minimum of 44 minutes).2 Given such delays, the current practice of relying on Earth-based medical consultation and a crew medical officer without extensive medical training may no longer be enough. Other medical events unique to space also must be anticipated, particularly higher incidence of space radiation, injuries from increased extravehicular activities, space debris, and increased susceptibility for infection. Astronaut Luca Parmitano collects fundoscopic images with the help of astronaut Chris Cassidy for the Ocular Health experiment. Future space travelers are unlikely to be as fit and healthy as past astronauts, adding to the likelihood of increased medical incidents in space. Despite these restrictions, the space tourist will be less healthy and less equipped to handle emergencies than previous space travelers who spent years preparing for a mission. Only 5 EM-trained American physician-astronauts have flown in space: Thomas Marshburn, MD; Anna Fisher, MD; William Hendrick Fisher, MD; Scott Parazynski, MD; and Kjell Lindgren, MD.4 The emergency medicine training experience has many qualities that make emergency physicians the best potential medical providers for the future of human space flight: comfort with rapid assessment and treatment, resuscitation expertise, ability to perform a wide range of advanced procedures, exposure to diverse pathologies, and creativity in resource limited settings.

From psychologist of the Rehabilitation Unit \"Thalpos Kalamata\" Evi Tsikrikou. \"Children's conceptions of medical procedures\". There are many different aspects that belong to this range of fear (F40.23, ICD 10). “Iatrophobia” or else the fear of doctors is a phobia very common in young children but also in adults. Needles, vaccines and pain are directly associated with doctors. The possibility to listen anything negative, regarding their health, terrifies them so much that they persuade themselves that they are not at risk. A suffered person may have had a traumatic experience with a physician as a child and this is how this phobia was born to him. Several individuals who suffer from iatrophobia, face troubles with doctors as they are experts in medical field and for this they feel dislike or fear for them. Medical films, news about malicious surgery or medical bribery can also create negative images that lead to iatrophobia. It is difficult to overcome iatrophobia as most people refuse to visit even the specialist who would help them deal with it. A psychologist would assist the patient in managing his anxiety by various techniques such as controlled breathing. In more serious cases, a combination of drugs and psychotherapy, it is proved to be of valuable help. From doctor's point of view, discussing the phobia with the patient is an important element. It is observed that music or television during the examination contribute positively. It is also important that the patient is not ashamed to discuss with the doctor his phobia, reminding himself that the doctor is the key to deal with his fear. As such, this is a pretty intense phase, so we have to be on the lookout for low numbers. Earlier in this phase he needed a blood transfusion because of low hemoglobin. If he doesn’t, we’ll be both grateful and surprised. Harrison and Blakely. Harrison’s nearly life-ending stroke is an example of how the treatment kills kids before achieving remission. So oncologists learned that cancer is good at hiding in sanctuary sites such as the brain and testes. The second fear is infection. Because these kids are immuno-suppressed, they are susceptible to each and every disease. When you read about kids dying from influenza, for example, you can be sure that many of those are cancer kids. Another fear is the treatment itself. In the short term kids might have a stroke, they might have an allergic reaction, they might have neuropthy, they might suffer cardiac arrest. In the long term these kids lose some cognitive capacity, have organ damage, face sterility, and are psychologically scarred by the terrible experience. Every day and night parents of cancer kids wonder what side effects their child will suffer, not if their child will suffer them. For us, these fears, and a thousand others, are all real. We cannot imagine them away. We wake up in the middle of the night and race to see if our child is breathing (like all parents do with their first child). Our hearts stop beating every time the phone rings, afraid the doctor might be calling with more bad news. We jump at every cough, sneeze, or headache. 73). He gives us a peace that smooths the sharp edges of our fears. He gives us the presence of his people as a place of refuge and comfort. He gives us his common grace in the wisdom and expertise of the doctors, nurses, and researchers. While we have all the fears enumerated above, he has one fear and one fear only: medicine. I cannot imagine the fear that you live with when it is your child. I am so thankful that my God was great and good and merciful, and that HE supplied me with the strength to fight my disease. God has a purpose for this, and he will discover that purpose as he walks through this trial. Steven, you and Ginger need lots of support and love. That is very common, but don’t harbor that because if you do it will eat you alive, let it out. They are precious children, and they are terrified of losing their brother. You are a very bright young man, but I just felt a need to remind you. Steven, would do anything to help if I could make Harrison better. \"A doctor will most likely ask a number of questions to understand all the symptoms one may be experiencing, and will also perform a physical examination.

The palpitations would start as soon as he got into a crowd or a narrow street. He dreaded railway stations and malls for \"fear of suffocation.\" On detailed analysis, we found Binay was an extremely anxious person; his anxiety would escalate if he had to reach somewhere at a given time. Based on his sense of fear and anticipatory anxiety, we prescribed him _Argentum Nitricum_. His anxiety and fear no longer troubled him. * * *\n\nExpert's View:\n\nPhobias often play havoc in the lives of those suffering from them.Instead of treating them with anti-anxiety medicines, it is better to use a safe homeopathic remedy for specific phobias.Self-Help\n\n  * Don't panic when you see a 'fearful' situation, or object. Thanks for the great question. You describe a number of fears that may be related to sensory sensitivities. Instead, he may show his fear with extreme avoidance of a situation. For example, he might refuse to go to school after a fire drill. He might become fearful of birthday parties after being frightened by a balloon that popped unexpectedly. Many parents go to great pains to protect their children by avoiding agitating situations. This approach is sometimes appropriate and even necessary. I suggest making a list of your child’s major fears and worries. To encourage success, I’d start with a mild-to-moderate fear before taking on his extreme reaction to loud noises. For example, you can teach your son to take deep slow breaths to help manage his body’s physical anxiety reactions. Or you might try watching a video of a balloon pop – perhaps with the volume off the first time. Then he can watch a real balloon pop while standing some distance away. Over time, he can move closer and closer to the balloon. After such exercises, you can present him with small rewards for being brave and “facing fears.” Remember that even a small act of bravery – such as listening to a recording of thunder for 10 seconds – represents an important step toward handling fears. It deserves to be acknowledged. Although graded exposure may seem counterintuitive, research indicates that this strategy is the single most effective strategy for getting over a particular fear. Are there effective treatments? Also known as the irrational fear of the dark, nyctophobia can cause someone to avoid dark places. It still remains as one of the most common fears of children. Published by Hypnosis in London on 26 September 2016, written by Malminder Gill. Many children are afraid of the dark. In fact, it is estimated that about 90% of children have this kind of fear. The intense fear of the dark can be brought about by distressing or traumatizing events that are related with darkness. A person with nyctophobia may have experienced as a child being punished or abused in a dark room. These distressing events can instill bad memories with night or darkness. Those who are not able to overcome this fear may grow up as adults bringing along this fear. They may also have thoughts of dying or feeling dread. Like other people with phobia, those with nyctophobia know that their fear is irrational but feel like they can’t do something about it. They feel powerless in overcoming their fear and a sense of impending doom usually prevails them. However, this can be overcome through different forms of therapy. In order to be effective, the psychotherapist must address the specific anxiety of the person. For phobias like nyctophobia, CBT can be a combination of cognitive therapy and exposure therapy. It remains to be an undisputed treatment for anxiety disorders like phobias. Through hypnosis, the response of the person can be studied. It can also point out situations or thoughts that provoke such reaction. This then can be brought to one’s consciousness and be used in highly-stressful situations. Through guided hypnosis, I was able to help clients suffering from different kinds of phobia. Initially, I would be talking to the client to discuss the issue and finding out the possible root cause. The next step would be to prepare the hypnosis session based on the conversation. On the last session of hypnotherapy, it would be about tying loose ends.

Additionally, acrophobia can also cause physiological symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, and a sense of impending doom or panic attack. Traumatic experiences or accidents involving heights can contribute to the development of this phobia. Treatment for acrophobia often includes a combination of therapy techniques. In conclusion, acrophobia is an intense and irrational fear of heights that can significantly impact a person's life. It is treatable through various therapy techniques, including cognitive-behavioral therapy and exposure therapy.

It is a specific phobia that can cause significant distress and impair an individual's daily functioning. People with thanatophobia often have an overwhelming fear of their own death or the death of loved ones. This fear may be triggered by thoughts of dying, witnessing death, or being in situations related to mortality, such as hospitals or funerals. Symptoms of thanatophobia can vary from person to person but may include extreme anxiety, panic attacks, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, sweating, trembling, nausea, and a sense of impending doom. Traumatic experiences, such as the loss of a loved one or a near-death experience, may also contribute to the development of this phobia. They can offer a personalized treatment approach and support to address the impact of thanatophobia on an individual's life.\n\nQuestion: Taphephobia is the fear of losing your teeth?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In 1897, the German chemist Felix Hoffmann succeeded in synthesizing a more tolerable derivative, acetylsalicylic acid. Interestingly, the Karolinska Institute did not mention this achievement. One could consider to include three other Nobel Prizes. Emil von Behring’s serum therapy, however, for which he was awarded with the first Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901, was a vaccination. And the discovery of insulin, which earned Frederick Banting and John Macleod the Nobel Prize in 1923, surely was a fundamental therapeutic breakthrough. In contrast, an almost countless number of Nobel Prizes in all three scientific disciplines has been awarded for inventions and discoveries of methods, structures and pathways that facilitated the identification of drug targets and the search for new drugs. The importance of this tool is mainly reflected in the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1978 to Werner Arber, Daniel Nathans and Hamilton Smith \"for the discovery of restriction enzymes and their application to problems of molecular genetics\", and in the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1980 to Paul Berg \"for his fundamental studies of the biochemistry of nucleic acids, with particular regard to recombinant-DNA\" and to Walter Gilbert and Frederick Sanger \"for their contributions concerning the determination of base sequences in nucleic acids\". In Physiology or Medicine alone, 17 Nobel Prizes (1933, 1946, 1958, 1959, 1962, 1965, 1968, 1975, 1978, 1983, 1993, 1995, 2002, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012) are associated with the preparation and further progress of gene technology, ranging from „discoveries concerning the role played by the chromosome in heredity“ (Thomas Morgan 1933) to “the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become pluripotent\" (Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka 2012), among them the Nobel Prize to Crick, Watson and Wilkins for unraveling the double helix structure of DNA (1962). The Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine 1971 (to Earl Sutherland who discovered the second messenger cAMP), 1994 (to Alfred Gilman and Martin Rodbell who discovered G-proteins and explained their role in signal transduction) and 2012 (to Robert Lefkovitz and Brian Kobilka who solved the structure of GPCRs) underline that significance. “This period, the last three decades, is known and will remain known as the golden age\n\n Alfred Bernhard Nobel (, ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development. Nobel displayed an early aptitude for science and learning, particularly in chemistry and languages; he became fluent in six languages and filed his first patent at age 24. He embarked on many business ventures with \n\n , born on 21 October 1833 in Stockholm Sweden, was a chemist, engineer, innovator, armaments manufacturer and the inventor of dynamite. Nobel held 355 different patents, dynamite being the most famous. Nobel amassed a sizeable personal fortune during his lifetime, thanks mostly to this invention. In 1896 Nobel died of a stroke in his villa in San Remo, Italy where he had lived out the last years of his life.

On 3 September 1864, a shed used for preparation of nitroglycerin exploded at the factory in Heleneborg, Stockholm, Sweden, killing five people, including Nobel's younger brother Emil. Fazed by the accident, Nobel founded the company Nitroglycerin Aktiebolaget AB in Vinterviken so that he could continue to work in a more isolated area. Nobel invented dynamite in 1867, a substance easier and safer to handle than the more unstable nitroglycerin. Dynamite was patented in the US and the UK and was used extensively in mining and the building of transport networks internationally. In 1875, Nobel invented gelignite, more stable and powerful \n\nThe Nobel Prize has significant importance in the field of medicine as it recognizes individuals or groups that have made outstanding contributions to medical research and advancements. Established by Alfred Nobel, the Nobel Prize rewards achievements that have had a substantial impact on the understanding, prevention, and treatment of diseases. Additionally, the Nobel Prize has a significant impact on public perception and awareness of medical advancements. It inspires future generations, promotes scientific collaboration, and raises public awareness of the importance of medical advancements.\n\nQuestion: The invention of what in 1867, made Alfred Nobel famous?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Prior to the standardization in English of the letter 'J', the letter 'I' was used interchangeably; following this shift, forms beginning in J- such as John began to be pronounced in their modern fashion with rather than  (y). Since then, it has been spelled in its current form, John. The feminine form changed from Jehanne to Joanne, Joan and Jo. The Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound (acrophony), continue to be used to varying degrees in Samaritan, Aramaic, Syriac, Hebrew, Greek and Arabic. The names were abandoned in Latin, which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were Y and Z, which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as Y Graeca \"Greek Y\" (pronounced I Graeca \"Greek I\") and zeta (from Greek)—this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term zed for Z in all forms of English other than American English.

In Major League Baseball, until his retirement in 2016, Vin Scully continued the practice; however, he simulcast only the first three innings of Los Angeles Dodgers games at Dodger Stadium and other National League Western Division parks. In the United States, a last-minute deal was reached between the league and its longtime American syndicator America One, which carried two games each week. On September7, 1979, at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time, an estimated 30,000 viewers tuned in to witness the launch of ESPN. Simultaneously, ESPN debuted its first SportsCenter telecast with anchors Lee Leonard and George Grande. The first words spoken were from Leonard who informed viewers: \"If you're a fan, if you're a fan, what you'll see in the next minutes, hours, and days to follow may convince you you've gone to sports heaven.\" Estimates are that the broadcast reached approximately 1,000 television sets. The game came just one month after the Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Cincinnati Reds in the first-ever televised professional baseball game, and five months after the Princeton and Columbia baseball teams played the first televised sporting event. Sports broadcasting continued. On February 28, 1940, the University of Pittsburgh played Fordham at Madison Square Garden in the first televised basketball game. The practice was common in the early years of television, but since the 1980s, most teams have used a separate team for television and for radio. As all NFL television broadcasts are done by the national networks or via cable, there are no regular TV-to-radio football simulcasts.\n\nQuestion: In 1931, what became the first ever televised sports event?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Metro's Jon O’Brien concluded that: \"From its lyrical themes of female solidarity to its insanely catchy pop hooks and mischief-making promo, the worldwide chart-topper encapsulated everything that made the group so spellbinding in the space of just two minutes and 52 seconds.\" Responding to the wave of public interest in the group, Virgin released the song as the group's debut single in the United Kingdom in July 1996, well ahead of the planned release date of the Spice album.\n\nQuestion: What was the Spice Girls' debut single called?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Flat is the opposite of sharp, which is a raising of pitch. In musical notation, flat means \"lower in pitch by one semitone (half step)\", notated using the symbol which is derived from a stylised lowercase 'b'. To allow extended just intonation, composer Ben Johnston uses a sharp as an accidental to indicate a note is raised 70.6 cents (ratio 25:24), and a flat to indicate a note is lowered 70.6 cents. In intonation, flat can also mean \"slightly lower in pitch\" (by some unspecified amount). If two simultaneous notes are slightly out-of-tune, the lower-pitched one (assuming the higher one is properly pitched) is \"flat\" with respect to the other. temperament system. Twelve equal-temperament fifths lead to a note exactly seven octaves above the initial tone—this results in a perfect fifth that is equivalent to seven equal-temperament semitones. Similarly, proceeding counterclockwise from the top of the circle, the notes change by descending fifths and the key signatures change accordingly: the key of F has one flat, the key of B has 2 flats, and so \n\n  Common-tone modulation uses a sustained or repeated pitch from the old key as a bridge between it and the new key (common tone). This is used, for example, in Schubert's Unfinished Symphony. If only one or two of the notes are common, then we call it common tone modulation.\" The medieval conception of the tetrachordal structure, however, was based on one single tetrachord, that of the D scale, each formed of a semitone between tones, T–S–T.\n\nQuestion: What are the only two musical notes which have no flats?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

French fries, called Pommes frites, Pommes (spoken as \"Pom fritz\" or, respectively, \"Pommes\", deviating from the French pronunciation which would be \"Pom freet\" or \"Pom\") or regionally as Fritten in German, are a common style of fried potatoes; they are traditionally offered with either ketchup or mayonnaise, or, as Pommes rot/weiß (lit. fries red/white), with both. Also common are dumplings (including Klöße as the term in the north or Knödel as the term in the south) and in southern Germany potato noodles, including Schupfnudeln, which are similar to Italian gnocchi. The thick-cut fries are called Pommes Pont-Neuf or simply pommes frites (about 10 mm); thinner variants are pommes allumettes (matchstick potatoes; about 7 mm), and pommes paille (potato straws; 3–4 mm). Pommes gaufrettes are waffle fries. A popular dish in France is steak frites, which is steak accompanied by thin french fries. French fries migrated to the German-speaking countries during the 19th century. In Germany, they are usually known by the French words pommes frites, or only Pommes or Fritten (derived from the French words, but pronounced as German words).

This can lead to jumping to conclusions and picking the less efficient modality for treatment. Your conclusion should be based on a thorough evaluation, which should involve assessments looking at muscle length, range of motion, manual muscle test to see if you can reproduce the pain, and of course palpation of the area to see if there is an active trigger point or just a tender point. The client was a female in her late 50s. She had a MRI of her back. Here is why listening is really an important assessment tool—her health history revealed that two years ago she had stepped into a small hole while on a downhill hike, at which time she landed on her right knee. She didn't notice anything initially, however after returning from the trip she started a spinning program to try and gain some strength in her legs. She had been instructed to use the foam roller to roll the knot out that was causing the pain. I had her point to where she felt the pain start. She pointed to the mid-section of the rectus femoris. On palpation of the area it was confirmed, any pressure over this area would reproduce her symptoms. As described by her it started in one area and then would become so diffused that she had to stop her activity. All of the good things she was trying to do for herself were putting too much compressive forces on the already injured tissue. I chose these treatment modalities based on the thought of the compressive forces being placed on the trigger point deep and underneath rectus femoris. Think of this like needing to fluff up a pillow so it is not so hard to sleep on. I did not stretch her quadriceps to avoid compression of the trigger point. Her homework was to discontinue the foam rolling (for now), stretching, and spinning. Looking for the 100 percent resolve, I took her to the training room to try and reproduce the trigger point. Within two minutes on the treadmill her symptoms started. She walked four more minutes before the trigger point began, we repeated the isometric. Next I took her to the bike. We stopped and I used a manual cup over the area and performed the isometric hold. I also told her she might need to keep doing the isometric's during her different activities if it reoccurred. I am extremely happy to report she has resumed normal activities with no pain or fatigue. The operative has a degree of control over the timing of these two latter tasks- and throughout the shift would try and balance the timing so roving bobbins did not all run out together, producing a smoother and less stressful work flow. Ellen complained to her mother that she couldn't do this and couldn't 'keep all her ends up'. Ellen responded to the pressures by absconding, Mary responding by thinking Ellen was a bad child.

Surprised, the woman turns the light back on and the silhouette vanishes. Switching the light off and on, she watches the silhouette appear and disappear, stopping when the silhouette suddenly moves so close it is inches away from her face. Gasping, she turns the light back on and tapes the switch in that position to prevent the silhouette from returning.

Her physical symptoms were also Water-related; in addition to lupus and chronic urinary tract infections, she had a history of lower back pain and stiffness, especially in the mornings and after exertion, and extreme fatigue in the late afternoon (Water's hours). I also noted an affinity to Fire in her history of panic attacks and heart palpitations, her tendency to become agitated and anxious when she was stressed, and her exceptionally serious demeanor (indicating a deficiency in Fire). When I tried to get her to laugh by telling a joke, she became very cross with me. \"Please—can't you help me?\" As Mary talked about her problems, she expressed a long-standing hatred for winter, explaining that her lupus symptoms often intensified during the winter months, when she suffered from mood swings and periodic bouts of depression as well.

Houses commonly have only one or two floors. Buildings are often classified as low-rise, mid-rise and high-rise according to how many levels they contain, but these categories are not well-defined. The tallest skyscraper in the world, Burj Khalifa, has 163 floors. The height of each storey is based on the ceiling height of the rooms plus the thickness of the floors between each pane.

In 19th-century London, many buildings were built with the main entrance floor a metre above ground, and the floor below that being two metres below ground. This was done partly for aesthetics, and partly to allow access between the lower level and the street without going through the main floor. In this situation, the lower level is called Lower Ground, the main floor is called Upper Ground, and floors above it are numbered serially from 1.

If it is a rainy day, he gets into the elevator in the morning, goes down to the ground floor and goes off to work. In the afternoon when he comes home, he gets into the elevator and goes straight to the 20th floor.

The name of the football club derives from St. John's Toun – the old name of Perth. Although it is officially recorded as being formed in 1884, the club did not play its first game until February 1885. There was also a suggestion that it was the club's clearly Nationalist stance as they pushed for membership of what was considered a predominantly Unionist league that stood in their way.

Both Sisaket and Surin had Khmer-speaking percentages of over 25.0% in both 1990 and 2000, with Surin even having a Khmer-speaking majority of over 60.0% in 1990, albeit with it falling just short of a Khmer-speaking majority in 2000. Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat all had Malay-speaking majorities of over 60.0% in both 1990 and 2000 but no other Thai province actually had anything close to a Malay-speaking majority in either of these two Thai census years. The first provinces were named mueang (เมือง, township) as those developed from the historical city-states. There were both mueang directly dependent from Bangkok (thus similar to the modern province), as well as mueang under the supervision of a more powerful neighbouring mueang, or part of the semi-independent tributary states. In 1906 the transition to the term changwat started, which was finalised in 1916. For instance, no Thai province had a Burmese- and Peguan-speaking minority of 5.0% or more in 1990, though Ranong&ndash;located on the southern edge of Thailand's border with Burma&ndash;did have a Burmese- and Peguan-speaking minority of 7.0% in 2000, higher than any other Thai province for that year and also a huge increase from 1990, when the size of its Burmese- and Peguan-speaking minority was just 2.43%.\n\nQuestion: Which Asian country was once called Siam?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

While Luxembourgers are fluent in all three of their official languages, German, French and Luxembourgish, most also have a good working knowledge of English. Moutfort (French) (Mutfert, Mutfort) is a village in the commune of Contern, in south-western Luxembourg, on both sides of the road from the city of Luxembourg to the German border town Remich. This very great mixture of nationalities is due to the proximity of the commune of Contern to the city of Luxembourg, which is reachable by car in 10 minutes. Common economic problems arising from drastic changes in the industrial and coal mining areas of the four countries have led to the creation of a community of interest and to the development of common projects like the European Development Pole in the cross-border area of Longwy in France, Rodange in Luxembourg and Athus in Belgium. The European center situated between the rivers Saar, Moselle and Meuse presents the highest number and density of cross-border commuters in the European Union. Luxembourg and the Saarland both have a net in-flow of cross-border commuters. However, that of Luxembourg is constantly high, while that of the Saarland is continuously diminishing. The government of Luxembourg aimed to avoid this by re-affirming the country's neutrality. On the outbreak of war with its eastern neighbour, Germany put the Schlieffen Plan into action, and Luxembourg's government's fears were realised. Initially, Luxembourg was only a transit point for Albrecht von Württemberg's Fourth Army. One of the railways from the northern Rhineland into France passed through Troisvierges, in the far north of Luxembourg, and Germany's first infringement of Luxembourg's sovereignty and neutrality was the unauthorised use of Troisvierges station.\n\nQuestion: Which three countries does Luxembourg border?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Members of the group who listened to words sung to them recalled an average of 20% more words after listening to and recalling an interference list than members of the control group who listened to the same words spoken. This difference persisted, though slightly smaller (17%) when participants recalled words after a 15-min waiting period. Additionally, group participants who listened to words sung demonstrated a higher incidence of words recalled in correct serial order. Despite the widespread use of this technique for teaching information such as the alphabet and for students in higher education to memorize complex material (Cirigliano, 2013), there is little research on the use of musical mnemonics. As meaning is often derived from the serial presentation of information, an important consideration in memory research is serial location and order. In their study with 5 year olds, telephone numbers were presented either spoken or sung using a familiar melody. Study participants in the sung condition required significantly fewer trials to learn the target telephone number. Wallace (1994) conducted experiments comparing spoken text vs. sung text and found greater recall when text was presented using the rhythm and melody. Interestingly, when a line of text was sung only once, or if different melodies were used with each repetition of text, then spoken text enabled/led to improved recall. To understand the effects of musical templates on children with learning disabilities, Claussen and Thaut (1997) presented multiplication tables in spoken or sung forms. As in earlier trials, participants receiving the sung condition outperformed their peers who heard the spoken presentation of multiplication tables. This study also found increased bilateral synchronization of the prefrontal cortices in participants who heard the word lists sung compared to those who heard the lists spoken.

Zipf's law, described as an \"empirical statistical law\" of linguistics, is another example. According to the \"law\", given some dataset of text, the frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its frequency rank.

As people process the first character of the word, they make a mental prediction of what the word is before reading the rest of the characters. If the character and other preprocessing information indicates that the word is short and familiar, the reader is more likely to skip the entire word. The character frequency may be more important when reading than the frequency of the word as a whole.

The femur bone is the longest bone in the body, extending from the knee to the hip. At the top of the femur bone is the greater trochanter, that boney knob that people often refer to as their hip, and the bulbous \"femoral head\" which makes contact with the pelvis and forms the ball of the ball and socket joint. The femoral head fits into the acetabulum, the round socket of the pelvic bone. Both the femoral head and the acetabulum are lined with articular cartilage. When the femoral head rotates in the acetabulum, the articular cartilage allows the two surfaces to glide against each other. A strong piece of cartilage, called the labrum, rings the outer edge of the acetabulum. The labrum deepens the socket joint, making the joint more stable, but its elasticity allows for flexibility. Over time the smooth articular cartilage that makes up the surfaces of the hip joint may be damaged or blemished by normal wear and tear or from trauma. The hip has several ligaments connecting the femur to the pelvis and tendons connecting the bones to many surrounding muscles. Strong and flexible ligaments and tendons provide structure to the hip, reducing strain on the joint, so most hip osteoarthritis therapies will including stretching and strengthening of these structures. When the hip is at rest, the synovial fluid is stored in the cartilage, much like water in a sponge. When the hip rotates or bears weight the synovial fluid is squeezed out. Small sacs of synovial fluid, called bursae (singular is \"bursa\") surround all major joints, including the hip joint. When the hip joint becomes inflamed and painful, the pain may be felt in the groin but may also be referred into the back, buttocks and down the front or back of the leg. The hip joint must be able to accommodate these extreme forces repeatedly during intense physical exercise.The femur may also circumduct about 90 degrees around its axis at the hip joint.As well as this strength, the hip joint still enjoys a large range of motion, with its ball-and-socket structure allowing free movement of the femur through 360 degrees.This cartilage provides a smooth surface for the moving bones to glide across each other, as well as acting as a flexible shock absorber to prevent the collision of the bones during movement. The three main ligaments involved are the iliofemoral, pubofemoral, and ischiofemoral. It is also important to understand that the femur does not run down the middle of the thigh in a proximal to distal direction. At the hip the left and right femoral heads are separated by the width of the pelvis, whereas at the knee the two lower ends are almost touching. The shaft of the femur is therefore very oblique and is more pronounced in a female because of the wider pelvis. At the distal end of the femur, two rounded condyles meet the tibia and fibula bones of the lower leg, to form the knee joint. As well as this strength, the hip joint still enjoys a large range of motion, with its ball-and-socket structure allowing free movement of the femur through 360 degrees. The hip joint must be able to accommodate these extreme forces repeatedly during intense physical exercise.Gluteus maximus arises from the ilium, the sacrotuberous ligament, and the posterior aspects of the sacrum and coccyx; its deeper fibers pass obliquely downward and forward, to attach to the gluteal tuberosity on the posterior surface of the femur. In human anatomy, the thigh is the area between the hip (pelvis) and the knee. The single bone in the thigh is called the femur. This bone is very thick and strong (due to the high proportion of bone tissue), and forms a ball and socket joint at the hip, and a modified hinge joint at the knee. The distal end of the femur, or thigh bone, has several important features that contribute to its function in the skeletal structure. The angled neck of the femur allows for efficient weight-bearing and distribution of forces during movements such as walking or running. The trochanter serves as an attachment point for various muscles of the hip, including the gluteal muscles. The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body and is embedded in the quadriceps femoris tendon.At its distal end, its major weight-bearing articulation is with the tibia, but it also articulates anteriorly with the patella (knee cap).The femur is the bone of the thigh.The large ball and socket joint between these two bones is the hip joint.6.8).The organization of ligaments at the hip and knee joints, together with the shape of the articular surfaces, particularly at the knee, facilitates “locking” of these joints into position when standing, thereby reducing the muscular energy required to maintain a standing position. The bones of the gluteal region and the thigh are the pelvic bone and the femur (Fig. The large ball and socket joint between these two bones is the hip joint. The femur is the bone of the thigh. The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body and is embedded in the quadriceps femoris tendon.Although the main movements at the knee are flexion and extension, the knee joint also allows the femur to rotate on the tibia.This rotation contributes to “locking” of the knee when fully extended, particularly when standing.The leg contains two bones:\n\nThe tibia is medial in position, is larger than the laterally positioned fibula, and is the weight-bearing bone.\n\nQuestion: More commonly known as the thigh bone, what is the medical name for the longest bone in the human body?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The supporting hand may require slight adjustments. Studies have shown that most people, regardless of handedness, use their dominant hand for tasks that require accuracy. This means that anaesthetists, who often need to perform precise actions during procedures, should prioritize using their dominant hand. In a study conducted in Korea, it was found that only 6% of participants were left-handed and 8% were ambidextrous.

The human hands serve several important functions. They are the primary organs for physically manipulating the environment, allowing us to perform a wide range of tasks with varying levels of precision. From wielding a club to threading a needle, our hands enable us to engage in both rough motor skills and fine motor skills. One crucial function of the hands is their ability to provide tactile feedback. The fingertips contain a high concentration of nerve endings, making them incredibly sensitive to touch. In terms of handedness, each hand is predominantly controlled by the opposite hemisphere of the brain. This means that individuals have a preferred hand choice for single-handed activities like writing or using utensils. Handedness is determined by genetic factors and reflects an individual trait. It's important to note that while handedness is common, it is not universal. Some individuals may be ambidextrous, meaning they can use both hands equally well for various tasks. Overall, the human hands play a vital role in our daily lives by enabling us to interact with our environment and experience the world through touch.\n\nQuestion: What word is used to describe someone who is neither left or right handed, but can use both hands with equal ease?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Jeter wrote three authorized Blade Runner novels that continue Rick Deckard's story, attempting to resolve the differences between the film and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? These are Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (1995), Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night (1996), and Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon (2000) Blade Runner cowriter David Peoples wrote the 1998 action film Soldier, which he referred to as a \"sidequel\" or spiritual successor to the original film; the two are set in a shared universe. A bonus feature on the Blu-ray for Prometheus, the 2012 film by Scott set in the Alien universe, states that Eldon Tyrell, CEO of the Blade Runner Tyrell Corporation, was the mentor of Guy Pearce's character Peter Weyland. In the novel Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human (written by K. W. Jeter after Dick's death, incorporating elements from Do Androids Dream and Blade Runner script), Batty is one of a series of replicants based on a mercenary of the same name. The template suffered from \"neural malformation\", which made them unable to experience fear. The film Blade Runner (1982)—adapted from Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?—is set in 2019 in a dystopian future in which manufactured beings called replicants are slaves used on space colonies and are legal prey on Earth to various bounty hunters who \"retire\" (kill) them.

She appeared in the television role of Chrissy Snow on Three's Company and as Carol Foster Lambert on Step by Step. Somers married Bruce Somers in 1965, when she was 19, and they had a son, Bruce Jr., in November 1965. Somers became a prize model on Anniversary Game (1969–70), where she met host Alan Hamel. Career Early acting roles Somers began acting in small roles during the late 1960s and early 1970s (including on various talk shows promoting her book of poetry, and bit parts in movies, such as the \"Blonde in the white Thunderbird\" in American Graffiti, and an episode of the American version of the sitcom Lotsa Luck (as the femme fatale) in the early 1970s. She also appeared in The Rockford Files in 1974 and had an uncredited role as a topless \"pool girl\" in Magnum Force in 1973. She also had a guest-starring role on The Six Million Dollar Man, in the 1977 episode \"Cheshire Project,” she played a passenger on the first episode of The Love Boat as well as a guest appearance in a 1976 episode of One Day at a Time. She later landed her most famous role of the ditzy blonde \"Chrissy Snow\" on the ABC sitcom Three's Company in 1977. Also that year, she was a celebrity panelist on Match Game, and appeared with husband Alan Hamel on Tattletales. After actresses Suzanne Zenor and Susan Lanier did not impress producers during the first two test pilots, Somers was suggested by ABC president Fred Silverman, who had seen her on the Tonight Show and she was auditioned and hired the day before the taping of the third and final pilot officially commenced. The series co-starred John Ritter and Joyce DeWitt in a comedy of errors about two single women living with a single man who pretends to be gay in order to bypass the landlord's policy prohibiting single men sharing an apartment with single women. The program was an instant success in the ratings, eventually spawning a short-lived spin-off series (starring Norman Fell and Audra Lindley). When Three's Company began its fifth season in late 1980, Somers demanded a hefty salary increase from $30,000 to $150,000 an episode and 10 percent ownership of the show's profits. Somers says she was fired for asking to be paid as much as popular male television stars of the day such as Alan Alda and Carroll O'Connor. In 1983, Suzanne Somers through her Hamel/Somers Productions had signed a deal with Columbia Pictures Television. Somers and her Three's Company co-star John Ritter reconciled their friendship after 20 years of not speaking to each other, shortly before Ritter's death in 2003. Her first set of nude photos was taken by Stan Malinowski in February 1970 when Somers was a struggling model and actress and did a test photoshoot for the magazine. During an appearance on The Tonight Show, she denied ever posing nude (except for a High Society topless photo), which prompted Playboy to publish photos from the 1970 Malinowski shoot a decade later, in 1980. The second nude pictorial by Richard Fegley appeared in December 1984 in an attempt by Somers to regain her diminished popularity after the Three's Company debacle in 1981.

The series drew heavily on the same discredited Masonic/Royal Family conspiracy theory as the 1978 film Murder By Decree; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film From Hell.

The incarnation of Batman in the film is different from the character's previous portrayal in The Dark Knight Trilogy, serving as a cinematic reboot of the character. Keaton later reprised the role for the sequel Batman Returns (1992), which was another critically acclaimed success. He was initially set to reprise the role again for a third Batman film, even going as far as to show up for costume fitting. However, when Burton was dropped as director of the film, Keaton left the franchise as well. He was reportedly dissatisfied with the screenplay approved by the new director, Joel Schumacher.

It chronicles the events immediately following the death of 19-year-old Simon Limbres in a car accident. The novel was first published in France as Réparer les vivants in 2014 by Éditions Verticales, and was then published in the United States in 2016 by Farrar, Straus, and Giroux as The Heart, and in the UK as Mend the Living, also in 2016, by MacLehose Press. It has been performed as a theater play in France since 2015. A film adaptation, Heal the Living, was released in 2016. Plot Early one Sunday morning near Le Havre, France, 19-year old Simon Limbres and his two friends, Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher, go surfing. At the hospital, Dr. Pierre Révol, the head physician of the intensive care unit (ICU) department, discovers that Simon is unresponsive to auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation, and that his brain has suffered irreversible damage. Initially, both parents, especially Sean, are hesitant, citing the symbolic significance of Simon's body and their fear of it being destroyed during the transplantation process. His heart takes slightly longer to find a match, but soon one is found: Claire Méjan, a 51-year old woman suffering from myocarditis who, after three years of her condition gradually worsening, is in dire need of a heart transplant. Exactly twenty-four hours after Simon first stepped out for his very last surfing session, Claire finally has a new heart, and Simon's restored body is returned to his family the following morning. Characters Simon Limbres is a 19-year old boy who is declared brain-dead following a car accident after an early-morning surfing session. He is described as a passionate, adventurous, and carefree young man with a deep love for surfing. Because of his relatively young age and good health prior to his death, Simon is selected as an ideal candidate for organ donation. Ultimately, his heart, liver, lungs, and kidneys are donated. Marianne Limbres is Simon's mother. Like her husband Sean, whom she is currently separated from, Marianne feels immensely guilty for failing to protect her son, but she later realizes that allowing him to live his bold lifestyle was the best thing she had done for him. Lou Limbres is Simon's younger sister. Her name is whispered in Simon's ear by Thomas right before his operation, as requested by Marianne and Sean. Juliette is Simon's 18-year old girlfriend. She is resentful of Simon's passion for surfing, which she sees as an intrusion in their relationship. Christophe Alba and Johan Rocher are Simon's friends, with whom he went surfing on the day of his death. She is selected to received Simon's heart after being placed on the Biomedical Agency's priority list of recipients due to her state of acute deterioration. In The Heart, Thomas is assigned the arduous task of convincing Marianne and Sean to authorize the donation of their son's organs. She is scolded by Dr. Révol for speaking to Simon as if he were a live patient in front of his parents who, according to Dr. Révol, may misinterpret her words as a sign that their son can still be saved when in reality, he cannot. He hails from the so-called \"Harfang Dynasty,\" a prominent and wealthy family consisting of generations of physicians. Themes A central theme of The Heart is the acceptance of reality and death.

Anna Fitzgerald's older sister, Kate, suffers from acute promyelocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow cancer. Julia was once romantically involved with Campbell when they went to high school together, but Campbell broke her heart when he left her. Unbeknownst to Julia, Campbell left her because, after an accident that resulted in a concussion, he developed epilepsy and thought she deserved better. He is a self-confessed juvenile delinquent, which leads to their father Brian eventually confronting Jesse for his behavior. As Anna stands up to testify, Campbell Alexander has an epileptic seizure and, thanks to this, Julia discovers the reason of their breakup, leading her to swear to Campbell that he doesn't need to hide his illness from her, and that they can be together. Kate ends the story by reflecting on the tragedy and explaining that she feels deep guilt but also a bond with the part of Anna inside of her. Characters Kate Fitzgerald - A frail teenage girl who was diagnosed with promyelocytic leukemia at a young age. One of the few times that Kate experiences being a typical teenaged girl is when she dates, and has her first kiss with a boy named Taylor. Kate supports the feelings of her younger sister, Anna, and is thankful for the bodily donations Anna has been made to give her throughout her lifetime. At the end of the novel, Kate is revealed to be the one who asked Anna to sue for medical emancipation, because, fed up with the awareness of how much she took from her and the rest of their family, she wanted, for once, to be the sister who protected the other one. Andromeda \"Anna\" Fitzgerald - A girl who was biologically engineered in order to be a \"savior sibling\" to her elder sister, Kate. She is thirteen years old at the time the novel takes place, and seeks to be medically emancipated from her parents. She is the main protagonist of the novel. Throughout most of the novel, he is a delinquent teenager, but eventually reforms after a confrontation with his father. Sara Fitzgerald - The controlling mother of Kate, Anna, and Jesse. Sara refuses to accept the idea that Kate is likely to die, and in doing so she neglects the needs of her two other children, whom she keeps seeing in relation to Kate. Before the novel's end, Sara finally listens to Anna about Kate and comes to terms with her choice to die, expressing remorse for her behavior. Brian Fitzgerald - Sara's husband, who understands Anna's decision to not donate her kidney, but also feels compassion for his wife. He is fond of astronomy and becomes torn between his daughters, and his wife, during Anna's emancipation trial. He also shows concern for his son, and is the one to confront him about his troubling behavior. She also often advises Anna regarding medical emancipation. She and Anna's lawyer, Campbell Alexander, dated in young adulthood, before he left her without explaining why. Campbell Alexander - The lawyer who defends Anna as she tries to become medically emancipated from her parents. It is later uncovered that Campbell suffers from epilepsy, and that this diagnosis is the reason he broke up with Julia, as he did not believe she \"deserved\" an unwell mate, that she'd have to look after. Unlike Brian, Suzanne shows more support for Anna, even explaining how disappointed she is in Sara for how she treated both her daughters. She is a jewelry designer and she is fresh from a relationship with another woman named Janet.

Song by song, Hornby delves into what makes music catchy or classic, and how it can come to play an integral role in a person's emotional life. Proceeds from the book go to the TreeHouse Trust, a UK charity operating a school for children with autism and communications disorders, which Hornby's son attends, and to 826 Valencia, a US-based learning center, founded by McSweeney's publisher Dave Eggers, that offers writing workshops and tutoring.

However, if the players are not sitting at the same location but instead are at widely separate locations and pass the entire deck between them (using the postal mail, for instance), this suddenly becomes very difficult. And for electronic card games, such as online poker, where the mechanics of the game are hidden from the user, \n\n single-deck games better for counters. In games with more decks, casinos limit penetration by ending the shoe and reshuffling when one or more decks remain undealt. The googly is a major weapon in the arsenal of a leg spin bowler, and can be one of the bowler's most effective most important wicket-taking balls. The googly is similar in principle to the doosra, the ball from an off-spinner that turns the opposite way from his stock ball. A card cheat will typically bend some of the important cards during the game. In poker, for instance, a cheat may crimp one of the cards to mark off the exact location where he wishes his secret conspirator to cut the deck. Similarly, if the card cheat is not working with a confederate, he may bend one or more cards to force a cut upon an unsuspecting victim. In either case the deck will most likely be cut at the exact predetermined spot in the same way an old book always tends to open at the same page. Another poker scenario (also popular in numerous other games) is to crimp some of the high-value cards \n\n fingers just before it is released. Less skilled batsmen, or ones who have lost their concentration, can be deceived completely, expecting the ball to move one direction off the pitch, only for it to move the other direction.\n\nQuestion: With which game would you use a squidger, a circular disc between 25mm and 51 mm?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The song was first published in 1893 in Song Stories for the Kindergarten as a greeting song for teachers to sing to their students. Its popularity continued to grow through the 1930s, with no author identified for the new lyrics, nor credit given for the melody from \"Good Morning to You\". Based on 1935 copyright registrations by the Summy Company, and a series of court cases (which all settled out of court), the sisters became known as the authors of \"Happy Birthday to You\". Mildred Jane Hill, born in Louisville, Kentucky, was the oldest of three sisters, Mildred, Patty, and Jessica. She learned music from her father, Calvin Cody, and Adolph Weidig. It has been reported that Mildred Hill was a kindergarten and Sunday-school teacher, like her younger sister Patty. She wrote about music using the pen name Johann Tonsor, and her 1892 article \"Negro Music\", suggesting that the existing body of black music would be the basis of a distinctive American musical style, influenced Dvořák in composing the New World Symphony. Hill died in Chicago, Illinois, in 1916, long before her song became famous. She is buried with her sister in Cave Hill Cemetery in Louisville, Kentucky. Mildred Hill's manuscripts and papers are held by the University of Louisville Music Library in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nQuestion: The melody for which famous song was written by sisters and school teachers Patty and Mildred Hill in Kentucky in 1893?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Secondly, ambigraphic notation assists in the visualization of palindromes, which are sequences that read the same forward and backward. This is particularly relevant in genetic research, as palindromic sequences often have significant functional implications. By using this notation, researchers can easily identify and analyze palindromic regions in genetic sequences. Furthermore, ambigraphic notation utilizes common orthographic features such as stems and loops to highlight regions rich in guanine and cytosine. In addition, the ambigraphic notation supports the derivation of ambiguity characters, which are symbols used to represent multiple possible nucleotides at a given position in a genetic sequence.

When someone who previously could read loses their ability, it is known as alexia. The difficulties are involuntary and people with this disorder have a normal desire to learn. The underlying mechanisms of dyslexia result from differences within the brain's language processing. Some believe that dyslexia should be best considered as a different way of learning, with both benefits and downsides. Pure alexia, also known as agnosic alexia or pure word blindness, is one form of alexia which makes up \"the peripheral dyslexia\" group. A common myth closely associates dyslexia with mirror writing and reading letters or words backwards. These behaviors are seen in many children as they learn to read and write, and are not considered to be defining characteristics of dyslexia. School-age children with dyslexia may exhibit signs of difficulty in identifying or generating rhyming words, or counting the number of syllables in words–both of which depend on phonological awareness. They may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds (such as sounding out the three sounds of k, a, and t in cat) or may struggle to blend sounds, indicating reduced phonemic awareness. People with dyslexia are commonly poor spellers, a feature sometimes called dysorthographia or dysgraphia, which depends on the skill of orthographic coding. Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may include difficulties with summarizing stories, memorization, reading aloud, or learning foreign languages. Adults with dyslexia can often read with good comprehension, though they tend to read more slowly than others without a learning difficulty and perform worse in spelling tests or when reading nonsense words–a measure of phonological awareness. These associated disabilities include: Dysgraphia A disorder involving difficulties with writing or typing, sometimes due to problems with eye–hand coordination; it also can impede direction- or sequence-oriented processes, such as tying knots or carrying out repetitive tasks. In dyslexia, dysgraphia is often multifactorial, due to impaired letter-writing automaticity, organizational and elaborative difficulties, and impaired visual word forming, which makes it more difficult to retrieve the visual picture of words required for spelling. This can lead to problems with auditory memory and auditory sequencing. Many people with dyslexia have auditory processing problems, and may develop their own logographic cues to compensate for this type of deficit. Some research suggests that auditory processing skills could be the primary shortfall in dyslexia. For example, some have tried to associate the common problem among people with dyslexia of not being able to see letters clearly to abnormal development of their visual nerve cells. Neuroanatomy Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), have shown a correlation between both functional and structural differences in the brains of children with reading difficulties. Neural bases for the visual lexicon and for auditory verbal short-term memory components have been proposed, with some implication that the observed neural manifestation of developmental dyslexia is task-specific (i.e., functional rather than structural). fMRIs of people with dyslexia indicate an interactive role of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex as well as other brain structures in reading. The fact that some children with dyslexia have motor task and balance impairments could be consistent with a cerebellar role in their reading difficulties. Observed anatomical differences in the language centers of such brains include microscopic cortical malformations known as ectopias, and more rarely, vascular micro-malformations, and microgyrus—a smaller than usual size for the gyrus. Abnormal cell formations in people with dyslexia have also been reported in non-language cerebral and subcortical brain structures. Both environmental and genetic factors appear to contribute to reading development. Language The orthographic complexity of a language directly affects how difficult it is to learn to read it. Languages such as Spanish, Italian and Finnish primarily employ letter-sound correspondence—so-called \"shallow\" orthographies—which makes them easier to learn for people with dyslexia. Logographic writing systems, such as Chinese characters, have extensive symbol use; and these also pose problems for dyslexic learners. This is because they have language centers on the right and left side of the brain so language abilities can be recovered from either side. Use imitation. Build on what the patient uses by adding to their utterances. Imitating the speech of clinician. Start with short sentences and gradually add to the length. Start with repetition of words. Progress to 2 word phrases. Progress to three word sentences and beyond when ready. Answering questions from a story or picture. These cues may include: the first sound of the word, sentence completion, it rhymes with, function, location, word spelled out loud, and synonym/antonym. Choose words that are useful to the patient. Work on categories, associations, word combinations. Use pictures showing syntactic structures. Act out sentences and stories. Use materials that have meaning to the patient-for instance, a church bulletin from their church, a grocery add from the paper, a letter from a friend, the horoscope, a section of the paper that they are interested in, a greeting card, etc. After that is mastered, tracing letters, copying letters and then writing letters should be performed. Then the clinician spells words letter by letter, says words and the patient writes them and copies structured sentences. Teach survival writing skills. These include: signing forms, writing shopping lists, writing checks, writing notes to friends in cards or letters. f. Repetition drills for sounds, words, phrases and sentences. Start with sounds. Many repetitions are needed to stabilize newly acquired responses and make them automatic. k. Treatment of prosody should accompany articulation treatment.

In similar vein the episode of Gogglebox broadcast after Aherne's passing had Half the World Away play over the closing credits in her memory.

At the conclusion of a point, game, or set, the chair umpire times the players to ensure they follow ITF regulations on pace of play. The service is always made from the same end of the court (the \"service\" end); a good service must touch the side penthouse (above and to the left of the server) on or over the white service line on the receiver's (\"hazard\") side before touching the floor in a marked area on that side.

However, this symbolism is rejected by Ulster unionists, as illustrated by an exchange in the House of Commons of Northern Ireland in 1951: -James McSparran (Nationalist Party): The tricolour is admitted by all nations within the comity of nations to be the national flag of Ireland. It is the national flag of the Irish Republic. It is also used for the Ireland international rules football team, selected by the GAA on an all-island basis. Today, the flag no longer simply stands for European unity, but for the political struggle for a European federation. This has given it a character, unlike the European Union flag, of signifying struggle, in the fight against nationalism and against unionists who agree with European unity but are not willing to accept a federation which the federalists describe as \"the self-evident consequences\". Within the canton features a Lion of Saint Mark against a background of diagonal red, white, and green stripes. Following the outbreak of revolt in the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia in 1848 and the declaration of independence of the Republic of San Marco by Venetian separatists, the flag was adopted as a symbol of the new republic. Daniele Manin, President of the Republic, decreed on 21 March 1848 that the flag should come to represent the new republic following the end of Austrian rule. By including the traditional flag of the Republic of Venice, the insurrectionists simultaneously demonstrated continuity with the previous republic alongside newfound independence. The usage of a green-white-red tricolour as the basis of the flag was also significant insofar as it signified greater links between the Republic and the wider Italian independence movement. The colours red, white, and green represent the national colours of Hungary, as featured on the nation's flag. The team's traditional colours are green and red.

Hobbema was a pupil of Jacob van Ruisdael, the pre-eminent landscape painter of the Dutch Golden Age, and in his mature period produced paintings developing one aspect of his master's more varied output, specializing in \"sunny forest scenes opened by roads and glistening ponds, fairly flat landscapes with scattered tree groups, and water mills\", including over 30 of the last in paintings. He is notable for having been the subject of a well-known portrait by Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn in 1631, at the age of 58. The painting of him was done in oil on a mahogany panel, and measures 46 x 34 in (116.8 x 87.3 cm). The Shipbuilder and his Wife is a 1633 painting by Rembrandt. The sitters were identified in 1970 as Jan Rijcksen (1560/2–1637) and his wife Griet Jans Rijcksen.

He made his television debut in King of the Ghetto in 1986 and played the serious minded shop keeper, Ashraf Karim, in the BBC soap opera, EastEnders (1987–1990). Since leaving EastEnders he has appeared in the BBC comedy Waiting for God (1993), Brothers in Trouble (1995), Call Red (1996), Out of Sight (1996–1998), The Bill (1999), Hope & Glory (2000), The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003) and Second Generation (2003) among others. Whilst \n\n He played Doctor Craig Rothwell in the television soap opera The Young Doctors during 1976 and 1977. He also completed a stint in Heartbreak High playing Nat Delaine from 1997 until 1998. He appeared as Michael Watkins, the nephew of Ida (Vivean Gray) Jessop, on The Sullivans, from episodes #239-433. Niall Rafferty (born Matthew McQueen) is a fictional character from the British Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, played by Barry Sloane. Former Brookside actor Sloane was cast as the \"mysterious\" hairdresser Niall and was introduced by the series' producer Bryan Kirkwood. During Sloane's portrayal of Niall on-screen, he was central to a storyline involving the already-established McQueen family and it was revealed Niall was the illegitimate son of Myra McQueen (Nicole Barber-Lane). Niall was portrayed by upcoming actor Devon Jackson, the older brother of Hollyoaks actor Kieron Richardson, in flashback scenes depicting Niall's childhood. Niall's other storylines included his relationship with Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). David Barry (born Meurig Wyn Jones, 30 April 1943) is a Welsh actor and novelist. He is best known for his role as Frankie Abbott, (the gum-chewing mother's boy who was convinced he was extremely tough), in the LWT sitcom Please Sir! In 1988 he played Graham Farrell, a business associate of Mike Baldwin in Coronation Street. He later played the role of another police officer, Detective Sergeant Vernon Cooper, in Operation Julie, a three-hour dramatisation (shown in three parts) of the real-life drugs investigation. Coincidentally, Robert Gwilym also appeared as Detective Constable Dan Richard: he would return opposite Rouse for a recurring role in The Bill in 2004.

Going back to the room they slept in the night before, they notice a tiny hole in the boarded window. Chadhri enters the woods and sees Lecorpus and several of the natives standing near a helicopter. Badger asks Mossy to find the chamber and inform him if the Beast is living there so that Badger can spot the cat and force it to leave. Mossy starts his search, but he gets distracted by worms and loses focus. However, he eventually falls into a large chamber and discovers that the Beast is sleeping inside. He tries to leave quickly but the Beast wakes up and pursues him. Mossy digs underground but the Beast digs after him until Tawny Owl shouts out \n\n goes first, followed by Stacey, and then Gina. However, Chadhri tells John to wait before climbing on the web because it cannot sustain all their weight. Gina swings to the side of the chasm and throws Lecorpus in when he tries to kill her; he is swarmed by spiders and killed. They see Stacey, still wrapped in spider webs, being injected with venom and carried off into the temple by Lecorpus's brother.

Doug said he thought the parody was funny, and his daughters would call him Troy McClure behind his back as a joke. The product was discontinued shortly after its introduction in response to complaints from Schwarzenegger's attorneys.

Founder Dave Thomas is indecisive about the new recipe, and his shoulder angel and devil are him dressed in a white and red suit respectively. The label, which identified the maker as the fictitious \"Pumping Iron Brewing\", was designed as a generic-looking male bodybuilder viewed from behind, without including Schwarzenegger's actual likeness.

A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History Discovery The ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). He wrote a two-sentence footnote: This was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Classification systems Czech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. Other developments The first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. Genetics Blood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group. Subgroups The A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most common (over 99%). These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type: The same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.

Distribution and evolutionary history\n\nYou thought knowing your blood type was something people do for fun. From heart disease and strokes to certain types of cancer, here’s why your blood type matters. Unless you’ve recently given blood, you may not think much about your blood type. The presence or absence of certain molecules called A or B antigens, as well as a protein called the Rh factor, determine which of the eight common blood types you have coursing through your veins. However, these antigens make a difference beyond just your blood, influencing other body systems like your blood vessels, nerve cells, and blood platelets—which is why your blood type may impact your risk of certain diseases. Here’s why you should know what blood type you have. Non-O blood types have 25 to 30 percent higher levels of blood clotting proteins known as von Willebrand factor and factor VIII. Considering that type Os have lower quantities of the proteins that help blood coagulate, they’re also less likely to suffer from blood clots. (The downside is that blood clotting helps prevent excessive bleeding.) “It shouldn’t be assumed that being an O blood type means an individual is ‘protected’ or an A blood type is at higher risk,” says American Society of Hematology Councillor Terry B. Gernsheimer, MD. O may be the most common blood type, but it can interfere with pregnancy. Another interesting finding from the BMC Medicine study: Non-O blood types (A, B, or AB) also had an increased risk of gastric cancers, possibly due to an inflammatory response to H. pylori bacteria, the researchers write. (The bacteria is a cause of gastric ulcers.) Because of differences in clotting, A/B blood types are 31 percent more likely to suffer from venous thromboembolism—a clot that forms in the deep veins of the leg, groin, or arm—compared to the O type, according to research from the University of Minnesota. Though AB is the least common blood type, research suggests that people with AB are 82 percent more likely to develop cognitive issues in the future. It may be because this blood type comes along with higher levels of factor VIII, the study authors say. People with A or B blood type have up to 21 percent greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, per Diabetologia. (B positive had the highest odds.) While researchers note that it’s not exactly known why, one thought is that it may be that blood type influences the GI microbiome, which can affect glucose metabolism and inflammation. Another study found that although following the diet may work, it has nothing to do with someone’s specific blood type. There’s a theory that your blood type can explain why you act the way you do. While that largely hasn’t been proven, one Japanese study found that some traits differed between blood groups. Keep in mind that the research linking blood type and health conditions looks at population studies, so it can only find an association—not that your blood type is the cause. “The risk for any one person is multifactorial,” notes Dr. Gernsheimer. Your blood type certainly doesn’t seal your fate when it comes to your health. Even though there are many ways your blood type can influence your health, “there isn’t good evidence that one’s lifestyle should be altered because of it,” says Dr. Gernsheimer. And it’s not up to you to have this info should you need a blood transfusion, she says.

For human blood transfusions, it is the most important of the 43 different blood type (or group) classification systems currently recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusions (ISBT) as of June 2021. A mismatch (very rare in modern medicine) in this, or any other serotype, can cause a potentially fatal adverse reaction after a transfusion, or an unwanted immune response to an organ transplant. The ABO blood types were discovered by Karl Landsteiner in 1901; he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for this discovery. History Discovery The ABO blood types were first discovered by an Austrian Physician Karl Landsteiner working at the Pathological-Anatomical Institute of the University of Vienna (now Medical University of Vienna). He wrote a two-sentence footnote: This was the first evidence that blood variations exist in humans – it was believed that all humans have similar blood. This was the discovery of blood groups for which Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930. Classification systems Czech serologist Jan Janský independently introduced blood type classification in 1907 in a local journal. These two systems created confusion and potential danger in medical practice. To resolve the chaos, the American Association of Immunologists, the Society of American Bacteriologists, and the Association of Pathologists and Bacteriologists made a joint recommendation in 1921 that the Jansky classification be adopted based on priority. As a member of a committee of the National Research Council concerned with blood grouping, he suggested to substitute Janský's and Moss's systems with the letters O, A, B, and AB. Other developments The first practical use of blood typing in transfusion was by an American physician Reuben Ottenberg in 1907. And the large-scale application started during the First World War (1914-1915) when citric acid was developed as blood clot prevention. (1978) found that the human erythrocyte glycoproteins contain polylactosamine chains that contains ABH substances attached and represent the majority of the antigens. Genetics Blood groups are inherited from both parents. The ABO blood type is controlled by a single gene (the ABO gene) with three types of alleles inferred from classical genetics: i, IA, and IB. The gene encodes a glycosyltransferase—that is, an enzyme that modifies the carbohydrate content of the red blood cell antigens. As both IA and IB are dominant over i, only ii people have type O blood. Individuals with IAIA or IAi have type A blood, and individuals with IBIB or IBi have type B. IAIB people have both phenotypes, because A and B express a special dominance relationship: codominance, which means that type A and B parents can have an AB child. The resulting red blood cells do not usually express A or B antigen at the same level that would be expected on common group A1 or B red blood cells, which can help solve the problem of an apparently genetically impossible blood group. Historically, ABO blood tests were used in paternity testing, but in 1957 only 50% of American men falsely accused were able to use them as evidence against paternity. Subgroups The A blood type contains about 20 subgroups, of which A1 and A2 are the most common (over 99%). These two subgroups are not always interchangeable as far as transfusion is concerned, as some A2 individuals produce antibodies against the A1 antigen. Complications can sometimes arise in rare cases when typing the blood. There are six common alleles in white individuals of the ABO gene that produce one's blood type: The same study also identified 18 rare alleles, which generally have a weaker glycosylation activity. People with weak alleles of A can sometimes express anti-A antibodies, though these are usually not clinically significant as they do not stably interact with the antigen at body temperature.\n\nQuestion: What is the most common blood type in humans?

The most common use of a firework is as part of a fireworks display (also called a fireworks show or pyrotechnics), a display of the effects produced by firework devices. Fireworks take many forms to produce the four primary effects: noise, light, smoke, as well as floating materials (confetti most notably). Displays are common throughout the world and are the focal point of many cultural and religious celebrations.

Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure. This caused a considerable furore; Collier went into hiding and was outlawed, while Cook and Snatt were tried and found guilty but later released.

It was into this room that 36 barrels of gunpowder were brought, but when in late August Thomas and Fawkes made an inspection of the gunpowder, they found that it had decayed (separated). Shortly after this, Catesby recruited the last three conspirators, Sir Ambrose Rookwood, Sir Everard Digby and Francis Tresham. The following Monday, during the first search, Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk, noticed the huge pile of faggots in the corner of the cellar beneath the House of Lords. The king insisted that another search be made, and about midnight another party, this time led by Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet, discovered Fawkes and arrested him.

He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. Early life Harding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. Harding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder. Harding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension. Harding's crime spree began with the attempted robbery of a prostitute in Chicago, Illinois, on September 27; on December 10, he robbed and murdered Stanton Winston Blanton in Dallas, Texas, although he was never charged with this murder. On December 18, he robbed a man named Ronald Svetgoff and stole his car and identification cards, the latter of which he would use to feign his identity when he relocated to Arizona. On January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth. On January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him.

On January 3, 1980, Harding drove a stolen car to South Lake Tahoe, California, where he broke into the hotel room belonging to 35-year-old Charles Dickerson; Harding robbed Dickerson and left him bound and gagged. By the time a hotel maid discovered Dickerson, he had suffocated to death. On January 10, 1980, a car that he stole from Joseph Wohlers broke down on U.S. Highway 101; when 39-year-old Gerald Huth, a Bloomington, Minnesota native who worked for Sperry Univac, stopped to help Harding, Harding shot Huth to death and stole his car. While still in California, Harding used Huth's stolen identification to conceal his identity, and he used Huth's credit cards to rent a hotel room in San Diego, California. Like Dickerson, Gage suffocated on the gag placed in his mouth. On January 25, 1980, Donald Harding posed as a security guard to gain entry into a motel room in Tucson, Arizona where Robert Wise, a businessman, was meeting with Martin Concannon, his corporation's sales representative. Upon entering the hotel room, Harding hogtied the two men, beat Wise with a wooden motel lamp, and stuffed socks into Concannon's mouth; afterwards, he shot both men in the head and chest. Once both men were critically injured, Harding stole Wise's briefcase, which contained his credit cards; he then took Concannon's Oldsmobile. Authorities found Concannon's body in the hotel room's bathroom; he had also been shot in the chest and temple, and the bullet wound had also perforated his spinal cord, but Concannon's death was not instantaneous like Wise's death was; rather, medical examiners attributed his cause of death to the socks pushed to the back of his throat and obstructing his breathing passage, thereby suffocating him.

He was executed in 1992 by the state of Arizona by gas chamber. He became the first person to be executed in Arizona since 1976 when the death penalty was reinstated nationwide. Early life Harding was born in his house in a small, rural Arkansas community called Goodrich, located within Augusta. Harding's father was an alcoholic who abandoned Harding, his older brother Darryl, and their mother Maycle. When Harding's mother remarried to a man named Fred Brown who contracted tuberculosis, the family relocated to a sanatorium, where Harding alleged that nurses and staff regularly beat and mistreated him. One specific allegation involved a nurse dunking Harding's face in a toilet after he wet his bed. Ultimately, he settled with his mother in an impoverished area of North Little Rock. In his preteen and teenage years, Harding underwent three EKGs, the last one being in 1968. He was sent to the Arkansas Boys' Industrial School, and he spent four years cycling between that facility, his home, and the Arkansas State Hospital before his first long-term imprisonment. When he was 15, Harding was convicted of four counts of burglary and three counts of grand larceny. Harding was released from custody for these charges in 1973. Soon after his release, Harding was convicted in federal court for \"conspiracy to commit offense or defraud United States\" and was imprisoned again for five years. Harding was paroled from prison a second time in March 1979. Two months later, he was arrested in Pulaski County, Arkansas, and charged with a stabbing murder. Harding was in jail in Pulaski County when he escaped on September 17, 1979. He spent the rest of 1979 and part of 1980 carrying out a multi-state crime spree until his apprehension.

Both come from the same species of tree (Caesalpinia echinata), but Pernambuco, used for higher-quality bows, is the heartwood of the tree and is darker in color than brazilwood (which is sometimes stained to compensate). Pernambuco is a heavy, resinous wood with great elasticity, which makes it an ideal wood for instrument bows. Horsehair is stretched out between the two ends of the bow. The taut horsehair is drawn over the strings, while being held roughly parallel to the bridge and perpendicular to the strings, to produce sound. A small knob is twisted to increase or decrease the tension of the horsehair.

Another type of string hold, used on traditional bows, is the type favoured by the Mongol warriors, known as the \"thumb release\", style.

Many crops are in bloom, and honey bee colonies are collecting nectar and building up honey stores after travelling for pollination service. Queen bees and worker bees develop from fertilized eggs, and drone bees develop from nonfertilized eggs. Worker bees feed developing queen bees and worker bees a different diet even though they both develop from the same fertilized eggs. The larvae of both queens and workers are fed an enriched food, royal jelly, in the first day of larval development. Worker larvae are then fed secretions workers produce from “bee bread,” a food consisting of fermenting pollen and honey. Queen larvae, however, continue to receive royal jelly through their larval development and throughout their life. It also reflects the interdependence of plants and honey bees. Plants and bees share microRNA, a plant substance that affects bee development and a bee substance that is important in the development of certain flowers. Varroa mites are the greatest pest killer of honey bees. It is, therefore, necessary for beekeepers to be aware of the mite load that a hive carries and to take corrective action when mite numbers exceed critical levels. Varroa mites live in bee hives, and they reproduce in the sealed brood cells of the pupal stage of honey bee brood. Beekeepers who take a judicious approach to controlling parasitic mites develop their own Integrated Pest Management program that involves mite sampling and treatments as necessary. The guide and video demonstrations of Varroa control techniques may be downloaded from http://honeybeehealthcoalition.org/varroa/. As a social species, Apis cerana colonies contain divisions of labor depending on what each member of the group is specialized to perform. There is generally only one queen bee whose sole responsibility it is to lay eggs; therefore, she is the mother of all the workers present in the colony. Apart from the queen bee, the remaining female bees are known as the worker bees, as these individuals perform all the tasks necessarily to maintain the hive including tending to the eggs, larvae, and pupae, foraging for food and water, cleaning the facility, and producing honey. These tasks are divided among the female worker bees by a factor of age. The remaining individuals are the males, known as the “drones,” whose only responsibility is to mate with queen from another colony; therefore, drones are solely produced during the reproductive season. Greek bees generally tend to build up very quickly in the spring, with the queens being very prolific, resulting in strong hives. They also tend to make quite a lot of honey, but only in Mediterranean climates. Since the early 1900s, beekeepers in the United States started renting out their colonies to farmers to increase the farmer's crop yields, earning additional revenue from providing privatized pollination. As of 2016, 41% of an average US beekeeper's revenue comes from providing such pollination service to farmers, making it the biggest proportion of their income, with the rest coming from sales of honey, beeswax, \n\n A feeder is a vessel or contraption used by beekeepers to feed pollen or honey (or substitutes) to honey bees from a honey bee colony. Beekeepers feed bees when there is a shortage of those resources in nature, or when beekeepers want to mimic an abundance of those resources to encourage bees to behave in a certain manner. Modern beekeepers feed sugar syrup as a honey substitute in early spring to encourage comb building, during a dearth to provide energy to large colonies, in the autumn to help bees prepare for overwintering, or when creating nucleus hives. Pollen substitute is commonly fed to bees in early spring or when bees are located in a region with poor pollen resources. Feeders may exist outside the hive, be designed to fit certain hive designs, be an integral part of a hive design, or be used separately inside the hive. Feeders may attach to the side of the hive, or slot into the flight entrance, or placed above or below the nest inside the hive or as a purpose-built hive component.\n\nQuestion: What is the name given to the largest bee in a hive?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The cream used in some bars to make what is sold as \"Irish coffee\" is sometimes sprayed from a can. Some bartenders gently shake fresh cream to achieve a smooth layer on top of the coffee. In Spain, Irish coffee (café irlandés) is \n\n served with a bottom layer of whiskey, a separate coffee layer, and a layer of cream on top; special devices are sold for making it. Some bars in Southeast Asia serve a cocktail of iced coffee and whiskey, sometimes without cream, under the name \"Irish coffee\". Many drinks of hot coffee with a distilled spirit, and cream floated on top—liqueur coffees—are given names derived from Irish coffee, although the names are not standardised. Irish cream coffee (also known as Baileys coffee) can be considered a variant of Irish coffee, but involves the use of Irish cream as a \"pre-mixed\" substitute for the whisky, cream and sugar. Coffee milk is a drink made by mixing coffee syrup or coffee extract and milk together in a manner similar to chocolate milk.

George Karslidis was born in 1901 in Chadik, Tsalka, Georgia. In hagiography, as one of the Fourteen Holy Helpers and one of the most prominent military saints, he is immortalized in the legend of Saint George and the Dragon. His memorial, Saint George's Day, is traditionally celebrated on 23 April. England, Ethiopia, Georgia, Catalonia and Aragon in Spain, Moscow in Russia, and several other states, regions, cities, universities, professions and organizations claim George as their patron. St. George stands in lavishly decorated armour, and appears relaxed and nonchalant, raising his helmet and left hand to introduce van der Paele. George's armour is similar to that of St. Michael in van Eyck's Dresden Triptych, while his steel shield resembles those in the Knights of Christ panel of the Ghent altarpiece. Art historian Max Jakob Friedländer notes how St. George seems hesitant and unsure of himself in such a solemn and reserved setting. George is unsteady on his feet, and appears to struggle with having to raise his helmet \n\n at a monastery in Georgia, after travelling to Tiflis, Georgia, where a priest cared for him.

Brent Scowcroft was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford. A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming. Cheney campaigned against Al Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet. During the election, the pregnancy of his daughter Mary and her sexual orientation as a lesbian became a source of public attention for Cheney in light of the same-sex marriage debate.

The questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000. Contestants were given the standard three lifelines in place at the time (50:50, Ask the Audience, and Phone-a-Friend) at the beginning of the game. However, after correctly answering the $100,000 question, the contestant earned two additional lifelines: Three Wise Men and Double Dip (see Lifelines).

After his death in 1912, his descendants continued to own the club until 1982, when Ken Bates bought the club from Mears' great-nephew Brian Mears for £1. Bates bought a controlling stake in the club and floated Chelsea on the AIM stock exchange in March 1996. In the mid-1990s Chelsea fan and businessman Matthew Harding became a director and loaned the club £26 million to build the new North Stand and invest in new players. This investment effectively saved Leeds United from going into administration. Blackwell was forced to sell most of the remaining players, including Aaron Lennon; somehow he managed to build a team using loan players and experienced professionals nearing the end of their careers. Both Grant and ten Cate left the club at the end of the 2007–08 season. Chelsea assured Clarke of his status, citing his loyalty, popularity amongst the club's supporters and work in the aftermath of Mourinho's departure.\n\nQuestion: Who bought Chelsea football club for £1 in 1982?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Symptoms and characteristics Various symptoms are described in van Gogh's letters and other documents such as the asylum register at Saint-Rémy. Van Gogh suffered from some sort of seizures or crises, and in one of these attacks, on December 23, 1888, he cut off a part, or possibly all, of his ear. One of the most frequent complaints in Van Gogh's letters is the problems he endured with his stomach and poor digestion. Van Gogh suffered from hallucinations and nightmares at times. Van Gogh reported his impotence to Theo, his brother, in the summer after he arrived in Arles, and a month later when he wrote to Bernard it seemed to still be very much on his mind. Behavior Many analysts, such as American psychiatrist Dietrich Blumer, agree that one of the things Vincent van Gogh suffered from was bipolar disorder. From a young age, van Gogh grew up with a strong connection to painting and religion. After having worked at his uncle’s art dealership in the Netherlands, he transferred to another dealership location in London, where he fell in love with his landlord’s daughter, Eugenie Loyer. One author points out that “There was a family history of mental illness”, and van Gogh displayed symptoms of bipolar disorder, which is widely considered to be genetically inherited. Now an official devotee to the Church of Christ, van Gogh aspired to become a priest. His disarranged life style, however, caused him nothing but disrespect and rejection, such as the rejection from several theology schools throughout Europe around 1878. Van Gogh moved frequently due to sexual rejection in the next 10 years. He moved to Brussels in 1880 to become an artist. He moved to The Hague because his cousin, Kate, rejected him. He moved to Paris in 1886 because his companion, Clasina Maria Hoornik, recommenced prostitution and alcohol addiction. Van Gogh found shelter in his brother Theo’s small apartment, showing up on his doorstep uninvited. In Paris, it seemed that painting leveled and calmed his emotions. Van Gogh indulged in various activities which undermined his health, such as constant smoking, excessive alcohol and coffee consumption, and eating poorly, even fasting at times. There is some evidence that van Gogh nibbled at his paints, and the eating of paints is possibly connected with his seizure around New Year 1890. In January 1890, after another one of Vincent's seizures, Theo wrote to him saying \"if you know that it is dangerous for you to have colours near you, why don't you clear them away for a time, and make drawings?\" Van Gogh himself thought that he might have epilepsy and his doctor Dr. Félix Rey at the Old Hospital in Arles made the same general diagnosis, as did Dr Peyron at St Rémy. It has been suggested that van Gogh was not just bipolar, but that the crises in his last two years were brought about by the additional effect of thujone poisoning from his consumption of absinthe. Borderline personality disorder Van Gogh is believed to have had borderline personality disorder; he \"displayed symptoms best consistent with a borderline (personality) disorder: impulsivity, variable moods, self-destructive behaviour, fear of abandonment, an unbalanced self-image, authority conflicts and other complicated relationships.\" Dutch psychiatrist Erwin van Meekeren proposed in his book, Starry Starry Night: Life and Psychiatric History of Vincent van Gogh, that borderline personality disorder is the most likely explanation for van Gogh's behavior. Dr. John G. Gunderson, an expert on borderline personality disorder, concurred that van Gogh's \"longings for love, his sudden mood changes (and most particularly his seemingly unpredictable and unwarranted rages), and his pattern of impulsive acts, including substance abuse, are all recognizable components of the borderline syndrome...whether Van Gogh was borderline or not, it is a useful prism through which to view his troubled life.\" Vincent described the effects of the Arles sun in a letter: \"Oh!

Demands for a fitting national memorial had been voiced since the time of Lincoln's death. In 1867, Congress passed the first of many bills incorporating a commission to erect a monument for the sixteenth president.

What exactly is the chemical composition of Apple cider vinegar? Apple cider vinegar is the fermented juice of crushed apples. Being made from apples it contains pectin and potassium, which promotes cell and tissue growth. The typical Western diet creates an acidic pH in our bodies and many health problems are attributed to this. It is the best type to use for both health and cooking purposes. This is known as “mother,” and it indicates your vinegar is of good quality. Vinegar is made in a two-step process, related to how alcohol is made. In French, vinegar means “sour wine”. The first vinegar was the result of an ancient accident. Long ago, someone stored a keg of wine too long (presumably a poorly sealed one that allowed oxygen in). When the drinkers opened it, they found a sour liquid instead of wine- that was ACV. In Asia, vinegar is often called \"the best friend of Chinese herbs\" because it is frequently used to process herbal preparations. The historical origins of vinegar are not exactly known; it was probably discovered when our ancestors saw that wine exposed to the air turned sour, thereby creating vinegar. The process of creating this raw apple cider vinegar involves fermenting apple juice to wine or cider, which is then allowed to ferment a second time until the alcohol mixes with oxygen in the air, changing it into acetic acid and water. Apple cider vinegar is often called one of Mother Nature's perfect foods, so it seems fitting that medicinal apple cider vinegar must contain the \"mother,\" a term that refers to the milky sediment at the bottom of the bottle, which should not be confused with commercially made (nonmilky) processed apple cider vinegar, which is only good for taste, pickling, and cleaning. Japanese rice vinegar (米酢 komezu, \"rice vinegar\" or simply 酢 su, \"vinegar\") is very mild and mellow (Western - e.g., US or UK - vinegars are approximately 5% acetic acid) and ranges in color from colorless to pale yellow. It is made from either rice or sake lees. These are more specifically called yonezu (米酢 よねず) and kasuzu (粕酢 かすず), respectively. These vinegars are used in making sunomono (酢の物, \"vinegar dishes\"), tsukemono (漬物, \"pickles\"), nimono (煮物, \"simmered dishes\"), as well as in marinades to mitigate the stronger odors of certain fishes and meats. Seasoned rice vinegar (合わせ酢 awasezu) is made by adding sake, salt and sugar. Although it can be made at home, prepared awasezu can also be readily bought at supermarkets. In the culinary arts, vinegar is primarily used as a flavorful and acidic cooking ingredient. It adds tanginess and brightness to dishes and can be used in marinades, dressings, sauces, and soups. Vinegar is also commonly used in pickling vegetables or fruits, as its acidity helps preserve them. There are various types of vinegar available, depending on the source materials used during production. Balsamic vinegar, for example, is made from grape must and is known for its rich flavor and syrupy consistency. Malt vinegar is made from malted barley and has a distinctive malty taste. In addition to its culinary uses, vinegar finds applications in other industries as well. Overall, vinegar's versatility makes it a valuable ingredient both in cooking and various industrial settings. Some examples of traditional foods that are made using bacteria include yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Yogurt and cheese are produced using the milk-souring bacterial genus Lactobacillus, which ferments the milk and gives it its characteristic taste and texture. In the case of vinegar production, bacteria are involved in the process of fermenting alcohol, usually derived from grapes or apples, into acetic acid. The bacteria responsible for this fermentation process are known as acetic acid bacteria. These bacteria convert the alcohol into acetic acid through a two-step fermentation process, resulting in the sour taste of vinegar. In summary, bacteria play a vital role in the production of traditional foods like yogurt, cheese, and vinegar. Their fermentation abilities contribute to the distinct flavors and textures of these products.\n\nQuestion: Which English word comes from an old French word meaning sour wine?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is just over nine months (gestational age). When using fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth. Signs and symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods, tender breasts, morning sickness (nausea and vomiting), hunger, and frequent urination. The first trimester includes conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the Fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. During the first trimester, the possibility of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus) is at its highest. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care, though babies born at this time will likely experience serious health complications such as heart and respiratory problems and long-term intellectual and developmental disabilities. Babies born before 37 weeks are \"preterm\" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered \"early term\" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered \"full term\". Babies born between weeks 41 and 42 weeks are considered \"late term\" while after 42 weeks they are considered \"post term\". Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons. About 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012, of which, 190 million (89%) were in the developing world and 23 million (11%) were in the developed world. Terminology Associated terms for pregnancy are gravid and parous. Gravidity refers to the number of times that a female has been pregnant. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy more than 20 weeks are referred to as nulliparous. A pregnancy is considered term at 37 weeks of gestation. It is preterm if less than 37 weeks and postterm at or beyond 42 weeks of gestation. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended further division with early term 37 weeks up to 39 weeks, full term 39 weeks up to 41 weeks, and late term 41 weeks up to 42 weeks. Common signs and symptoms of pregnancy include: Tiredness Morning sickness Constipation Pelvic girdle pain Back pain Braxton Hicks contractions. Timeline The chronology of pregnancy is, unless otherwise specified, generally given as gestational age, where the starting point is the beginning of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Sometimes, timing may also use the fertilization age which is the age of the embryo. Start of gestational age The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the following methods to calculate gestational age: Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the last menstrual period. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy. The exact length of each trimester can vary between sources. The first trimester begins with the start of gestational age as described above, that is, the beginning of week 1, or 0 weeks + 0 days of gestational age (GA). It lasts until childbirth. Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures.

American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended further division with early term 37 weeks up to 39 weeks, full term 39 weeks up to 41 weeks, and late term 41 weeks up to 42 weeks. Common signs and symptoms of pregnancy include: Tiredness Morning sickness Constipation Pelvic girdle pain Back pain Braxton Hicks contractions. Timeline The chronology of pregnancy is, unless otherwise specified, generally given as gestational age, where the starting point is the beginning of the woman's last menstrual period (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Sometimes, timing may also use the fertilization age which is the age of the embryo. Start of gestational age The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the following methods to calculate gestational age: Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the last menstrual period. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy. The exact length of each trimester can vary between sources. The first trimester begins with the start of gestational age as described above, that is, the beginning of week 1, or 0 weeks + 0 days of gestational age (GA). It lasts until childbirth. Pregnancy is divided into three main stages, or trimesters. The third and last trimester is a critical time for growth, as the developing fetus will gain almost half its weight in this three-month period, and there is essential brain and lung formation. Extra sugar or glucose in the blood crosses the placenta and enters the fetus, raising its blood sugar levels. This causes the baby to produce excessive amounts of the hormone insulin, which lowers blood glucose. A large baby makes delivery more complicated and can increase the risk of health problems and injury for both the mother and the baby during the delivery. The American Pregnancy Association recommends eliminating the risk of harmful bacterial infections, such as toxoplasmosis and salmonella, by eating only thoroughly cooked meat and avoiding suspect seafood, such as clams. Abnormalities may cause calving problems. Occasionally, a difficult calving is caused by a skeletal defect in the fetus. Vulnerability varies at different stages of gestation. Vulnerability varies at different stages of gestation. Resulting skeletal abnormalities may hinder passage of the fetus through the birth canal. \"Lupine, hemlock or other plant alkaloids or toxins can affect the nervous system of the fetus. Many of these are simple recessives; the defective gene must come from both sire and dam in order for the defect to show up in the calf. In calves with arthrogryposis multiplex (AM, or curly calf syndrome), legs are crooked and twisted in different directions. \"Whether or not this fetus can be delivered will vary with the size of the calf. Many of the arthrogryposis calves we see are small, and even though there's a dystocia, you can usually manipulate the legs and get the calf out. With the larger ones, it can be a problem,\" says Steffen. An example of a calf with contractural arachnodactyly (CA), called fawn calf syndrome. Another inherited defect is contractural arachnodactyly (CA), called fawn calf syndrome. Affected calves have skeletal abnormalities that include a long, arched back with short underline; long leg bones; and long, weak pasterns. Even though many of these calves are unable to stand without help, most of them do survive. Some cases are subtle enough that the calves tend to grow out of it, according to Steffen. The Angus registration paper flags animals that are potential carriers of these genetic defects and documents if an animal is tested negative or a carrier. Pregnancy, also known as gestation, is the time during which one or more offspring develops inside a woman's womb. Pregnancy usually occurs by sexual intercourse, but can also occur through assisted reproductive technology procedures. Childbirth typically occurs around 40 weeks from the start of the last menstrual period (LMP). This is just over nine months (gestational age). When using fertilization age, the length is about 38 weeks. An embryo is the term for the developing offspring during the first eight weeks following fertilization (i.e. ten weeks' gestational age), after which the term fetus is used until birth. Signs and symptoms of early pregnancy may include missed periods, tender breasts, morning sickness (nausea and vomiting), hunger, and frequent urination. The first trimester includes conception, which is when the sperm fertilizes the egg. The fertilized egg then travels down the Fallopian tube and attaches to the inside of the uterus, where it begins to form the embryo and placenta. During the first trimester, the possibility of miscarriage (natural death of embryo or fetus) is at its highest. Around the middle of the second trimester, movement of the fetus may be felt. At 28 weeks, more than 90% of babies can survive outside of the uterus if provided with high-quality medical care, though babies born at this time will likely experience serious health complications such as heart and respiratory problems and long-term intellectual and developmental disabilities. Babies born before 37 weeks are \"preterm\" and at higher risk of health problems such as cerebral palsy. Babies born between weeks 37 and 39 are considered \"early term\" while those born between weeks 39 and 41 are considered \"full term\". Babies born between weeks 41 and 42 weeks are considered \"late term\" while after 42 weeks they are considered \"post term\". Delivery before 39 weeks by labor induction or caesarean section is not recommended unless required for other medical reasons. About 213 million pregnancies occurred in 2012, of which, 190 million (89%) were in the developing world and 23 million (11%) were in the developed world. Terminology Associated terms for pregnancy are gravid and parous. Gravidity refers to the number of times that a female has been pregnant. Therefore, during a second pregnancy a woman would be described as gravida 2, para 1 and upon live delivery as gravida 2, para 2. In-progress pregnancies, abortions, miscarriages and/or stillbirths account for parity values being less than the gravida number. In the case of a multiple birth the gravida number and parity value are increased by one only. Women who have never carried a pregnancy more than 20 weeks are referred to as nulliparous. A pregnancy is considered term at 37 weeks of gestation. It is preterm if less than 37 weeks and postterm at or beyond 42 weeks of gestation. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have recommended further division with early term 37 weeks up to 39 weeks, full term 39 weeks up to 41 weeks, and late term 41 weeks up to 42 weeks.

Beavers have also been shown to maintain habitats in such a way as to protect the rare Saint Francis' satyr butterfly and increase plant diversity. As an example, beavers have the capacity to modify riparian forest and expand wetland habitats, which results in an increase of the diversity of the habitats by allowing a greater number of species to inhabit the landscape. Whitaker reported a beaver colony in Salt Creek in 1994 as well as beaver sign in the lower portions of the Little Calumet River. Beaver create wetlands which remove sediment and pathogens and increase trout and salmon abundance as their ponds make ideal fish-rearing habitat. Research in the western United States, found that extensive loss of beaver ponds resulted in an 89% reduction in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) smolt summer production and an almost equally detrimental 86% reduction in critical winter habitat carrying capacity. In some areas, the presence of certain species (such as beavers) can be beneficial for flood control reasons. Beavers build and maintain beaver dams which will reduce the height of flood waves moving down the river (during periods of heavy rains), and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures, at the cost of minor flooding near the dams (often on farmland). They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds. While they may appear to steal food beavers have stored, more seemingly cooperative partnerships with beavers exist, as featured in the BBC David Attenborough wildlife\n\nQuestion: What name is given to the home of a beaver?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wallaroos are typically distinct species from kangaroos and wallabies. An exception is the antilopine wallaroo, which is commonly known as an antilopine kangaroo when large, an antilopine wallaby (when small), or an antilopine wallaroo when of intermediate size. At the time of birth, the scales are soft and white. The young cling to the mother's tail as she moves about, although in burrowing species, they remain in the burrow for the first 2–4 weeks of life. At one month, they first leave the burrow riding on the mother's back. Weaning takes place around 3 months of age, when the young begin to eat insects in addition to nursing. At 2 years of age, the offspring are sexually mature and are abandoned by the mother. The males compete for females during the breeding season. Females sexually mature at 17 months while males mature at around 20 months. However, the two species interbreed only rarely in the wild. Although interbreeding between the two species does occasionally occur in captive animals, viable offspring are only produced when the mating pair consists of a female eastern grey kangaroo and a male western grey kangaroo. As a marsupial, the common ringtail possum carries its young in a pouch, where it develops. The majority of the young are born between May and July. The average litter is two, although there are very occasionally triplets.

Released on October 4, 1994 by Elektra, it is Cole's first album featuring Christmas music and serves as a follow-up to Take a Look (1993). Holly & Ivy consists of 12 tracks, including 11 covers of Christmas standards and carols and one original song written by Gerry Goffin and Michael Masser. Upon release, critics gave generally positive reviews for Holly & Ivy, praising its composition and Cole's interpretations of the covered material. Holly & Ivy spawned one single \"No More Blue Christmas\". In support of the album, Cole filmed a television special, \"Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas\", at State University of New York Performing Arts Center in Purchase, New York; it premiered on WNET on December 7, 1994. Holly, especially the variety found in Europe, is commonly referenced at Christmas time, and is often referred to by the name Christ's thorn. Since medieval times the plant has carried a Christian symbolism, as expressed in this popular Christmas carol \"The Holly and the Ivy\", in which the holly represents Jesus and the ivy represents His mother, the Virgin Mary. Angie Mostellar discusses the Christian use of holly at Christmas, stating that: \"Christians have identified a wealth of symbolism in its form. The sharpness of the leaves help to recall the crown of thorns worn by Jesus; the red berries serve as a reminder of the drops of blood that were shed for salvation; and the shape of \n\n Ivy stond without the dore, she ys ful sore acold, Nay, my nay etc Holy and hys mery men, they dawnseyn and they syng, Ivy and hur maydyns, they wepen and they wryng.

Henry VIII wrote a love song Green Groweth the Holly which alludes to holly and ivy resisting winter blasts and not changing their green hue So I am and ever hath been Unto my lady true.

Written by George Harrison, it was the last new track recorded by the band before their break-up in April 1970. The song originated from their January 1969 rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios when they were considering making a return to live performance. Written at a time of acrimony within the group, the lyrics lament humankind's propensity for self-centredness and serve as a comment on the discord that led to Harrison temporarily leaving the Beatles. \"Easier\" is a synth-heavy new wave song, released as the album's lead single, with conversational tone and \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflective \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, \"I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me.\" The lyric focuses on a concept in which the causality of one's actions is immediate rather than borne out over a lifetime. The single was credited to \"Lennon/Ono with the Plastic Ono Band\", apart from in the US, where the credit was \"John Ono Lennon\". The song reached the top five in the British and American singles charts, competing with the Beatles' \"Let It Be\" in the US, where it became the first solo single by a member of the band to sell a million \n\n \"I Want to Tell You\" is a song by the English rock group the Beatles from their 1966 album Revolver. After \"Taxman\" and \"Love You To\", it was the third Harrison composition recorded for Revolver.

In combination with the song's philosophical message, Harrison's stuttering guitar riff and the dissonance he employs in the melody reflect the difficulties\n\nQuestion: Which song begins with the line The taxman's taken all my dough?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Sibbet was a money collector for a company run by Luvaglio's brother which supplied working men's clubs with fruit machines. Luvaglio was a Londoner with Italian roots who had moved from London to Newcastle to work in his brother's business. The victim was Violette Kaye (née Watts, also known as Saunders), aged 42. She had been a dancer and prostitute in London, where she had met Toni Mancini, aged 26 who had a criminal record including theft and loitering but who also worked as a waiter and bouncer. He was also known as Cecil Louis England (his real name), Jack Notyre, Tony English and Hyman Gold. He was shot dead on 1 June 1993 in the Royal Hotel (now Royal Inn on the Park) in Hackney, East London by an unknown assailant, who was described as being in his late forties and wearing a leather bomber jacket. Following his death, Moody was linked to multiple unsolved murders including that of gangster David Brindle in August 1991, of businessman Terry Gooderham and his girlfriend Maxine Arnold in Epping Forest, and that of \n\n part in the double killing of Social Democratic and Labour Party Senator Paddy Wilson and his companion, Irene Andrews, a Protestant.

The franchise began with the release of the classic Pink Panther film in 1963. Most of the films were written and directed by Blake Edwards, with theme music composed by Henry Mancini. Mancini also had an uncredited performance as a pianist in the 1967 movie Gunn, the movie version of the series Peter Gunn, the score of which he had composed. In the 1966 Pink Panther cartoon Pink, Plunk, Plink, the panther commandeered an orchestra and proceeded to conduct Mancini's theme for the series. At the end, the shot switched to rare live action, and Mancini was seen alone applauding in the audience.

They have one child together, Jack Quaid, born April 24, 1992. She and Quaid announced their separation in June 2000, and their divorce became final in July 2001. From 2010 to 2014, Ryan was in a relationship with American singer-songwriter John Mellencamp. Fawcett and O'Neal rekindled their relationship in 2001. On June 22, 2009, The Los Angeles Times and Reuters reported that Ryan O'Neal had said that Fawcett had agreed to marry him as soon as she felt strong enough. In 1986, she played Carole Bradshaw, the wife of Naval Flight Officer Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (played by Anthony Edwards) in Top Gun. Ryan appeared in the film Innerspace (1987) with her future husband Dennis Quaid, and later in the remake of D.O.A. Also in 1988, she played at the side of Sean Connery and Mark Harmon in The Presidio. Subsequently, she began to appear in supporting roles in films during the mid 1980s like box office hit Top Gun, achieving recognition in independent films such as Promised Land (1987) before her performance in the Rob Reiner-directed romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally... (1989) brought her widespread attention and her first Golden Globe nomination. Her other films include The Doors (1991), Anastasia (1997), When a Man Loves a Woman (1994), Courage Under Fire (1996), Addicted to Love (1997), City of Angels (1998), Proof of Life (2000), and The Women (2008). Holliday has been married twice. In March 1991, just two months after she met keyboardist Billy Meadows in a nightclub where she was singing, they married. \"He had a great sense of humor and he made me laugh all the time,\" Holliday says of her first husband. But in December 1991, just nine months later, they divorced; the marriage, according to Holliday, \"ran out of steam.\" She explained of Meadows: \"We just didn't know each other well enough.\" Jet magazine covered the marriage in their April 19, 1993 issue.\n\nQuestion: Which actress married Dennis Quaid on Valentine's Day in 1991?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

In particular, many leading Conservatives wanted Britain to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism, a move which Thatcher did not favour. In June 1989, the then Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe and Chancellor Nigel Lawson forced Thatcher to agree to the \"Madrid Conditions\", namely that Britain would eventually join the ERM \"when the time was right\".

P. Richardson were killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, together with pilot Roger Peterson. At the time, Holly and his band, consisting of Waylon Jennings, Tommy Allsup, and Carl Bunch, were playing on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour across the Midwest. The repeatedly mentioned phrase \"the day the music died\" refers to the plane crash in 1959 that killed early rock and roll stars Buddy Holly, The Big Bopper, and Ritchie Valens, and ended the era of early rock and roll; this became the popular nickname for that crash. However the overall theme of the song goes beyond mourning McLean's childhood music heroes, and reflects the deep cultural changes and profound disillusionment and loss of innocence of his entire generation – the early rock and roll generation – that took place between the 1959 plane crash and either late 1969 or late 1970. After the February 2, 1959, performance in Clear Lake, Iowa (which ended around midnight), Holly, Richardson, and Valens flew out of the Mason City airport in a small plane that Holly had chartered. Valens was on the plane because he won a coin toss with Holly's backup guitarist Tommy Allsup. Holly's bassist, Waylon Jennings, voluntarily gave up his seat on the plane to J.P. Richardson, who was ill with the flu. Around 12:55 am on February 3, 1959, the three-passenger Beechcraft Bonanza departed for Fargo, North Dakota, and crashed a few minutes after takeoff for reasons still unknown. His place as session musician in the Comets was taken by Franny Beecher, who would later graduate to full Comets member.

These zoonotic viruses include the rabies virus, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus. Preliminary evidence indicates bats are thus more tolerant of infection than other mammals. While much research has centered on bats as a source of zoonotic disease, reviews have found mixed results on whether bats harbor more zoonotic viruses than other groups. In contrast, a 2020 review found that bats do not have more zoonotic viruses than any other bird or mammal group when viral diversity is measured relative to host diversity, as bats are the second-most diverse order of mammals. Their behavior and life history also make them \"exquisitely suitable hosts of viruses and other disease agents\", with long lifespans, the ability to enter torpor or hibernate, and their ability to traverse landscapes with daily and seasonal movement. One possibility is bats' use of flight. Additionally, this fever-like response may help them cope with actual fevers upon getting a viral infection. While arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas may transmit viral infections from other mammals to humans, it is highly speculative that arthropods play a role in mediating bat viruses to humans. The same review found that bats do not have significantly greater viral diversity than other mammal groups. Bats, rodents, and primates all harbored significantly more zoonotic viruses than other mammal groups, though the differences among the aforementioned three groups were not significant (bats have no more zoonotic viruses than rodents and primates). Instead, more diverse groups had greater viral diversity. Bat adenoviruses are closely related to those finds in canids. They have since been identified in several other bat species, including the serotine bat, greater horseshoe bat, and the straw-colored fruit bat. The first bat\n\nBats provide several benefits to the environment and human society. Firstly, they play a crucial role in controlling insects. This helps in reducing the population of insects and controlling the spread of diseases carried by them. Additionally, bats contribute to the reseeding of forests. This helps in the regeneration of forests and the growth of diverse plant populations. Bats also play a significant role in pollination. Certain bat species have co-evolved with specific plants and become efficient pollinators. They transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing for the reproduction of numerous plant species, including economically important ones like bananas, mangoes, and agave (used for tequila production). Furthermore, bat guano (excrement) has several practical uses. It is used as a natural fertilizer in agriculture due to its rich nutrient content. Guano has been used for centuries to enhance soil fertility and agricultural productivity. It is important to note that while bats offer these benefits, they are also associated with the transmission of zoonotic diseases. In summary, bats provide essential ecosystem services, including insect control, forest reseeding, and plant pollination. Their guano is a valuable resource with various applications. species, indicating the recent divergence of these species. Many species are having edible fruits. Others swallow the fruit and pass the seed intact through the gut. An incomplete list of birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diet include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan. The fruits are an important food source for Palaeognathae highly dependent. Seed dispersal of various species in the genus is also carried out by fishes and big and small mammals as Pachyderms, Bovids, monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, or possums. They are highly diverse and can be found in various sizes and shapes. They include familiar organisms such as crabs, lobsters, shrimp, and krill. Overall, crustaceans are ecologically important due to their contribution to nutrient cycling, their position in the food web, and their ability to shape and maintain ecosystem structure. Flying foxes, also known as Pteropus spp., are megabats with a brain structure similar to that of primates and flying lemurs. They have keen eyesight and roost in trees instead of caves or houses. Male flying foxes sing during courtship, while females have single babies and nurse them at their breasts. This mutualistic relationship between flying foxes and plants benefits both parties. The bats obtain food from the fruit they consume, while plants benefit from the bats' pollination services and seed dispersal. As they feed on nectar, flying foxes transfer pollen from the male part (stamen) of one flower to the female part (pistil) of another flower, facilitating cross-pollination. This process is crucial for the reproduction of many flowering plant species. Additionally, flying foxes play a key role in seed dispersal. When they consume fruit, they often drop or excrete the seeds in different locations, allowing plants to colonize new areas and maintain genetic diversity. It's worth noting that flying foxes carry various viruses, including Hendra, Nipah, SARS, Ebola, and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers. This underscores the complex relationship between flying foxes, their viruses, and human health. In some regions, like Guam, there have been concerns about the concentration of neurotoxins from the fruit of the palm-like cycad Cycas micronesica in flying foxes. The Chamorro people of Guam, who consume these bats cooked in coconut milk, have experienced high rates of ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or Lou Gehrig's disease. Researchers have suggested that the neurotoxin from the cycad fruit may be contributing to the prevalence of ALS in this population. Overall, flying foxes exhibit interesting characteristics and behaviors, and their role in the survival and spread of flowering and fruiting plants is vital for maintaining ecosystem balance and biodiversity in certain regions.\n\nQuestion: Fruit, cricket and horseshoe are varieties of what type of animal?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The process naturally occurs with all post-pregnancy female mammals, although it may predate mammals. The process of feeding milk in all animals (including humans) is called nursing, and in humans it is also called breastfeeding. Newborn infants often produce some milk from their own breast tissue, known colloquially as witch's milk. In most species, lactation is a sign that the individual has been pregnant at some point in her life, with the exception of humans and goats. Nearly every species of mammal has nipples; except for monotremes, egg-laying mammals, which instead release milk through ducts in the abdomen. In only one species of mammal, the Dayak fruit bat from Southeast Asia, is milk production a normal male function. Oxytocin is critical for the milk let-down reflex in response to suckling. Due to lactation, the mother-young pair can survive even if food is scarce or too hard for the young to attain, expanding the environmental conditions the species can withstand. The costly investment of energy and resources into milk is outweighed by the benefit to offspring survival. In almost all mammals, lactation induces a period of infertility (in humans, lactational amenorrhea), which serves to provide the optimal birth spacing for survival of the offspring. After birth, oxytocin contracts the smooth muscle layer of band-like cells surrounding the alveoli to squeeze the newly produced milk into the duct system. Oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex, or let-down, in response to suckling, to occur. It is also possible to induce lactation without pregnancy through combinations of birth control pills, galactagogues, and milk expression using a breast pump. Although biochemical markers indicate that Secretory Activation begins about 30–40 hours after birth, mothers do not typically begin feeling increased breast fullness (the sensation of milk \"coming in the breast\") until 50–73 hours (2–3 days) after birth. Autocrine control - Galactopoiesis The hormonal endocrine control system drives milk production during pregnancy and the first few days after the birth. When the milk supply is more firmly established, autocrine (or local) control system begins. Thus the milk supply is strongly influenced by how often the baby feeds and how well it is able to transfer milk from the breast. Suckling by the baby stimulates the paraventricular nuclei and supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus, which signals to the posterior pituitary gland to produce oxytocin. Milk ejection is initiated in the mother's breast by the act of suckling by the baby. The milk ejection reflex (also called let-down reflex) is not always consistent, especially at first. Even thinking about breastfeeding can stimulate this reflex, causing unwanted leakage, or both breasts may give out milk when an infant is feeding from one breast. The release of the hormone oxytocin leads to the milk ejection or let-down reflex. Oxytocin stimulates the muscles surrounding the breast to squeeze out the milk. Breastfeeding mothers describe the sensation differently. If a mother has trouble breastfeeding, different methods of assisting the milk ejection reflex may help. These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region.

Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region. Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796).The first true mammals made their appearance some 200 million years ago and, over the course of tens of millions of years, diverged into three branches: The monotremes are egg-laying mammals, such as the duckbilled platypus, found only in Australia and New Guinea. Kangaroos and opossums are marsupials, found in Australia and the Americas, in which the newborn continue to develop outside the womb in a marsupium (pouch). Ninety percent of all mammals are placental (eutherians), in which the fetus is carried in the womb until birth at which time it is at an advanced stage of development. In 2013, a shrew-size Chinese fossil was found, named _Juramaia sinensis_ , which, at 160 million years, is thought to be the oldest placental mammal. Humans are placental mammals classified as **primates**. Mammals have a number of unique characteristics not shared by other vertebrates: Mammary glands are modified sweat glands that allow females to nourish their young with milk, the offspring's primary source of nutrition. (In 1758, Linnaeus named these animals _mammals_ , from the Latin = \"breast.\") Hair or fur, present at some time during life, protects mammals against extreme cold. The middle ear contains three bones that transmit sound vibrations into nerve impulses. Other characteristics, although not necessarily unique to mammals, include being warm-blooded (endothermic) and having specialized or differentiated teeth, a larger brain (in particular, the neocortex, the most advanced brain area), a diaphragm (a muscular sheet that separates the heart and lungs from the abdominal cavity), and an efficient four-chambered heart. **SEE ALSO:** Primates (c. 65 Million BCE), Placenta (1651), Paleontology (1796). This 1937 poster promoted infant nursing.Since then, the practice has increased, and experts recommend it for at least the first six months of infant life.# Birds\n\n**Charles Darwin** (1809–1882)\n\n# c. 150 Million BCE\n\nThere are some 10,000 species of living birds on all continents that have the common characteristics of being feathered, winged, bipedal, warm-blooded, and egg-laying.

These include feeding in a familiar and comfortable location, massage of the breast or back, or warming the breast with a cloth or shower. Suckling by the baby innervates slowly-adapting and rapidly-adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region.\n\nQuestion: Apart from being warm blooded and giving birth to live young, what do mammals produce to differentiate them from other families of animals?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The increasingly popular Luis Sepúlveda wrote stylish short novels like The Old Man Who Read Love Stories, and combined travel writing with imaginative fiction in Full Circle: a South American Journey. José Donoso's novel Curfew recalls the latter days of the recent military dictatorship, while Antonio Skármeta's novel Burning Patience (drawing on Neruda's life as a Chilean icon) was the inspiration for the Oscar-winning Italian film, Il Postino (The Postman). In 1950, Pablo Neruda, the famous Chilean poet, is exiled to a small island in Italy for political reasons. Mario looks for other work and is hired as a temporary postman, with Neruda as his only customer. He uses his bicycle to hand deliver Neruda's mail. Though poorly educated, the postman eventually befriends Neruda and becomes further influenced by Neruda's political views and poetry. Meanwhile, Mario falls in love with a beautiful young lady, Beatrice Russo, who works \n\n material written by Mário. Mario writes a letter but never gets any reply. Several months later, he receives a letter from Neruda. While there Mario comes upon an old phonograph and listens to the song he first heard when he met Neruda. To pass the time, he writes letters to his mother and daydreams about the beautiful Isabelle. When Dusoleil miraculously gains the ability to walk through walls, he begins to steal from the rich and give to the poor.\n\nQuestion: To which poet does Il Postino deliver mail?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He was committed to the concept of the ether, which was central to classical theories of electromagnetism, and Einstein's revolutionary ideas on relativity posed a challenge to this concept. Additionally, Whittaker emphasized the pre-eminent role of mathematics in physics, and it is possible that he considered Einstein's contributions to be less significant compared to the mathematical developments by Poincaré and Lorentz. Whittaker's emphasis on mathematics over physics could have contributed to his downplaying of Einstein's role. Furthermore, there were foundational philosophical disagreements between Whittaker and Einstein. Whittaker's correspondence with his son, archived at the Fisher Library of the University of Toronto, reveals a complex and personal context in which he attempted to diminish Einstein's contributions. It is worth noting that the accusation of antisemitism has been associated with Whittaker's treatment of Einstein, although this matter remains inconclusive due to insufficient information. In conclusion, the factors contributing to Whittaker's treatment of Einstein as an insignificant figure include his scientific conservatism, commitment to the ether, emphasis on mathematics, foundational philosophical disagreements, and the historical context of general relativity at the time. The potential influence of antisemitism, while mentioned in relation to Whittaker, remains unclear given the limited available information. Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with Max Planck. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in \"Einstein\" becoming synonymous with \"genius\". In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. In 1917, he applied the general theory \n\n Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the \n\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz made significant contributions to both physics and society.

By 1954, Ducati Meccanica SpA had increased production to 120 bikes a day. In the 1960s, Ducati earned its place in motorcycling history by producing the fastest 250 cc road bike then available, the Mach 1. In the 1970s Ducati began producing motorcycles with large-displacement V-twin engines, which Ducati branded as \"L-twin\" fort their 90° angle, and in 1973, introduced their trademarked desmodromic valve design. Ducati claimed weight is 10 lb heavier than the 1299, with foot pegs 10 mm higher. Ducati and Brembo designed 70 g-lighter brake calipers than the 1299's. The Ducati 899 Panigale is a 898 cc sport bike from Ducati, released in 2013 to replace the 848. The motorcycle is named after the small manufacturing town of Borgo Panigale. The unconventional decision to use a two-sided swingarm on a superbike from Ducati was made because of the substantial upgrades added to the bike including electronically adjustable anti-lock brakes, traction control, electronic braking control, and a quickshifter. The 899 surprised observers by topping sales charts for all motorcycles in the UK for December 2013, at a price five times higher than the number two seller, the Honda CBF125 — a situation compared by The Telegraph to the Ferrari California outselling the Ford Focus. For 2016, Ducati revised the 899, including enlarging the engine to 955 cc (the 959 Panigale). The Scrambler bikes' engines and frames are made at Ducati's Borgo Panigale, Italy, factory and then shipped to Thailand for final assembly. In 2018 Ducati added a new line of Scrambler models with a larger displacement engine (1,079 cc) and larger frame, the Scrambler 1100.\n\nQuestion: The Ducati is manufactured in which city and what country?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To the northwest, the Amnok River (Yalu River) separates Korea from China and to the northeast, the Duman River (Tumen River) separates Korea from China and Russia.

Originating in the Bayan Har Mountains in Qinghai province of Western China, it flows through nine provinces, and it empties into the Bohai Sea near the city of Dongying in Shandong province. Its basin was the birthplace of ancient Chinese civilization, and it was the most prosperous region in early Chinese history. Along the northern border with China runs the Yalu River and the Tumen River. In between the rivers, and the source of both, is Paektu Mountain, revered by both the Koreans and Manchurians as the mythic origin of each people. In the Zoige Basin along the boundary with Gansu, the Yellow River loops northwest and then northeast before turning south, creating the \"Ordos Loop\", and then flows generally eastward across the North China Plain to the Gulf of Bohai, draining a basin of 752443 km² which nourishes 140 million people with drinking water and irrigation. The Yellow River passes through seven present-day provinces and two autonomous regions, namely (from west to east) Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, \n\n received the shuttle, he had seen a wandering star interpose itself between the Weaving Girl and the cow herd (Altair).

On March 10, 2010, after Jimmy complained that neither of the previous presidents ever showed up to work, he \"elected\" a new president by picking one audience member at random. After an attack ad on behalf of another audience member, NBC Nightly News weekend anchor Lester Holt gave a news report about the president's short term thus far. He was listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having the longest running one man show ever and it was also claimed that he sold more albums in Northern Ireland than The Beatles. He also starred as \"The Head\" in the first season of Art Attack in 1990. He then appeared in commercials and radio comedies before acquiring a semi-regular slot as a contestant on the Channel 4 improvisation show Whose Line Is It Anyway?

He would later be succeeded as host in 1987 by Les Dennis. Hancock was also the first presenter when the series transferred to television two years later. The first ever guest on the TV version was comedian Bob Monkhouse who cast the French into Room 101. In 1999, Hancock was replaced as host by Paul Merton (who was also the first ever guest on the original radio version). Merton's first guest was Nick Hancock and his last was his fellow regular team captain on Have I Got News for You, Ian Hislop. Following Merton's departure in 2007, it was announced that a replacement would be sought; however, it was not until 2012 that a twelfth series, now fronted by Frank Skinner, was aired.

These principles formed the basis of classical mechanics and allowed scientists to explain phenomena such as planetary motion, the behavior of objects in motion, and the laws of gravity. Newtonian physics had a transformative impact on fields like engineering, mechanics, and physics in general. Quantum theory: Quantum theory, developed during the early 20th century by scientists like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, and Niels Bohr, revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It introduced the concept of quantum mechanics, which describes the probabilistic nature of particles and the dual wave-particle nature of light. This discovery paved the way for advancements in fields such as molecular biology, genetic engineering, genomics, and personalized medicine. They have provided the foundation for further research, technological advancements, and our overall understanding of the natural world. In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields; he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation. In 1917, he applied the general theory \n\n According to Maxwell's equations in the late 19th century, light was thought to consist of waves of electromagnetic fields and matter was thought to consist of localized particles. However, this was challenged in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect, which described light as discrete and localized quanta of energy (now called photons), which won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. According to de Broglie, for all matter and for radiation alike, the energy where h is Planck's constant. An important contribution to the Davisson–Germer experiment was made \n\n Although the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In \"Über die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen über das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung\" (\"The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation\"), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. Einstein saw this wave–particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics \"for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the\n\nQuestion: For what did Einstien gat Nobel prize in Physics?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The earliest such works, such as Stanley G. Weinbaum's 1935 short story \"The Planet of Doubt\" and Clifton B. Kruse's 1936 short story \"Code of the Spaceways\", portray it as having a solid surface; in the former, humans landing on Uranus encounter hostile aliens. Towards the end of the 20th century, there was a slight uptick in appearances by Uranus in science fiction, including the 1985 short story \"Dies Irae\" by Charles Sheffield about life in the atmosphere and the 1999 short story \"Into the Blue Abyss\" by Geoffrey A. Landis where there is life in the ocean below. Of Uranus' moons, Ariel was discovered in 1851 and appears in J. Harvey Haggard's 1930s novella \"Evolution Satellite\", and Miranda was discovered in 1948 and appears in the 1993 short story \"Into the Miranda Rift\" by G. David Nordley. The moon is named after Portia, the heroine of William Shakespeare's play The Merchant of Venice. It heads a group of satellites called the Portia Group, which includes Bianca, Cressida, Desdemona, Juliet, Rosalind, Cupid, Belinda and Perdita. These satellites have similar orbits and photometric properties. Discovered by William Herschel in 1787, Oberon is named after the mythical king of the fairies who appears as a character in Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. The moon consists of approximately equal amounts of ice and rock, and is probably differentiated into a rocky core and an icy \n\n Discovered on 24 October 1851 by William Lassell, it is named for a sky spirit in Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock and Shakespeare's The Tempest. Although William Herschel, who discovered Uranus's two largest moons Titania and Oberon in 1787, claimed to have observed four additional moons, this was never confirmed and those four objects are now thought to be spurious. All of Uranus's moons are named after characters from the works of William Shakespeare or Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock. The moon is also designated Uranus I.

Which direction was it really going? We didn’t know. So many difficult questions confronted us, questions we needed to ask not just once but every day: which systems were improving? Which were worsening? Which could improve and which couldn’t? Given enough time, all demented patients will become non-verbal and stop eating. For a doctor lacking a personal connection to the human being their severely demented patient once was, these choices are difficult at best. Keeping a sharp eye on both, knowing which to believe more on any given day, is extremely challenging. But this is where the art of medicine lives and wisdom and compassion are most vitally required. In the end, my patient survived. But the injury to his brain proved extensive: he was no longer able communicate in any way other than through grunts and could no longer bathe, dress, or feed himself. I wanted to ask him if he was glad he’d survived, if we’d made the right choices for him. But it wasn’t clear to me at that point if he would have even understood the question. That’s so sad. Who would want to live like that? Not me and not anyone I have asked. No one listened and he is paying the price! You have raised an interesting question, but there is one issue you haven’t addressed: money. Who will pay for such extended care? Why even begin? Yes, I am saying that at least partly, it’s a matter of money. (The NEJM agrees.) But the outcome—death—is the same. I don’t remember the author of this quote, but I think he had a point. It’s not enough to ask ALL patients’ families, What do you want done? We also need to help them understand that in some instances and at a certain point, interventions are futile. Society may pay the financial costs, but the patients pay dearly in suffering, confusion and lost quality of life. So, how did the son/family feel about the outcome?

It was a justified outcome, but the cops want to protect their own, and Faith, along with the entire Atlanta police force, are resentful of the man responsible, GBI agent Will Trent. He and Faith race frantically from the dormitories of Georgia Tech to the halls of one of Atlanta's exclusive private academies to keep another corpse from surfacing. Based on the original movie, the series features cyborg cop Alex Murphy (RoboCop), who fights to save the city of Old Detroit from assorted rogue elements, and on occasion, fighting to reclaim aspects of his humanity and maintain his usefulness in the eyes of the \"Old Man\", Chairman of Omni Consumer Products. Many episodes see RoboCop's reputation put to the test or soured by interventions from Dr. McNamara, the creator of ED-260, the upgradable version of the Enforcement Droid Series 209 and the top competitor for the financial backing of OCP.

As winter sets in, US Rangers must capture Hill 400, a strategic peak on the German border. But 98 per cent of us in the UK are still meat eaters. Chris Bavin, a greengrocer by trade and a carnivore by nature, wants to know if he can keep meat in his diet and stay healthy. He teams up with top scientists to put meat under the microscope and examine it as never before. An ambitious account of the story of human physiology in a feature-length dramatised documentary. Harnessing the magic of the most modern visual effects, we tell the story of the human body—inside and out—as it lives, grows, and dies on this predestined journey we call life. This unique National Geographic docudrama traces the life of a man, Adam, from the Cradle to the Grave, explaining the science behind our highs and lows, the rites of passage we all go through and exploring the inner workings of our bodies and how they change through time. Along the way we meet the class bully, Adam's first love and the sergeant major preparing him and fellow recruits for Vietnam. With the aid of stunning computer-generated visuals, we go under the skin to reveal how Adam's body responds to major life events, and his story is told in dramatic scenes from the 1950s to the present day. It’s no surprise; they are cheap, convenient and easy. Anja Taylor looks at whether exercise impacts aging and if changes in your mitochondria resulting from exercise effectively retard aging. Over your lifetime you undergo an extraordinary change - no other animal on earth goes through such a dramatic metamorphosis. In this programme, Chris and Xand van Tulleken explore the latest understanding of how we all grow. And we still continue to consume these products in ever greater quantities. So, why do we consume so much processed food and why are we so hooked on it? How exactly does the relentless agribusiness keep us coming back for more? How does it mold our tastes, influence our cravings and feed our addictions? They are even involved in government campaigns on nutrition and health. Remi, our French-American reporter, will investigate current eating habits in Europe and America, and meet those involved in this new global food war. We will hear from scientists tracking sugar addiction, the businessmen playing on our weaknesses, legal experts preparing to challenge the might of the industry, and simple lovers of good food. A compelling documentary that reveals the latest ways the agribusiness is trying to tempt us, and the ways we as consumers can try to resist. As his name suggests, rapper and documentary maker Professor Green has a past relationship with cannabis. Before finding success as a musician he sold weed, and between the ages of 16 and 24 he smoked cannabis every day - but things have changed since then. With those days behind him, Professor Green, aka Stephen Manderson, embarks on a uniquely personal film to take an in-depth look at our relationship with Britain’s most popular illegal drug and explores the arguments for and against legalisation. Stephen explores today’s booming UK cannabis industry, from the realities of life as a dealer, grower and even weed robber, to the consumers with ever-increasing options about how and what they buy. As he comes to reflect on his background and wrestle with his own past, Stephen explores addiction and the links between cannabis use and mental health.\n\nQuestion: Who was part man, part machine, all cop and hailed from a futuristic Detroit?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

She is portrayed in a lavender dress with a feather boa, an archetypal Hollywood starlet much more in keeping with the character of Miss Piggy rather than Glinda. Miss Piggy's other role is herself. After Dorothy's journey, she returns for the Muppets' show. In the film, the song is performed by Gary (Jason Segel), Walter (Peter Linz), a Muppet form of Gary (Bill Barretta), and Walter's human form (Jim Parsons). Through the course of the film, Gary is oblivious to the desires of his longtime girlfriend, Mary (Amy Adams), and instead offers to sacrifice his time to assist the rest of the Muppets return to fame.

Although it takes the name of the second Bourne novel (1986), its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy. It is preceded by The Bourne Identity (2002) and followed by The Bourne Ultimatum (2007), The Bourne Legacy (2012), and Jason Bourne (2016). The Bourne Supremacy continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone. George Nolfi, who co-wrote the screenplay for the Bourne Ultimatum film, was to write the screenplay for a fourth film. Matt Damon was also attached to the project from the start, and Julia Stiles as well as Joan Allen had been asked to join the project, with Paul Greengrass slated to return as director. On June 9, 2010, it was announced that Tony Gilroy would be writing and directing a movie entitled The Bourne Legacy that would have a 2012 release date. The new film would have nothing but the title in common with Van Lustbader's novel, and would be a side-story with a new character \"in the mold of Bourne\", dealing with the ramifications of the events in the third film. So, with only Conklin's cell phone and a torn page from a notebook to go on, Jason Bourne sets off to find out who is trying to kill him and who killed his friends.\n\nQuestion: Who wrote the Bourne trilogy of books, made into movies starring Matt Damon?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cats have protractible and retractable claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The dewclaw is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth \"finger\". This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an antiskidding device used while jumping. Some cat breeds are prone to having extra digits (“polydactyly”).

Lehmann's contract with Arsenal expired at the end of the season, and then he decided to retire once again. On 8 September 2018, a match was organised between Arsenal legends and Real Madrid legends in which Lehmann appeared after David Seaman picked up injury during training. Arsenal legends won 5–3 on penalties, with Lehmann scoring the last penalty for Arsenal. Everton then won their first league game at home in over three months as James McCarthy opened the scoring with his first goal of the year against Newcastle United and further strikes from Lukaku and Ross Barkley completed a 3–0 victory. Many pundits had tipped Everton for relegation that season: having escaped relegation from the Premier League by six points the previous season, Everton's task to stay in English football's top flight only seemed harder after the multimillion-pound transfer of teenage striker Wayne Rooney to Manchester United after setting the summer's European Championships alight. However, the season turned out to be Everton's most successful in Premier League history as they placed fourth in the league with 61pts. Everton kept pace with the likes of Chelsea (95pts) and Arsenal (83pts) at the Premier League summit for the first half of the season, finishing 2004 only a few points adrift of leaders Chelsea. Although Everton's title challenge eventually fizzled out following the sale of out-of-contract midfielder Thomas Gravesen to Spanish giants \n\n with Everton finishing champions for the second time in three seasons. Tony Adams, the 20-year-old centre-half who played in every single game for Arsenal this season, was voted PFA Young Player of the Year. Striker Niall Quinn and wingers David Rocastle and Martin Hayes both became regular members of the first team this season, with Hayes finishing as Arsenal's top scorer with 24 goals. The match threatened to descend into a mass brawl soon after, when Fortune caught Ljungberg in the face with a flailing arm and then committed a high tackle on Edu, provoking a reaction from the Arsenal players.\n\nQuestion: Wayne Rooney scored his first senior goal against which club?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The success of Liverpool FC was some compensation for the city's economic misfortune during the 1970s and 1980s. The club, formed in 1892, had won five league titles by 1947, but enjoyed its first consistent run of success under the management of Bill Shankly between 1959 and 1974, winning a further three league titles as well as the club's first two \n\n Liverpool Football Club is a professional association football club in Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) competitions.

This style began China's interest in popular crime fiction, and is what drove Cheng Xiaoqing to write his own crime fiction novel, Sherlock in Shanghai. In the late 1910s, Cheng began writing detective fiction very much in Conan Doyle's style, with Bao as the Watson-like narrator; a rare instance of such a direct appropriation from foreign fiction. The Enola Holmes Mysteries is a young adult fiction series of detective novels by American author Nancy Springer, starring Enola Holmes as the 14-year-old sister of an already-famous Sherlock Holmes, twenty years her senior. When their mother disappears, Enola's brothers, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes, decide to send her to a finishing school against her will. Instead, with the aid of her mother who had provided hidden funds and an elaborate cipher for her daughter to communicate with her, Enola runs away to London where she establishes a clandestine private detective career specializing in \n\n Doyle pursued an education in the medical field,where he began writing short stories. Conan Doyle published The Sign of Four in 1890, which established Sherlock Holmes as a prominent character and did wonders in putting Conan Doyle on the map literature map in the United Kingdom and United States. In the year Conan Doyle published The Great Shadow, His wife, Louisa, gave birth to a son named Kingsley. Conan Doyle calls this \"the chief event' of their life. The following year Conan Doyle infamously decided to kill off Sherlock Holmes. Black adds that Christie's work is, in its way, typical of the literature of the interwar period, much of which reflected a concern about foreign threats and links between domestic and international challenges.

Dürnstein, Austria - Dürnstein is a small town on the Danube river in the Krems-Land district, in the Austrian state of Lower Austria. Visitors can see the crooked medieval streets, quaint 16th and 18th century town houses, colorful wine taverns as well as the ruins of a castle, where Richard the Lionhearted was allegedly imprisoned. The large, baroque main square is also worth a visit. It is best known as the site of a massive baroque Benedictine monastery named Melk Abbey. Passau, Germany - Passau is a town in Lower Bavaria, Germany. It is also known as the Dreiflüssestadt or \"City of Three Rivers,\" because the Danube is joined at Passau by the Inn from the south and the Ilz from the north.

The most important inland waterway is the Danube (part of Pan-European Corridor VII). Other navigable rivers include Sava, Tisza, Begej and Timiş River, all of which connect Serbia with Northern and Western Europe through the Rhine–Main–Danube Canal and North Sea route, to Eastern Europe via the Tisza, Begej and Danube Black Sea routes, and to Southern Europe via the Sava river. More than 2 million tons of cargo were transported on Serbian rivers and canals in 2016 while the largest river ports are: Novi Sad, Belgrade, Pančevo, Smederevo, Prahovo and Šabac. Ptolemy, in the 2nd century AD, would describe the Vistula as the border between Germania and Sarmatia. The Vistula river used to be connected to the Dnieper River, and thence to the Black Sea via the Augustów Canal, a technological marvel with numerous sluices contributing to its aesthetic appeal. It was the first waterway in Central Europe to provide a direct link between the two major rivers, the Vistula and the Neman. It provided a link with the Black Sea to the south through the Oginski Canal, Dnieper River, Berezina Canal, and Dvina River. The Baltic Sea&ndash; Vistula&ndash; Dnieper&ndash; Black Sea \n\n The Mária Valéria Bridge joins Esztergom in Hungary and Štúrovo in Slovakia, across the River Danube. The bridge is some 500 metres in length. The bridge was designed by in 1893; he built several bridges on the Danube, including the Liberty Bridge (originally the Franz Joseph Bridge) in Budapest and the Elisabeth Bridge between Komárno and Komárom. For other uses, see Vistula (disambiguation). The Vistula (Wisła,, Weichsel) is the longest river in Poland and the 9th-longest river in Europe, at 1047 km in length. The drainage basin, reaching into three other nations, covers 193,960 km2, of which 168,868 km2 is in Poland. The Vistula rises at Barania Góra in the south of Poland, 1220 m above sea level in the Silesian Beskids (western part of Carpathian Mountains), where it begins with the Little White Vistula (Biała Wisełka) and the Black Little Vistula (Czarna Wisełka). It flows through Poland's largest cities, including Kraków, Sandomierz, Warsaw, Płock, Włocławek, Toruń, Bydgoszcz, Świecie, Grudziądz, Tczew and Gdańsk.

It is beneficial in certain type of ear problems such as tinitis, glue ear, middle ear infections. If a person wants to perform nasal cleansing, he can do it over a sink, on a bowl on a table, inside the shower. The temperature of water has to be suitable for pouring in the nose. To check the temperature pour a bit on your arm or taste it and then spit to check its temperature. Place the nose cone in the right nostril, and sealing it after a few twists and slight pressure. Put the spout straight up in the line with the nasal passage so that the tip of the nozzle will not get blocked inside the nose. At this time, do not sniff, laugh, talk, swallow or do not have any kind of movement through the nose while water is flowing through it. Now slowly bend in front from the waist so that the tip of the nose will become the lowest point of the head; slightly tilt the head to the right, so that left nostril will become the lowest point of the nose. Tilt slowly so that water will not come out of the top onto your face. Keep the cone of the neti vessel fully sealed into the right nostril so that it doesn’t leak. Keep the breathing on while the water comes through it. Keep breathing through the mouth slowly. Before going on other side, Blow out air gently through both nostrils to clear mucus and water from the nose. After the whole liquid finished, stand up and blow out gently through both nostrils and then prepare to dry out the nose. Even after this, if your nose doesn’t get clear than it is recommended that you visit the family physician to ascertain if there is some kind of structural blockage in the nose. Forward bend drying of the nose properly is very important part of this practice. People suffering from high blood pressure should be careful while doing this part. If dizziness occurs while using neti the nose, drying should be done standing upright. First bend towards forward from the waist and do head upside down with the nose towards the floor that will help any residual water to remove from the nose. Then the nose is to be pointed towards the knees. Then resume the standing position and do some fast breathing through the nostrils. Then do 10 rapid sniffing breathes again through both the nostrils together. It is important dry nose properly as it may manifest the symptoms of cold for some hours, or in some cases it may cause sinus problem. The second stage of Jala neti is called as sinus bellowing, or Vyutkrama kapalbhati. One should not swallow any water when they sniff backwards, although it’s not dangerous. The nose has to be dry completely after stage 2, as more water flow from the nasal passages. It may cause serious irritation for some time if nose is not dried completely. Inhale water separately through each nostril and through it out of the mouth than do both simultaneously. Do not consume; to avoid infection dry nose completely. In Dugdha neti, milk is used in place of water, pre-warmed to body temperature, It is suitable for those person who suffer from chronic nose bleeds or those who get irritation from the use of salty water. Milk Neti is done in case where the nasal lining is already irritated, for example in case of sanding plaster. Milk neti is used in case where nasal mucosa is already irritated, from the sanding plaster. Sutra Neti can be of a very great importance, and it is very much recommended for those who tried jala neti for some time and persons who find that most of the time the same nostril is blocked. Some time there is a problem like some kind of fleshy obstruction such as cartilages. Instead of a medical operation, Sutra neti is possible alternative for removing these blockages. In case of polpys, deviated septum or other diseases related to nose\n\n Eurypterids with swimming legs were capable of both walking on the bottom of bodies of water or swimming through them. This may be accomplished either by accelerating the water past the swimmer or by supporting the swimmer, either in water or on dry land. In the event of accidental flooding, the whole mask must be removed to continue breathing. Unless the snorkeler is able to equalize without pinching their nose it can only be used on the surface, or a couple of feet below since the design makes it impossible to pinch the nose in order to equalise pressure at greater depth. After all, being surrounded by the ocean presents the unique opportunity to enjoy activities like surfing, swimming, body surfing, body boarding, paddling and more year-round. While all of these activities are fun, Dr. John Cho, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Straub Medical Center, shares some knowledge on how to prevent and treat common water-induced ear diagnoses like surfer’s ear, swimmer’s ear and perforated ear drums. Some symptoms of swimmer’s ear can include redness, itchiness, pain, temporary hearing loss and pus-like fluid draining from the ear. Wear customized ear plugs in the water. Visit an ear, nose and throat specialist for periodic cleaning. This combination encourages bony developments to grow in the ear, therefore restricting the ear canal. Wetsuits do not protect the ears. Wear swim caps or neoprene hoods in the water. A perforated ear drum can happen in water sports when traumatic forces act upon the ear. For example, if an ear is slapped by a wave, the pressure could cause the ear drum to rupture, which makes it more susceptible to infection. However, having an ear, nose and throat specialist monitor the status of the ruptured ear drum is extremely important to ensure the ear is healing properly.\n\nQuestion: In which sport or pastime can you see nose walking?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The two most common types of \"glaucoma tests\" performed during a routine eye exam are non-contact tonometry and applanation tonometry. In non-contact tonometry (NCT), an instrument emits a quick puff of air toward the surface of your eye. Nothing but air touches your cornea. The \"gold standard\" method for measuring eye pressure is called applanation tonometry. In applanation tonometry, the instrument that measures your IOT has a small sensor that gently touches the surface of your eye. Who is most at risk for glaucoma? Is there any way to prevent glaucoma? Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the most common form of glaucoma. Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be reversed. If the drops don't work, surgery may be the next step. Can marijuana be used to treat glaucoma? The possible use of marijuana for the management of glaucoma has been debated for years. However, the current consensus among clinicians is that medical marijuana needs further research as a therapeutic agent for glaucoma, and that it currently does not appear to be as effective as FDA-approved glaucoma medications and treatments. People being treated for glaucoma typically are not good candidates for LASIK. This is because a suction device is used on the eye during the creation of the corneal flap during LASIK surgery, and this briefly causes a significant increase in IOP. But you might be a candidate for another type of vision correction surgery, such as PRK, which does not require the use of a suction device. Tonometry . Gonioscopy . You will place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar while looking straight ahead. The goniolens is placed lightly on the front of your eye, and a narrow beam of light is directed into your eye while your doctor looks through the slit lamp at the drainage angle. There are two types of ophthalmoscopy: direct and indirect. With indirect ophthalmoscopy, the ophthalmologist wears a headband with a light attached and uses a small handheld lens to look inside your eye. Indirect ophthalmoscopy allows a better view of the fundus, even if your natural lens is clouded by cataracts. The peripheral (side) vision of each eye is tested with visual field testing, or perimetry. While you stare at the center of the bowl, lights will flash off and on. A computer records your response to each flash. Photography . Sometimes photographs or other computerized images are taken of the optic nerve to inspect the nerve more closely for damage from elevated pressure in the eye. Special imaging . The most common form of glaucoma is primary open-angle glaucoma , in which the aqueous fluid is blocked from flowing back out of the eye at a normal rate through a tiny drainage system. Most people who develop primary open-angle glaucoma notice no symptoms until their vision is impaired. If your risk is high, your eye doctor may recommend treatment to lower your IOP to prevent future damage. In angle-closure glaucoma , the iris (the colored part of the eye) may drop over and completely close off the drainage angle, abruptly blocking the flow of aqueous fluid and leading to increased IOP and optic nerve damage. In acute angle-closure glaucoma there is a sudden increase in IOP due to the buildup of aqueous fluid. This condition is considered an emergency because optic nerve damage and vision loss can occur within hours of the problem. This condition is called normal-tension glaucoma . Normal-tension glaucoma is not well understood, but lowering IOP has been shown to slow progression of this form of glaucoma. Your eye doctor will often set a “target” pressure for you and will adjust the treatment to keep the pressure close to or below that target to help preserve your vision. Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is a relatively common form of open-angle glaucoma that can cause significantly high eye pressures. This material can clog the ocular drainage system, increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) . Pseudoexfoliation glaucoma is found in all ethnic groups, but it is most commonly seen in people of Scandinavian ancestry. Treatment is often required for pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, consisting of medication, laser treatment, or surgery. Pseudoexfoliation can cause increased complications with cataract surgery. With proper treatment and monitoring, patients with pseudoexfoliation glaucoma tend to do well. If your eye is injured, there is a chance you will develop traumatic glaucoma. If an eye is hit hard enough to cause bleeding in the front part of the eye, this is called a hyphema . A hyphema increases the possibility of a rise in eye pressure. In cases of a hyphema, there is also a chance of a future increase in eye pressure. Therefore, anyone who has had eye trauma should be sure to have intraocular pressure\n\n Palpation is one of the oldest, simplest, and least expensive methods for approximate IOP measurement. A newer transpalpebral and transscleral tonometry method is not influenced by corneal biomechanics and does not need to be adjusted for corneal irregularities as measurement is done over upper eyelid and sclera. Tonometry is a technique used by eye care professionals to measure the intraocular pressure (IOP), which refers to the fluid pressure inside the eye. It plays a crucial role in evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma. There are different types of tonometers available, but most are calibrated to measure pressure in millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The specific method used may vary depending on the equipment and technique employed by the eye care professional. One common type of tonometry is called applanation tonometry, which involves gently touching the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) with a small probe or device. This allows for an accurate measurement of IOP based on how much force is needed to flatten a small area of the cornea. Another type is non-contact tonometry, also known as air-puff tonometry. In this method, a quick puff of air is directed towards the cornea while a sensor measures changes in reflection or indentation caused by the air puff. Overall, tonometry serves as an essential tool for evaluating patients at risk of glaucoma because it allows eye care professionals to measure intraocular pressure accurately. At Executive Park Eye Care, our eye doctors will perform a glaucoma test as part of your comprehensive eye exam. Our Colorado Springs office is equipped with state-of-the-art optometric technology that will diagnose glaucoma accurately. Who is at high risk for Glaucoma? What happens during a Glaucoma Eye Exam in Colorado Springs, CO? After your eye is numbed with eye drops, a tonometer is used to measure intraocular pressure (IOP). For the best preventive care – contact us to schedule your eye exam and glaucoma test in our optometry practice in Colorado Springs. What are some Glaucoma Treatments offered by eye doctors in Colorado Springs? The current goal of all glaucoma treatments is to lower or stabilize the pressure in your eye, which will hopefully prevent damage to your optic nerve. The first line of defense is typically medicated eye drops. Depending upon how far the disease has progressed, other glaucoma treatments include conventional (bladed) surgery, laser procedures or a combination of all of the above.\n\nQuestion: In which occupation would you rotate the gog at the end of your nose?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Visually Impaired (VI): Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment and the athlete with visual impairment are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates. Boccia can be played by individuals, pairs, or teams of three. The aim of the game is to throw leather balls – coloured red or blue (which side gets which is determined by a coin toss) – as close as they can to a white target ball, or jack. In this fashion, each end will continue until one side has played all their balls, at which point, the opposing side will play their remaining balls. The balls can be moved with hands, feet, or, if the competitor’s disability is severe, with an assistive device such as a ramp. If both teams have the same amount of points after all ends have been played, one additional end is played to determine a winner. The number of ends and balls in each end depends on the side makeup. Individual competition consists of four ends and six balls per player per end, whilst paired competition is four ends and six balls per pair per end (three per player). The surface of the court is flat and smooth. On the court is a V-shaped line over which the jack must cross for the throw to be valid. BC1 – Players in this class throw the ball with the hand or foot. They may compete with an assistant who stays outside of the competitor’s playing box, to stabilize or adjust their playing chair and give the ball to the player when requested. The classification system allows riders to compete against others with a similar level of function. This is an adaptation of football for athletes with visual impairments. Teams have five players, including the goalkeeper. The ball is equipped with a noise-making device to allow players to locate it by sound. Three classes of athletes – B1 (totally or almost totally bind) and B2&B3 (partially sighted). Goalball is a team sport designed for blind athletes. Participants compete in teams of three, and try to throw a ball that has bells embedded in it into the opponents’ goal. Teams alternate throwing or rolling the ball from one end of the playing area to the other, and players remain in the area of their own goal in both defence and attack. Players must use the sound of the bell to judge the position and movement of the ball. Blindfolds allow partially sighted players to compete on an equal footing with blind players. Paralympic judo is an adaptation of the Japanese martial art of judo for visually impaired competitors. Single shells for the Arms and Shoulders category must have stabilising pontoons attached to the riggers. There are adaptations like the use of a shooting chair for competitors unable to stand, also a shooting table for events like kneeling or prone. Significant differences include the starting position and adaptations allowed for visually impaired swimmers. Competitors may start a race by standing on a platform and diving into the pool, as in able-bodied swimming, or by sitting on the platform and diving in, or they may start the race in the water. In events for the blind and visually impaired, people called “tappers” stand at the end of the pool and use a pole to tap the swimmers when they approach the wall, indicating when the swimmer should turn or end the race. Paralympic table tennis is asport which follows the standard rules with slight modifications for wheelchair athletes. Class 1-5 are for those in wheelchairs and class 6-10 for those who\n\n American football evolved from the sports of rugby and soccer. Rugby, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points. They consisted of 25 players per team and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the objective being to advance it into the opponent's goal. It has been suggested that this may have influenced New Zealand playing styles, especially amongst the indigenous population. It played by its own rules for many years. He \n\n kicked from behind the goal line. The ball had to be thrown in at right-angles to the touchline (as today in rugby union). ; There was no corner-kick. When the ball went behind the goal-line, there was a situation somewhat similar to rugby: if an attacking player first touched the ball after it went out of play, then the attacking team had an opportunity to take a free kick at goal from a point fifteen yards behind the point where \n\n In New Zealand there are 520 clubs, 141,726 registered players and 2309 referees.

Liverpool's importance was such that it was home to a number of world firsts, including gaining the world's first fully electrically powered overhead railway, the Liverpool Overhead Railway, which was opened in 1893 and so pre-dated those in both New York City and Chicago. Between 1851 and 1911, Liverpool attracted at least 20,000 people from Wales in each decade, peaking in the 1880s, and Welsh culture flourished. Early regular scheduled Liverpool transatlantic passenger travel began in the 1810s with American lines such as Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet) and Collins Line and in the 1840s with Liverpool-based companies' lines Cunard Line and White Star Line continuing throughout the 19th Century.

Eat foods at room temperature. Try soft foods such as soups, smoothies, yogurt, hot cereals, casseroles, eggs, tender meats, and well-cooked and mashed fruits and vegetables. When necessary, use pureed foods for the smoothest texture possible. Use sauces, liquid, broth, or gravy to soften food. Drink high-calorie shakes or smoothies that are homemade (with protein powder, milk, soy milk, or rice milk, nut butter, yogurt, and/or flavorful fruits). Use ice chips, sugarless gums, and sucking candies to moisten your mouth. Use a small, soft-bristle toothbrush to brush your teeth and tongue gently after each meal and at bedtime. If red meat tastes strange, replace it with chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, or tofu. Eat foods that smell and look good to you, but avoid favorite foods on the day of or days around your treatment. If you do not have any mouth soreness and foods lack taste or taste like “cardboard,” season foods with tart flavors, such as lemon, citrus, vinegar, pickled, or spicy ingredients. Avoid using metal utensils; use plastic utensils instead. If you do not have any mouth soreness, add extra flavor to foods with spices such as onion, garlic, chili powder, basil, oregano, rosemary, tarragon, barbecue sauce, mustard, ketchup, or mint. Avoid hot foods; serve food at room temperature. Try adding sweetening agents such as sugar, maple syrup, agave syrup, or honey to help enhance the taste. Rinse your mouth four times a day using a baking soda mixture (1 quart water, 1 tsp baking soda, and ¾ tsp salt) after meals. (Baking soda reduces the acidity of saliva, thins mucus, and discourages growth of yeast.) DO NOT SWALLOW. To prevent bacteria growth dry your toothbrush before putting it away. Avoid foods that are spicy, acidic and rough, or coarse in texture. Choose foods that are soft and easy to chew, such as soups, smoothies, yogurt, hot cereals, casseroles, eggs, tender meats, and well-cooked and mashed fruits and vegetables. Use sauces, liquid, or gravy to moisten food. Consume foods at room temperature. Eat meals that are high in protein/calories or add an oral nutritional beverage. Avoid greasy, spicy foods and foods with strong odors. Eat foods such as crackers, toast, or broth, all of which may be easier on your stomach. Avoid foods high in fiber, greasy or fatty foods, raw vegetables, caffeine, alcohol and sorbitol or other sugar-alcohol containing products. Limit dairy products if you’re lactose intolerant. Eat foods high in pectin and foods that easily dissolve in your mouth, such as applesauce, rice, bananas, and oatmeal. Consuming warm liquids may help to stimulate a bowel movement. Adding prune juice, hot lemon water, coffee or tea into your daily routine could help stimulate the bowels. If gas is a concern, limit gas-producing foods and drinks, such as carbonated beverages, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, peas, beans, onions, and raw peppers. Also, try drinking through a straw and cut down on chewing gum to limit swallowing air. Add extra butter, oil, mayonnaise, sauces, dressing, gravy, honey, jam, cheese, and nuts to your meals to increase calories. Dried milk powder mixed into gravies, soups, and sauces can also add more protein. Make mealtime enjoyable: invite friends or family over or play relaxing music. When you have acid reflux and stomach ulcers, there are certain foods you should avoid to help manage your symptoms. Some of the foods to limit or avoid include:\n\n1. Spicy foods: Spicy foods can irritate the lining of the stomach and aggravate acid reflux symptoms. It is best to avoid foods like chili peppers, hot sauces, and spicy seasonings. Acidic foods: Acidic foods can contribute to increased stomach acid production and worsen acid reflux. Examples of acidic foods to avoid include citrus fruits, tomatoes, and onions. Fatty and fried foods: High-fat and fried foods can slow down digestion and increase the risk of acid reflux. It is recommended to avoid foods like french fries, fatty cuts of meat, and full-fat dairy products. Alcohol: Alcohol can irritate the stomach lining and increase acid production. It is best to limit or avoid alcohol, especially if you have acid reflux or stomach ulcers. Chocolate and mint: Chocolate and mint can relax the lower esophageal sphincter and aggravate acid reflux symptoms. If possible, it is recommended to avoid these foods. Chelating agents are often broader in scope than the acute target, and therefore their ingestion necessitates careful medical or veterinarian supervision. Pesticides are one group of substances whose toxicity to various insects and other animals deemed to be pests (e.g., rats and cockroaches) is their prime purpose. Natural pesticides have been used for this purpose for thousands of years (e.g. concentrated table salt is toxic to many slugs). Bioaccumulation of chemically-prepared agricultural insecticides is a matter of concern for the many species, especially birds, which consume insects as a primary food source. Selective toxicity, controlled application, and \n\n of the weight of the individuals and perform important roles in the digestion of lignocellulose and nitrogen fixation. These communities are host-specific, and closely related insect species share comparable similarities in gut microbiota composition. In cockroaches, gut microbiota have been shown to assemble in a deterministic fashion, irrespective of the inoculum; the reason for this host-specific assembly remains unclear. Bacterial communities associated with insects like termites and cockroaches are determined by a combination of forces, primarily diet, but there is some indication that host phylogeny may also be playing a role in the selection of lineages. Meat is a rich source of sulfur which can change the pH of your blood. Same impact is observed in case of fried foods, sour and spicy foods. Meat contains the heaviest acid load due to its rich sulfur contents, which increases the acidity of blood leading to the demineralization of bones. Fried, oily and spicy foods, excessive meats and refined foods like confectionery products, sweets, bread and other refined wheat products are the main incriminating factors in the joint diseases. The kind of food leads to excess acid load in the blood, in which the kidneys are unable to cope with. In contrast, vegetarian diet, which contains predominantly uncooked food doesn’t have this disadvantage. However, spicy, fried foods and excessively sour foods-whether vegetarian or non-vegetarian are detrimental to bone, joint integrity and cartilage. It’s not true in case of a lacto vegetarian because milk and other dairy products are a rich source of calcium. However, there are many reports that describe as age advances the digestion of milk becomes more and more difficult owing to decreased gastric acid and enzyme contents. Cottage cheese (also known as clabbered milk or paneer) and whey (the water obtained during the preparation of cottage cheese) are the excellent sources of calcium for vegetarians and are much less toxic than the non-vegetarian sources of protein. D. Excessive use of common salt, coffee, tobacco, alcohol and soft drinks containing phosphorus. Vitamin C, D, phosphorus, calcium and protein intake is also useful. Avoid coffee, red meat and white potatoes as they increase acid load in the body. Add more bitter vegetables like bitter gourd and drum stick in your daily routine diet.\n\nQuestion: What won't a cockroach eat?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Green and white tea contains an abundant amount of polyphenols (which are antioxidant plant elements that have health benefits). The University of Maryland Center says that green tea can help stop the spreading of cancer cells in many forms of the disease, including breast, prostate, esophageal, and stomach. The medical center also says that green tea shows results in preventing atherosclerosis and high cholesterol, which both have the ability to change to heart disease. As for white tea it has great advantages over cancer versus green tea. Studies from Linus Pauling Institute in 2000 performed test on four types of white tea on rats to study their benefits on colon cancer protection. White tea has higher content of polyphenols than green tea. White tea has a group of antioxidants that are proven to reduce cholesterol, decrease blood pressure, repair vein tissue, and general cardiovascular function. The antioxidants of white tea help boost the immune system in both humans and animals. White tea can also thin the blood and improve artery function which in turn is good against high blood pressure. It has also been proven that adding a lemon, soy sauce, or rice milk to green tea greatly enhances the body’s absorption of its antioxidants. Green tea has been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years, starting in China but used widely throughout Asia, this amazing beverage has many uses ranging from diet - weightloss, IBS, to lowering blood pressure, according to the experts. Diabetes – Green tea can help regulate body glucose levels, potentially preventing high insulin levels. The polyphenol, found in green tea can intensify the levels of fat oxidation and the rate at which your body can turn food into calories. Esophageal Cancer – Green Tea can potentially reduce the risk of esophageal cancer, and it is widely thought to kill cancer cells in general without damaging the healthy tissue around them. Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s – Green Tea is said to help delay the deterioration caused by Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. Tooth Decay – Studies have suggested that catechin in green tea can destroy bacteria and viruses that cause throat infections, dental caries and other dental conditions. What sets green tea apart is apparently the way it is processed. Green tea leaves are typically steamed, which prevents the EGCG compound from being oxidized. In contrast, black and oolong tea leaves are made typically from fermented leaves, that results in the EGCG being converted into other compounds, that are not as effective in disease prevention. Tea is a beverage made by steeping processed leaves, buds, or twigs of the plant Camellia sinensis in hot water for a few minutes. There are four main types of tea: black, oolong, green, and white. Tea is a natural source of caffeine, theophylline, theanine, and antioxidants; but it has almost no fat, carbohydrates, or protein Tea has been consumed in China for around 5,000 years. **Benefits**\n\nTea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.This allows natural enzymes in the tea leaves to produce the characteristic red-brown colour and reduced astringency.Grapeseed oil also has beneficial properties and taking 30 ml daily can both increase levels of beneficial HDL cholesterol (which protects against coronary heart disease), and reduce triglyceride levels by around 15 per cent within one month. **Green tea**\n\nGreen and black tea are similar in that both are made from the young leaves and leaf buds of the same shrub, _Camellia sinensis_. sinensis sinensis_ ) and the large-leaved Assam tea plant ( _C. sinensis assamica_ ). **Benefits**\n\nTea is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and its origins date back to ancient China where legend claims tea was introduced as a beverage in 2737 BC when leaves from a camellia bush fell into the emperor's cup of hot water.These are converted into less active antioxidants (such as theaflavins and thearubigins) during fermentation but even so, drinking four to five cups of black tea per day still provides over 50 per cent of the total dietary intake of flavonoid antioxidants (other sources include fruit and vegetables especially apples and onions). Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects.Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure.It is also used to promote mental alertness, protect against solar radiation, improve dental health, and prevent aging.There is a concern that adding stevia to beverages such as colas could expose consumers to high doses of stevia, because consumers may drink large quantities. The tea plant is a member of the Theaceae family. Three types of tea—oolong, black, and green—are produced from the leaves of the tea plant, depending on the processing technique. Oolong and green tea are closely related and have been used medicinally for a variety of conditions, including diabetes. USES\n\nMedicinally, tea is used to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease, cancer, and obesity. Green tea has been used to treat high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Tea contains polyphenols, chemicals that can have anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and antioxidant effects. Tea also contains caffeine, which may increase or decrease blood glucose and blood pressure.Although closely related, oolong and green tea differ in their caffeine and polyphenol content.Recent evidence indicates that regularly drinking six or more cups a day of green tea may lower your risk of developing of type 2 diabetes.Some of the ingredients in tea are thought to enhance insulin activity, which may be responsible for some of the benefit in diabetes.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name given to tea?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
