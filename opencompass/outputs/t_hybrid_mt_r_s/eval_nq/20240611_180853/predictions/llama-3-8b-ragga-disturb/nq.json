Variolinum, the homeopathic preparation or nosode of smallpox, provides an early example of HP. This study proved, once again, that HP provides over 90% protection against disease, as opposed to the 63% effectiveness of traditional vaccines. HP has effectively prevented Japanese Encephalitis in India, Dengue fever in Brazil, Leptospirosis in Cuba, and Polio in the United States and Argentina. Since 1985, Dr. Golden has studied the effectiveness of HP in nearly 3,000 children. He has evaluated HP’s effectiveness in disease prevention, as well as how it compares with conventional methods of vaccination, in order to determine how children’s health would fare overall. In addition to not getting the diseases to which the HP nosodes correspond, these children had fewer subsequent health and behavioral problems. Similar to someone who survived these diseases in childhood, one who follows the HP protocol allows their immune system to “think” it has moved through each disease, thereby acquiring natural immunity. Unlike someone who had the disease, however, the person taking HP does not suffer from the effects. “We have trained 192 HP supervisors in North America and around the world,” says Birch, explaining that 96 of those trained currently act as HP supervisors with FHCi, and that 20 of those active supervisors live outside North America.

The lack of championships was sometimes attributed in jest to the Curse of Billy Penn after One Liberty Place became the first building to surpass the height of the William Penn statue on top of City Hall's tower in 1987. After nine years passed without another championship, the Eagles won their first Super Bowl following the 2017 season. Though the Eagles had a big 56–21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During Sunday Night Football on NBC that week, Keith Olbermann named the Philadelphia Eagles the \"Worst Persons in the NFL\" for their blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing \"Throwbacks? The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of Philadelphia, were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct Frankford Yellowjackets franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre-Jeffrey Lurie era kelly green was introduced.

He planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces, public parks, and six radial boulevards, 120 ft wide, extending from the center. He envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 50,000 people, linked by road and rail. His model for a garden city was first created at Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. He renamed it Chetwynd House and when he married his star designer Clarice Cliff in 1940, she moved into the house and lived there until 1972. In 1902 Parker and Unwin were asked to design a model village at New Earswick near York for Joseph and Benjamin Seebohm Rowntree, and the following year they were given the opportunity to take part in the creation of\n\n"

Gallstone ileus is a rare form of small bowel obstruction caused by an impaction of a gallstone within the lumen of the small intestine. Such a gallstone enters the bowel via a cholecysto-enteric fistula. The presence of large stones, >2.5 cm in diameter, within the gallbladder are thought to predispose to fistula formation by gradual erosion through the gallbladder fundus. Once a fistula has formed, a stone may travel from the gallbladder into the bowel and become lodged almost anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. Rarely, gallstone ileus may recur if the underlying fistula is not treated. First described by Thomas Bartholin in 1654, the name \"gallstone ileus\" is a misnomer because an ileus is, by definition, a non-mechanical bowel motility failure (as opposed to a mechanical obstruction by a stone).

The most common problem with the gall bladder is gallstones. It has been shown that proper levels of calcium, magnesium and vitamin C in the body are important in keeping the gall bladder working properly. When the gall bladder accumulates a number of stones, they can either be passed without notice or get stuck. It has been found that elective surgery to remove a gall bladder that has had frequent gallstone attacks is actually more dangerous than waiting for the rare situation where there is an emergency. Pain in the upper abdomen or on the right shoulder blade can signal a problem with the gall bladder. One of the best things to do if you suspect a gallstone has become stuck is to apply a simple castor oil compress to the right side of the abdomen.

Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. It also ranks 16th in oil reserves. The cartel preceded easily by three decades the birth of another cartel, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which was formed in 1960. On 11 December 2009, Russia's Energy Minister Sergey Shmatko stated: \"Today we can speak about gas OPEC as a fully fledged international organization. This is to show that member countries expect \n\n economies; costing and mismanagement problems in agricultural, manufacturing, and other sectors meant the failure of many projects. Arab OPEC member countries opposed Israel during the Yom Kippur War of October 1973. OPEC embargoed oil exports to many Western governments as retaliation for their having supported Israel in the War. 40 African countries were dependent upon oil imports from OPEC, and when the price of oil rose rapidly from the embargo, African exports became too expensive for many foreign markets.\n\n"

It stars Shailene Woodley, Theo James, Ashley Judd, Jai Courtney, Ray Stevenson, Zoë Kravitz, Miles Teller, Tony Goldwyn, Ansel Elgort, Maggie Q, and Kate Winslet. Development of Divergent began in March 2011 when Summit \n\n Summit Entertainment had bought the rights to film an adaptation of the novel and recruited Neil Burger to direct, with Shailene Woodley starring as Beatrice \"Tris\" Prior and Theo James as Tobias \"Four\" Eaton. Divergent was released on March 21, 2014. The adaptation of Allegiant was split into two parts; the first part, Allegiant, was released on March 18, 2016, while the second part, titled Ascendant, was originally planned to be released in June 2017. On May 7, 2013, Summit Entertainment revealed that a sequel based on Insurgent was in the works. The sequel was released on March 20, 2015. The third film, based on the novel Allegiant, was initially announced as a single film scheduled for release on March 18, 2016. Divergent was released on March 21, 2014, in the United States. The film received mixed reviews: although its action sequences and performances, notably Woodley's, were praised, critics deemed its execution and handling of its themes to be generic and unoriginal, and compared it unfavorably to other young adult fiction adaptations. A sequel, Insurgent, was released on March 20, 2015, in the United States and other countries. A third film, Allegiant, was released on March 18, 2016.\n\n"

Anne and her husband, Prince George Oldenburg of Denmark, experienced a total of seventeen pregnancies from 1684 to 1700. Among the children they lost were: a stillborn daughter in 1684, Mary Oldenburg in 1685 who died at the age of 2, Anne Sophia Oldenburg in 1686 who died in infancy, a stillborn child in 1687, a stillborn son in 1687, a stillborn child in 1688, William Henry Oldenburg, Duke of Gloucester, in 1689 who lived until the age of 11, Mary Oldenburg in 1690 who died as an infant, George Oldenburg in 1692 who died as an infant, a stillborn daughter in 1693, stillborn sons and daughters in 1694, 1695, 1696, 1697, and 1698. The complications and losses during Anne's pregnancies and the high mortality rate among her children had a profound impact on the Stuart dynasty. As a result, there was no Stuart heir to continue the dynasty. These losses paved the way for the Hanoverian succession, with George I of the House of Hanover, a German royal, ascending to the throne after Queen Anne's death. It is worth noting that Anne's longest-surviving child, William, suffered from infantile seizures, childhood dyskinesias, and gross hydrocephalus. In summary, Queen Anne Stuart's pregnancies were plagued by complications and led to numerous losses and children with health issues. These complications and losses ultimately impacted the Stuart dynasty by allowing the Hanoverians to take over the throne. Year 654, Queen Jindeok died without a successor. Monarch – Elizabeth II \n\n Throughout the Konbaung dynasty, the royal family performed ancestral rites to honour their immediate ancestors. Upon her husband's accession to the Perak throne on 3 February 1984, she became Raja Permaisuri of Perak with the title of Tuanku. Sultan Azlan Shah was selected as the ninth Yang di-Pertuan Agong and during the Oath Taking and Signing Ceremony on 26 April 1989, Tuanku Bainun was proclaimed Raja Permaisuri Agong. They held these titles until the end of Azlan Shah's term on 25 April 1994. She ceased to be Raja Permaisuri of Perak on 28 May 2014, after her husband died.

The sperm tail is a classic flagellum (Chapter 12), producing whipping or lashing movements via adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis that propels the sperm through the female reproductive organs toward the egg. Once a sperm reaches the egg, it binds to the outer layer and then attempts to penetrate the hard **zona pellucida**. Upon reaching the **corona radiata** layer of the egg, the **acrosome** , a cap-like structure at the tip of each sperm, releases the enzyme **hyaluronidase** , which breaks down hyaluronic acid contained in the presenting egg layer. Next, the enzyme **acrosin** digests the zona pellucida and promotes changes in the structure and fluidity of the membranes of the sperm tip and the egg to cause them to fuse. Following this initial fusion process, a protein molecule on the sperm acrosome binds to a directly interlocking protein, **ZP3** , on the egg. Fusion of the fertilizing sperm and egg results in haploid nuclei.The binding of sperm to egg results in a release of calcium ions, which promote fusion of cortical granule membranes with the egg's plasma membrane.Fusion expresses factors that cause the release of an externally bound, membrane protein on the outer **vitelline layer** of the egg. During sperm-egg binding, the fusion of plasma membranes involves several components. The sperm contains three ADAM proteins: fertilin α, fertilin β, and cyritestin. These proteins are believed to play a role in the interaction between the sperm and egg. The materials released by the acrosome reaction include hydrolytic enzymes such as the serine protease, acrosin, that help digest a path through the zona and enables the sperm to reach the egg surface. The sperm–egg recognition is carried out by ADAM proteins on the sperm, which bind to integrins on the egg surface. The sperm contains three ADAM proteins: fertilin α, fertilin β, and cyritestin. The binding of sperm to egg is the first stage in fusion of the plasma membranes, which occurs at a domain on the side of the sperm head. In mammals, the sperm binds to microvilli on the egg surface, and sperm-egg membrane fusion first occurs around the equatorial region of the sperm head12. The fused membrane is then disrupted, and the sperm nucleus as well as the cytoplasm is incorporated into the egg. Sperm-egg binding was normal, but sperm-egg fusion was almost entirely inhibited in eggs from Cd9 females. Release of this protein forces the vitelline layer away from the zona pellucida, moving any other sperm away permanently and inhibiting any other sperm from fertilizing the egg.Fusion expresses factors that cause the release of an externally bound, membrane protein on the outer **vitelline layer** of the egg.As discussed in Chapters 1 and , this process relies on the structural proteins tubulin–microtubules and their interaction with the motor protein, dynein. Once a sperm reaches the egg, it binds to the outer layer and then attempts to penetrate the hard **zona pellucida**. Upon reaching the **corona radiata** layer of the egg, the **acrosome** , a cap-like structure at the tip of each sperm, releases the enzyme **hyaluronidase** , which breaks down hyaluronic acid contained in the presenting egg layer. Next, the enzyme **acrosin** digests the zona pellucida and promotes changes in the structure and fluidity of the membranes of the sperm tip and the egg to cause them to fuse.

        "context": "Fusion of the fertilizing sperm and egg results in haploid nuclei.This binding is believed to initiate a series of reactions, including the **acrosome reaction** , a release of enzymes by the acrosome, which complete the membrane fusion; the **cortical reaction** (see below); and activation of the egg to undergo a second meiotic division.### **FERTILIZATION**\n\nThe process of fertilization, the entrance of a sperm cell or, in rare cases, sperm cells into an egg, relies on several fundamental biochemical processes, including cell motility and plasma membrane fusion, involving changing fluidity and structure of the sperm and egg membranes (Chapter 8, Figure 20-7). ** Steps of fertilization are indicated, including the acrosomal reaction (see text). The sperm tail is a classic flagellum (Chapter 12), producing whipping or lashing movements via adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis that propels the sperm through the female reproductive organs toward the egg. Once a sperm reaches the egg, it binds to the outer layer and then attempts to penetrate the hard **zona pellucida**. Upon reaching the **corona radiata** layer of the egg, the **acrosome** , a cap-like structure at the tip of each sperm, releases the enzyme **hyaluronidase** , which breaks down hyaluronic acid contained in the presenting egg layer. Next, the enzyme **acrosin** digests the zona pellucida and promotes changes in the structure and fluidity of the membranes of the sperm tip and the egg to cause them to fuse. Following this initial fusion process, a protein molecule on the sperm acrosome binds to a directly interlocking protein, **ZP3** , on the egg. Fusion of the fertilizing sperm and egg results in haploid nuclei.The binding of sperm to egg results in a release of calcium ions, which promote fusion of cortical granule membranes with the egg's plasma membrane.Fusion expresses factors that cause the release of an externally bound, membrane protein on the outer **vitelline layer** of the egg. During sperm-egg binding, the fusion of plasma membranes involves several components. The sperm contains three ADAM proteins: fertilin α, fertilin β, and cyritestin. These proteins are believed to play a role in the interaction between the sperm and egg. The materials released by the acrosome reaction include hydrolytic enzymes such as the serine protease, acrosin, that help digest a path through the zona and enables the sperm to reach the egg surface. The sperm–egg recognition is carried out by ADAM proteins on the sperm, which bind to integrins on the egg surface. The sperm contains three ADAM proteins: fertilin α, fertilin β, and cyritestin. The binding of sperm to egg is the first stage in fusion of the plasma membranes, which occurs at a domain on the side of the sperm head. In mammals, the sperm binds to microvilli on the egg surface, and sperm-egg membrane fusion first occurs around the equatorial region of the sperm head12. The fused membrane is then disrupted, and the sperm nucleus as well as the cytoplasm is incorporated into the egg. Sperm-egg binding was normal, but sperm-egg fusion was almost entirely inhibited in eggs from Cd9 females. Release of this protein forces the vitelline layer away from the zona pellucida, moving any other sperm away permanently and inhibiting any other sperm from fertilizing the egg.Fusion expresses factors that cause the release of an externally bound, membrane protein on the outer **vitelline layer** of the egg.As discussed in Chapters 1 and , this process relies on the structural proteins tubulin–microtubules and their interaction with the motor protein, dynein. Once a sperm reaches the egg, it binds to the outer layer and then attempts to penetrate the hard **zona pellucida**. Upon reaching the **corona radiata** layer of the egg, the **acrosome** , a cap-like structure at the tip of each sperm, releases the enzyme **hyaluronidase** , which breaks down hyaluronic acid contained in the presenting egg layer. Next, the enzyme **acrosin** digests the zona pellucida and promotes changes in the structure and fluidity of the membranes of the sperm tip and the egg to cause them to fuse.

Reach out to a health-care provider as soon as possible.There is a lot of variance in what's considered a \"normal\" period, but menstrual cycles that come more frequently than twenty-one days apart, changes in flow, periods that stop altogether when a woman is not pregnant, heavier than normal flow, or bleeding between periods are possible signs of problems affecting the reproductive organs.Menstruation\n\nMenstruation, also known as a period, is the monthly vaginal bleeding that occurs when a woman's body sheds the inner lining of the uterus through her vagina. Most women begin menstruating between the ages of eight and fifteen (average age in the United States is twelve) and will continue menstruating for the next thirty to forty years until no longer able to reproduce, a process known as menopause. There are several different products women use during their periods. Menstrual pads are placed on panties and collect the fluid outside of the body. Menstrual cups are soft cups usually made of medical-grade silicone shaped like a bell. A normal menstrual cycle lasts between three to five days and occurs every twenty-one to thirty-five days in adults (twenty-one to forty-five days in young teens). Reach out to a health-care provider as soon as possible.Diaphragm\n\nA diaphragm is a dome-shaped (often silicone) cup inserted into the vagina, similar to a menstrual cup, where it covers the cervix.It can be placed in the vagina up to six hours before sex.For maximum efficacy, it is usually used in conjunction with spermicidal gel that should be reapplied (though the diaphragm does not need to be removed) in between sex acts. If a woman does not have menstrual pads available while menstruating, there are several alternatives she can consider. Although it may not provide the same level of absorbency and protection as menstrual pads, it can help manage the flow until more suitable products become available. They come in various sizes and absorbencies, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective option for managing menstrual flow. In addition, some women may choose to use period underwear or menstrual cups as alternatives to traditional menstrual pads. Period underwear is specially designed with built-in absorbent layers to prevent leaks, while menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood.

Most women begin menstruating between the ages of eight and fifteen (average age in the United States is twelve) and will continue menstruating for the next thirty to forty years until no longer able to reproduce, a process known as menopause. There are several different products women use during their periods. Menstrual pads are placed on panties and collect the fluid outside of the body. Menstrual cups are soft cups usually made of medical-grade silicone shaped like a bell.

If a woman does not have menstrual pads available while menstruating, there are several alternatives she can consider. Although it may not provide the same level of absorbency and protection as menstrual pads, it can help manage the flow until more suitable products become available. They come in various sizes and absorbencies, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective option for managing menstrual flow. In addition, some women may choose to use period underwear or menstrual cups as alternatives to traditional menstrual pads. Period underwear is specially designed with built-in absorbent layers to prevent leaks, while menstrual cups are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual blood.

Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued. The administration of vaccines subcutaneously is also associated with injection site reactions. Technique\n\nSubcutaneous injections are performed by cleaning the area to be injected followed by an injection, usually at a 45 -degree angle to the skin when using a syringe and needle, or at a 90-degree angle (perpendicular) if using an injector pen. The appropriate injection angle is based on the length of needle used, and the depth of the subcutaneous fat in the skin of the specific person. If administered at an angle, the skin and underlying tissue may be pinched upwards prior to injection. Subcutaneous injections can also be delivered via a pump system which uses a cannula inserted under the skin. Locations\n\nCommonly used injection sites include:\n The outer area of the upper arm. The choice of specific injection site is based on the medication being administered, with heparin almost always being administered in the abdomen, as well as preference. Injections administered frequently or repeatedly should be administered in a different location each time, either within the same general site or a different site, but at least one inch away from recent injections. Self-administration\nAs opposed to intramuscular or intravenous injections, subcutaneous injections can be easily performed by people with minor skill and training required. See also\n Intramuscular injection\n Intravenous injection\n Intradermal injection\n\nReferences\n\nDosage forms\nRoutes of administration\nInjection (medicine)\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered as a bolus into the subcutis, the layer of skin directly below the dermis and epidermis, collectively referred to as the cutis. Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ,  or subcut. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Medical uses\n\nA subcutaneous injection is administered into the fatty tissue of the subcutaneous tissue, located below the dermis and epidermis. A subcutaneous injection is absorbed slower than a substance injected intravenously or into a muscle, but faster than a medication administered by mouth. Medications\nMedications commonly administered via subcutaneous injection include insulin, monoclonal antibodies, and heparin. Subcutaneous injections can also be used when the increased bioavailability and more rapid effects over oral administration are preferred. They are also the easiest form of parenteral administration of medication to perform by lay people, and are associated with less adverse effects such as pain or infection than other forms of injection. Contraindications\nContraindications to subcutaneous injections primarily depend on the specific medication being administered. An injection should not be given at a specific site if there is inflammation or skin damage in the area. The most common adverse reactions after subcutaneous injections are administered are termed \"injection site reactions\". Injection site reactions may be minimized if repeated injections are necessary by moving the injection site at least one inch from previous injections, or using a different injection location altogether. This can lead to slower or incomplete absorption from the injection site. Rotating the injection site is the primary method of preventing changes in tissue structure from insulin administration. This is seen with the subcutaneous injection of triptans for migraine headache, medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception, as well as many monoclonal antibodies. In most cases, injection site reactions are self-limiting and resolve on their own after a short time without treatment, and do not require the medication to be discontinued.

The acid helps kill harmful viruses and bacteria present in the food and chemically breaks down the food into smaller molecules. After leaving the stomach, the partially digested food enters the small intestine. Juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder mix with the food to further process the nutrients. Throughout the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, there are muscles lining the walls. Overall, the digestive system relies on the coordinated actions of muscles, enzymes, and digestive juices to convert food into microscopic molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstreams and provide essential nutrients for our body's functions. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less \n\nHumans have a special digestive system that allows them to break down large food particles into smaller molecules and absorb the nutrients within the food.What are the major parts of the digestive system?It is lined mostly with smooth muscles (involuntary) that push the food through the tract in a process called peristalsis.What is dyslipidemia (or dyslipidaemia)? Because of its connection to fats and to being overweight or obese, dyslipidemia is often associated with people who have type 2 diabetes—and vice versa. HOW DIABETES AFFECTS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n\nWHAT IS DIGESTION? How does human digestion work? The purpose of digestion is to break down large food particles into smaller molecules that can be absorbed (as nutrients) and used by the cells of the body as a source of energy for growth and reproduction. The digestive tract, also called the alimentary canal, is approximately 30 feet (9 meters) long from the mouth to the anus. What are the major parts of the digestive system?

The acid helps kill harmful viruses and bacteria present in the food and chemically breaks down the food into smaller molecules. After leaving the stomach, the partially digested food enters the small intestine. Juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder mix with the food to further process the nutrients. Throughout the digestive tract, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine, there are muscles lining the walls. Overall, the digestive system relies on the coordinated actions of muscles, enzymes, and digestive juices to convert food into microscopic molecules that can be absorbed into our bloodstreams and provide essential nutrients for our body's functions. Normally the human gastrointestinal tract digests and absorbs dietary nutrients with remarkable efficiency. This massive load is reduced by the small and large intestines to less \n\nHumans have a special digestive system that allows them to break down large food particles into smaller molecules and absorb the nutrients within the food.What are the major parts of the digestive system?It is lined mostly with smooth muscles (involuntary) that push the food through the tract in a process called peristalsis.What is dyslipidemia (or dyslipidaemia)? Because of its connection to fats and to being overweight or obese, dyslipidemia is often associated with people who have type 2 diabetes—and vice versa. HOW DIABETES AFFECTS THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM\n\nWHAT IS DIGESTION? How does human digestion work? The purpose of digestion is to break down large food particles into smaller molecules that can be absorbed (as nutrients) and used by the cells of the body as a source of energy for growth and reproduction.

This is where most of the invertebrate unipolar neurons are found. Unipolar neurons in invertebrates have a single process called a neurite that extends from the cell body and then branches into dendritic and axonal processes. This is in contrast to vertebrates, where most neurons in the central nervous systems are multipolar, with multiple processes extending from the cell body. Examples of invertebrate unipolar neurons include most invertebrate sensory neurons and bipolar cells of the vertebrate retina. These pseudo-unipolar neurons have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia of the vertebrate spinal cord. They have a single axon and multiple dendrites emerging from the cell body. Multipolar neurons are found in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and are responsible for relaying touch, pressure, and pain sensations from the extremities to the spinal cord. Unipolar neurons are found throughout the central nervous system of invertebrates and in the autonomic nervous system of vertebrates.

This is where most of the invertebrate unipolar neurons are found. Unipolar neurons in invertebrates have a single process called a neurite that extends from the cell body and then branches into dendritic and axonal processes. This is in contrast to vertebrates, where most neurons in the central nervous systems are multipolar, with multiple processes extending from the cell body. Examples of invertebrate unipolar neurons include most invertebrate sensory neurons and bipolar cells of the vertebrate retina. These pseudo-unipolar neurons have their cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia of the vertebrate spinal cord. They have a single axon and multiple dendrites emerging from the cell body. Multipolar neurons are found in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and are responsible for relaying touch, pressure, and pain sensations from the extremities to the spinal cord. Unipolar neurons are found throughout the central nervous system of invertebrates and in the autonomic nervous system of vertebrates.

The mucous membrane of the lip may be erythematous (red) and granular. One or both lips may be affected. ; Oral ulceration (mouth ulcers) which may be aphthous like, or be more chronic and deep with raised margins. Alternatively, lesions similar to pyostomatitis vegetans may occur in OFG, but this is uncommon. ; \"Full width\" gingivitis (compare with marginal gingivitis). ; Gingival enlargement (swelling of the gums). ; Fissured tongue (grooves in the tongue). ; Enlargement of \n\nThere are many changes in the body that can never be aware of. - Language Color white surface: The language that suddenly surface to the white color means you have a yeast infection – fungal species oral (mouth), according to Dr. Bruce Robinson of the American Academy of Dermatology. The mouth has a role in maintaining the balance of good bacteria, but when a foreign object, such as antibiotics, in the mouth, the bacteria become grown out of control, covering the surface of the tongue. - Inflammation of the gums: When the gums are inflamed, then you go to a dental clinic, dentist at the clinic can be the first to know if you are pregnant. ”Swollen gums is one of the side effects of the first appearance of the hormonal changes of pregnancy,” said Sassan Rastegar, a dentist in New York. - Cracked corner of mouth (injury): According to Dr. Wilma Bergfeld, a dermatologist at the Cleveland Clinic, if the corners of the mouth, causing sores developing cracks, it indicates that you are deficient in vitamin A and B - especially B2, B6 and folic acid – can cause the skin around the corners of the mouth becomes dry and sensitive that arise when cracks at the tip of your lips.Suggestions to overcome them, according to Dr. Vandana Y.Bhide, an internal medicine specialist, is to increase consumption of foods such as green vegetables and watermelons. Nasal congestion caused by allergies, can dilate blood vessels and darken around the eyes and nose. Because, according to dr. Dina D.Strachan, a New York dermatologist, it could be a “melasma”, a condition, benign, which is often associated with contraceptive use.Doctors do not know why some birth control pills can cause brown spots on the head, cheek or upper lip, be careful with exposure to UV light, being able mebuat brown spots are getting worse. - Small bump Color Yellow experts in internal medicine at New York, dr. Svetlana Kogan said that the emergence of small yellow lumps in your body is caused by deposits of fat high cholesterol.These small bumps may appear yellowish anywhere, but occurs most often in the knees, elbows, hands and feet. - Rash on the buttocks The emergence of a rash on the buttocks is celiac disease, caused by food containing gluten (gluten). Celiac disease provides a red itchy rash or blisters on the buttocks, but in the buttocks, skin rashes and blisters also occur on the elbows and knees. Cover the mouth when hands Startled, Why? 7 Home Remedies for Angular Cheilitis That Work a Treat! I have really bad cracks/split lips in the corners of my mouth & they are incredibly painful. Angular cheilitis (also known as perleche, angular stomatitis, cracks in the corners of the mouth, cracked lip corners & corner of mouth sores) is mainly caused by a fungal infection, normally candida albicans. If you regularly get cracks in the corners of your mouth then you will usually also suffer with yeast infections as the two go hand in hand in most cases. A bacterial infection can also cause angular cheilitis. When saliva gets trapped in the corners of the mouth, it eventually dries & causes the skin to crack. The warmth & moisture in the corners of the mouth then create a perfect environment for fungus or bacteria to grow & multiply. Symptoms of angular cheilitis include soreness, irritation & inflammation in the corner(s) of the mouth. In many cases, your lips will feel like they're on fire, especially you continue to lick them (which is the worst thing you can do). Natural Treatment for Cracked Lip Sores #1... Yogurt: Because angular cheilitis is primarily caused by a yeast infection (candida), it makes sense that yogurt, which is one of the standard treatments for yeast infections, would also work for cracks in the corners of the mouth. Simply apply some natural yogurt to your angular cheilitis with a q-tip & leave on. Continue to do this as many times as you can throughout the day, especially before bedtime, & you'll find your mouth sore(s) either gone overnight or very close to being healed. Home Remedy for Angular Cheilitis #2... Coconut Oil: Organic coconut oil is a powerful anti-fungal & antibacterial agent. Coconut oil is also an excellent moisturizer, so it helps soothe & moisturize your cracked lip corners. Natural Remedy for Corner of Mouth Sores #3... B Complex, Zinc & Iron: B vitamins are essential for the normal growth, repair and development of skin & connective tissue, mucous membranes & immune response. Apply a small amount of either to your cracked lip corners 3-4 times daily. Aloe vera contains potent anti-fungal, antiseptic & anti-inflammatory properties & is great for relieving the pain & inflammation associated with cracked lip sores. Refrigerate for about an hour then apply to the cracked & dry corners of your mouth. Then using a Q-tip, apply the milk of magnesia to your cracked lip corners. Take a teaspoon of MSM biological sulphur (a safe mineral supplement) every day to prevent the re-occurrence of angular cheilitis. - Avoid refined sugars: Yeast fungus feeds off sugar so cut this additive out of your diet. - Avoid licking your lips as much as possible.\n\nQuestion: what causes cracked skin at the corners of your mouth\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Cover the mouth when hands Startled, Why? 7 Home Remedies for Angular Cheilitis That Work a Treat! I have really bad cracks/split lips in the corners of my mouth & they are incredibly painful. Angular cheilitis (also known as perleche, angular stomatitis, cracks in the corners of the mouth, cracked lip corners & corner of mouth sores) is mainly caused by a fungal infection, normally candida albicans. If you regularly get cracks in the corners of your mouth then you will usually also suffer with yeast infections as the two go hand in hand in most cases. A bacterial infection can also cause angular cheilitis. When saliva gets trapped in the corners of the mouth, it eventually dries & causes the skin to crack. The warmth & moisture in the corners of the mouth then create a perfect environment for fungus or bacteria to grow & multiply. Symptoms of angular cheilitis include soreness, irritation & inflammation in the corner(s) of the mouth. In many cases, your lips will feel like they're on fire, especially you continue to lick them (which is the worst thing you can do). Natural Treatment for Cracked Lip Sores #1... Yogurt: Because angular cheilitis is primarily caused by a yeast infection (candida), it makes sense that yogurt, which is one of the standard treatments for yeast infections, would also work for cracks in the corners of the mouth. Simply apply some natural yogurt to your angular cheilitis with a q-tip & leave on. Continue to do this as many times as you can throughout the day, especially before bedtime, & you'll find your mouth sore(s) either gone overnight or very close to being healed. Home Remedy for Angular Cheilitis #2... Coconut Oil: Organic coconut oil is a powerful anti-fungal & antibacterial agent. Coconut oil is also an excellent moisturizer, so it helps soothe & moisturize your cracked lip corners. Natural Remedy for Corner of Mouth Sores #3... B Complex, Zinc & Iron: B vitamins are essential for the normal growth, repair and development of skin & connective tissue, mucous membranes & immune response. Apply a small amount of either to your cracked lip corners 3-4 times daily. Aloe vera contains potent anti-fungal, antiseptic & anti-inflammatory properties & is great for relieving the pain & inflammation associated with cracked lip sores. Refrigerate for about an hour then apply to the cracked & dry corners of your mouth. Then using a Q-tip, apply the milk of magnesia to your cracked lip corners. Take a teaspoon of MSM biological sulphur (a safe mineral supplement) every day to prevent the re-occurrence of angular cheilitis. - Avoid refined sugars: Yeast fungus feeds off sugar so cut this additive out of your diet. - Avoid licking your lips as much as possible.\n\n"

Physiology \n\nAfter death, aerobic respiration in an organism ceases, depleting the source of oxygen used in the making of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is required to cause separation of the actin-myosin cross-bridges during relaxation of muscle. When oxygen is no longer present, the body may continue to produce ATP via anaerobic glycolysis. When the body's glycogen is depleted, the ATP concentration diminishes, and the body enters rigor mortis because it is unable to break those bridges. In rigor mortis myosin heads continue binding with the active sites of actin proteins via adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and the muscle is unable to relax until further enzyme activity degrades the complex. However, as ATP is absent, there must be a breakdown of muscle tissue by enzymes (endogenous or bacterial) during decomposition. As part of the process of decomposition, the myosin heads are degraded by the enzymes, allowing the muscle contraction to release and the body to relax. Decomposition of the myofilaments occurs between 48 and 60 hours after the peak of rigor mortis, which occurs approximately 13 hours after death. All muscles in the body are affected. The sequence may be due to different lactic acid levels among different muscles, which is directly related to the difference in glycogen levels and different types of muscle fibers. Rigor mortis may not be perceivable in many infant and child corpses due to their smaller muscle mass. Applications in meat industry \nRigor mortis is very important in the meat industry. The onset of rigor mortis and its resolution partially determines the tenderness of meat. If the post-slaughter meat is immediately chilled to 15 °C (59 °F), a phenomenon known as cold shortening occurs, whereby the muscle sarcomeres shrink to a third of their original length. To prevent cold shortening, a process known as electrical stimulation is carried out, especially in beef carcasses, immediately after slaughter and skinning. In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

In this process, the carcass is stimulated with alternating current, causing it to contract and relax, which depletes the ATP reserve from the carcass and prevents cold shortening. Several factors impact its progression, and investigators take these into account when estimating the time of death. One such factor is the ambient temperature. In warm environments, the onset and pace of rigor mortis are sped up by providing a conducive environment for the metabolic processes that cause decay.

Cellular respiration is an extremely important topic; free-response questions about respiration frequently appear on the AP exam. The chemical equation describing this process is\n\nC6H12O6 \\+ 6 O2 → 6 CO2 \\+ 6 H2O + energy\n\nC6H12O6 is glucose. Cellular respiration in the presence of O2 is called **aerobic respiration. ** Aerobic respiration is divided into three components: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation. Refer to Figure 4-1 as you read the following descriptions of the metabolic processes. ** The first several steps require the input of energy. This changes glucose in preparation for subsequent steps. **The Krebs Cycle**\n\nThe Krebs cycle details what happens to pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis.Although the Krebs cycle is described for 1 pyruvate, remember that glycolysis produces 2 pyruvate.

The dephosphorylation of ATP and rephosphorylation of ADP and AMP occur repeatedly in the course of aerobic metabolism.

Waste heat recovered from industrial operations (0.5%) and petroleum-fired peaker plants (0.1%) generated the remainder. Coal previously generated 81% of Utah's electricity in 2013, and has been undergoing a gradual replacement with natural gas and renewables. higher carbon density than Wyoming coal, so less of it has to be burned to produce the same amount of electricity, thus producing less per capita carbon dioxide emissions. The Western Coalfield has been hit much harder by acid rain regulations. Whereas about half of Eastern coal is high in sulfur content, nearly all Western coal falls into this category.

Coal previously generated 81% of Utah's electricity in 2013, and has been undergoing a gradual replacement with natural gas and renewables. higher carbon density than Wyoming coal, so less of it has to be burned to produce the same amount of electricity, thus producing less per capita carbon dioxide emissions.

It is also known as the innominate bone or os coxa. The coxal bone articulates with its fellow anteriorly at the pubic symphysis, with the sacrum posteriorly at the sacroiliac joint, and with the femur laterally at the hip joint. During pregnancy and at delivery, this joint allows for the expansion of the pelvic girdle and delivery of the baby through the birth canal.This is a relatively fixed joint, especially when compared to the joining of the 2 pelvic bones along the front of the body at the pubic symphysis.The 2 hip bones are joined to the sacrum along the back of the body at the sacroiliac joint.The head of the humerus fits into the depression of the scapula called the glenoid cavity (glenoid fossa). The capitulum, a small knob on the end of the humerus, and the trochlea, a pulley-shaped part of the humerus, fit together with the head of the radius and the trochlear notch of the ulna, respectively. ### Pelvic Girdle\n\nThe pelvis is a composite structure composed of the sacrum (along the dorsal, or back-side aspect) and 2 hip bones, the coxal, or innominate, bones.

During pregnancy and at delivery, this joint allows for the expansion of the pelvic girdle and delivery of the baby through the birth canal.The broad blades on the back of the pelvis are the ilium portions of the hip bones.The ventral portion of the hip bone is divided into a superior (pubis) and inferior (ischium), around which is a large opening called the obturator foramen.At approximately the location where all 3 portions of the hip bone connect is a large depression where the ball of the femur (leg bone) connects. The pelvic girdle consists of the two hip bones, also called the coxal bones or ossa coxae. The pelvic girdle provides strong, stable support for the vertebral column, protects the organs of the pelvis, and provides a site for the lower limbs to attach to the axial skeleton.The hip bones are the broadest in the body.The hip bones are originally three separate bones in infants: the ilium, ischium, and pubis.These bones fuse together by age 23.The hip bones are united to each other in the front at the pubic symphysis joint and in the back by the sacrum and coccyx.How does wearing high-heeled shoes upset the distribution of the weight of the body on the feet? The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. At the level of the upper border of the pubic symphysis, the tip of coccyx is located. It’s created by the upper surface of the body of the very first coccygeal vertebra and articulates with the apex of sacrum to create a cartilaginous sacrococcygeal joint. The pelvic girdle consists of two coxal bones, or hip bones, that support the attachment of the lower limbs. The coxal bones articulate with the sacrum posteriorly and with each other anteriorly to form an almost rigid, bony pelvis (plural, pelves). Every one of the joint’s surfaces is enveloped by hyaline cartilage and is connected throughout the midline to surrounding surfaces by fibrocartilage. Functionally, the pubic symphysis is referred to as a secondary cartilaginous (fibrocartilage) joint and biomechanically, while starting as a synchondrosis, pubic symphysis becomes a nonsynovial amphi-arthrodial joint. The pubic symphysis joint includes two pubic bones (each including a pubic body and superior and inferior rami) and a stepping in fibrocartilaginous disc. • Sacrum Creates posterior part of the bony pelvis. • Conducts the weight of the body to the pelvic girdle via the sacroiliac joints.

It was Parker's fifth Top 20 hit, the sixth being 1984's \"Ghostbusters\". A turning point in the tone occurs when Parker borrows a line from The Police's \"Every Breath You Take\", \"Every breath you take, I'll be watching you.\" The song's lyrics are in the same vein as Gary Puckett & The Union Gap's \"Young Girl\" and The Knack's \"My Sharona\" as pointed out by HitFix's Melinda Newman. She added, the lyrics are \"sweet\" and tortuous as he sings \"Oh, I still dream of a simple life/ Boy meets girl/ makes her his wife/ But love don't exist when you live like this... All these roads steer me wrong/ But I still drive them all night long/ all night long\". \"I'll Still Love You More\" is a song recorded by American country music artist Trisha Yearwood for her seventh studio album Where Your Road Leads (1998). It was written by Diane Warren, produced by Yearwood and Tony Brown, and released in April 1999 as the album's fourth single.\n\n"

Antigone was the daughter and the second child of Berenice, a noblewoman from Eordeaea, and her first husband Philip. Based on Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4), her father was previously married and had children, including daughters. According to Apollodorus of Athens, Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547–546 BC), and died shortly afterwards. Establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. Themistius, a 4th-century Byzantine rhetorician, mentions that he was the \"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\" Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose, at least in the Western world. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. ; Antigone, daughter of Eurytion and first wife of Peleus. In Greek mythology, Antigona or Antigone (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιγόνη meaning 'worthy of one's parents' or 'in place of one's parents') was the name of the following figures: \n\nSeptember 22 (traditional date) &ndash; Euripides, Greek playwright (d. 406 BC) ; Antiphon, Attic orator (d. 411 BC) ; Philolaus, Greek mathematician and philosopher (d. c. 405 BC) ; Ezra, Jewish scribe and priest (d. c. 440 BCE) \n\n powerful regent Antipater and was related to members of the Argead dynasty.

        "context": " Antigone (Ἀντιγόνη, born before 317 BC -295 BC ) was a Greek Macedonian noblewoman. Antigone was the daughter and the second child of Berenice, a noblewoman from Eordeaea, and her first husband Philip. Based on Plutarch (Pyrrhus 4.4), her father was previously married and had children, including daughters. According to Apollodorus of Athens, Greek grammarian of the 2nd century BC, he was sixty-four years old during the second year of the 58th Olympiad (547–546 BC), and died shortly afterwards. Establishing a timeline of his work is now impossible, since no document provides chronological references. Themistius, a 4th-century Byzantine rhetorician, mentions that he was the \"first of the known Greeks to publish a written document on nature.\" Therefore, his texts would be amongst the earliest written in prose, at least in the Western world. However, we know from Aristotle that Thales, also from Miletus, precedes Anaximander. ; Antigone, daughter of Eurytion and first wife of Peleus. In Greek mythology, Antigona or Antigone (Ancient Greek: Ἀντιγόνη meaning 'worthy of one's parents' or 'in place of one's parents') was the name of the following figures: \n\nSeptember 22 (traditional date) &ndash; Euripides, Greek playwright (d. 406 BC) ; Antiphon, Attic orator (d. 411 BC) ; Philolaus, Greek mathematician and philosopher (d. c. 405 BC) ; Ezra, Jewish scribe and priest (d. c. 440 BCE) \n\n powerful regent Antipater and was related to members of the Argead dynasty. About 318 BC, Antigone's father died of natural causes.\n\n"

It is one of the two types of tissue in the brain, the other being white matter. Gray matter plays a crucial role in various brain functions, including sensory perception, memory, speech, and decision-making. Unlike white matter, which mainly consists of nerve fibers coated in a myelin sheath, gray matter contains the cell bodies, dendrites, and unmyelinated axons of neurons. Gray matter is particularly important for higher cognitive functions as it is involved in complex neural processes. It is densely packed in the outer layers of the brain called the cortex, where it forms the gray matter lining. Understanding the organization and function of gray matter is essential for studying various neurological conditions and diseases. In summary, gray matter is a vital component of the nervous system, composed of neuron cell bodies that process information in the brain. A neuron is divided into three parts cell body, axon and dendrites. Cell body is the main cellular part of the neuron. Sometimes the neuron has insulation sheet called myelin associated with it. Those neurons are called myelinated nerve cell. These type of neuron found in theperipheral nervous system. Dendrites are the short but numerous extension arising from the cell body.

Brain cells make up the functional tissue of the brain. The two main types of cells in the brain are neurons, also known as nerve cells, and glial cells also known as neuroglia. Neurons are often grouped into a cluster known as a nucleus where they usually have roughly similar connections and functions. Nuclei are connected to other nuclei by tracts of white matter. Neurons are cells that are specialized to receive, propagate, and transmit electrochemical impulses. Some neurons such as photoreceptor cells, for example, do not have myelinated axons that conduct action potentials. The main components of neurons in the human body include the cell body, dendrites, and axons. The cell body contains the nucleus and fibers or processes extending from it. Dendrites conduct impulses towards the cell body, while axons conduct impulses away from the cell body. Neurons can be categorized into three types: motor (efferent) neurons, sensory (afferent) neurons, and connecting (internuncial) neurons. Motor neurons transmit impulses from the central nervous system (CNS) to muscles and glands, while sensory neurons transmit impulses towards the CNS. Gray matter contains clusters of neuron cell bodies and fibers not covered with myelin. White matter, on the other hand, is composed of bundles of myelinated nerve fibers that conduct impulses along the fibers.

There are three main functions of the brainstem:\n\n1) The brainstem plays a role in conduction. Due to their properties of being “programmable,” stem cells are capable of replacing job-specific body cells that may have been damaged beyond repair. Stem cells are very structurally similar to the typical somatic cells that you would find in the human body. They differ because their DNA components are present, but inactive. Because of their never before seen functional flexibility, stem cells have become very prominent in mainstream media and are fascinated by many, including myself. From our development in the womb to a possible middle-age knee surgery, stem cells have distinct uses and functions in our body, and scientists are discovering more of them every day. DNA also plays a MAJOR role in the function of stem cells. These genes are what give the body its instructions to function. In stem cells, once specific genes have become tagged with a methyl group, they tell the cell to begin its physical change into whatever type of cell the genes were tagged for. During development in the womb, stem cells are synthesized and from then on divide until they either differentiate or die off. When the body responds to specific changes in the environment, methyl groups are tagged onto specific genes inside the cell’s nucleus. The location and frequency of these methyl tags are what determines what the stem cell’s function will be. As chemical imbalances occur, this lace of proteoglycans, heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, hyaluronic acid, and proteins like collagen and elastin cause the cells within it to receive signals to apply methyl group tags. While some factors for chemical differentiation have not yet been researched in depth, it is apparent that the major influence on stem cell differentiation is the environment. The chemical processes the environment of a cell causes it to go through not only are vital for the healthy behavior and adaptation of cells, it is majorly responsible for deciding what, how, and where stem cells are prompted to change in our bodies.

        "context": " stem. There are three main functions of the brainstem:\n\n1) The brainstem plays a role in conduction. Due to their properties of being “programmable,” stem cells are capable of replacing job-specific body cells that may have been damaged beyond repair. Stem cells are very structurally similar to the typical somatic cells that you would find in the human body. They differ because their DNA components are present, but inactive. Because of their never before seen functional flexibility, stem cells have become very prominent in mainstream media and are fascinated by many, including myself. From our development in the womb to a possible middle-age knee surgery, stem cells have distinct uses and functions in our body, and scientists are discovering more of them every day. DNA also plays a MAJOR role in the function of stem cells. These genes are what give the body its instructions to function. In stem cells, once specific genes have become tagged with a methyl group, they tell the cell to begin its physical change into whatever type of cell the genes were tagged for. During development in the womb, stem cells are synthesized and from then on divide until they either differentiate or die off. When the body responds to specific changes in the environment, methyl groups are tagged onto specific genes inside the cell’s nucleus.

The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. A pulmonary shunt refers to the passage of deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the left without participation in gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries. It is a pathological condition that results when the alveoli of the lungs are perfused with blood as normal, but ventilation (the supply of air) fails to supply the perfused region. In other words, the ventilation/perfusion ratio (the ratio of air reaching the alveoli to blood perfusing them) is zero. The shunt fraction is the percentage of blood put out by the heart that is not completely oxygenated. A normal lung is imperfectly ventilated and perfused, and a small degree of intrapulmonary shunting is normal. Anatomical shunting occurs when blood supply to the lungs via the pulmonary arteries is returned via the pulmonary veins without passing through the pulmonary capillaries, thereby bypassing alveolar gas exchange. Capillary shunting is blood that passes through capillaries of unventilated alveoli or deoxygenated blood flowing directly from pulmonary arterioles to nearby pulmonary veins through anastomoses, bypassing the alveolar capillaries. This drainage of deoxygenated blood straight into the systemic circulation is why the arterial PO2 is normally slightly lower than the alveolar PO2, known as the alveolar–arterial gradient, a useful clinical sign in determining the cause of hypoxia. Pulmonary shunting is minimized by the normal reflex constriction of pulmonary vasculature to hypoxia. For example, when alveoli fill with fluid, they are unable to participate in gas exchange with blood, causing local or regional hypoxia, thus triggering vasoconstriction. For instance, if there is a certain alveolus that is not being ventilated, blood will still flow through the capillary which irrigates it instead of going elsewhere, as the problem does not reside in the perfusion. A decrease in perfusion relative to ventilation (as occurs in pulmonary embolism, for example) is an example of increased dead space. Pulmonary shunting causes the blood supply leaving a shunted area of the lung to have lower levels of oxygen and higher levels of carbon dioxide (i.e., the normal gas exchange does not occur). A pulmonary shunt occurs as a result of blood flowing right-to-left through cardiac openings or in pulmonary arteriovenous malformations.

Merchants and mining companies—such as Anglesey's Parys Mining Co.—began to issue their own copper tokens to fill the need for small change. Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. Typically, 1 lb. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Each pound of bronze was coined into 48 pennies. The minting of silver pennies for general circulation was halted by the British government in 1660, because the cost of silver had risen too high. By the late 18th century this policy had caused a deficiency in the number of circulating pennies, and many merchants and mining companies had taken to issuing their own copper tokens. For example, the Parys Mining Company on Anglesey issued huge numbers of tokens (although their acceptability was limited). In 1797 to alleviate this coin shortage, the government authorised Matthew Boulton to strike copper pennies and twopences at his Soho Mint in Birmingham. Zinc is known to kill the viruses that cause colds, but the healing that it brings directly to irritated tissues is more likely due to antioxidant actions. **_Zinc, Cancer, and Other Problems_**\n\nIn relation to cancer, zinc has many interesting functions. Lower zinc levels have been found in patients with esophageal, bronchial, and prostate cancers. Adding zinc to the diets of various rodents has stopped chemically induced cancer from starting. Also, the copper/zinc form of SOD and other antioxidant enzymes are lower in the cells that cancer corrupts. All of this points to zinc as a preventative to cancer. But it has also been found that cancer growth is slower when we take zinc away! The reason for this is probably that zinc, being essential for DNA synthesis, is necessary for _all_ cell growth, even malignant growth. Taking away the zinc from established cancer cells keeps them from reproducing their malignancy. Industrial techniques and steam-power was introduced to coin manufacture by Matthew Boulton in Birmingham in 1788. By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded to this crisis by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. The industrialist Mathew Boulton turned his attention to coinage in the mid-1780s as an extension to the small metal products he already manufactured in his factory in Soho. In 1788 he established a Mint as part of his industrial plant. He invented a steam driven screw press in the same year (his original machinery was being used at the Royal Mint until 1881, \n\nThe most common form of toxicosis from coins results when dogs ingest change left within their reach. Often, a puppy or dog who likes to eat any sort of object within reach will become ill after ingesting coins. Not only does the eating of coins allow for the risk of an obstruction in the esophagus or intestine, the compounds in coins will break down when they come in contact with gastric make up of the stomach. The release of zinc, which results due to the low PH of the stomach, is then transported to the liver, bones, pancreas, and more in the form of caustic zinc salts. Zinc salts can be corrosive on tissues such as the muscles and the prostate, irritating them in the process. Additionally, the proper use of iron and copper for example can be disrupted by zinc. If you suspect your pet has eaten coins a veterinary visit is necessary. Toxicity will depend on the size of the dog and the type of coin eaten; most cases of coin poisoning in canines involve pennies, in particular the penny minted after 1982. A pet who has ingested coins must be seen by a veterinarian immediately. Symptoms of coin poisoning are not obvious right away; studies have not determined the length of time that it takes for the zinc in pennies to begin to make your pet sick. The coins will need to be removed from your dog’s stomach or wherever they may be in the gastrointestinal system. Pennies in particular can adhere to the lining of the stomach and do not always dislodge easily. Because the coins may eventually cause an obstruction, it is not safe to assume they will pass through your pet’s system on their own. Medications can be administered through the intravenous line, including gastroprotectants, antinausea drugs, and medications designed to prevent further zinc absorption. Removal of the coins may be done surgically (laparotomy) or by endoscopy (tube with camera). The method of removal will depend on the location of the coins and how difficult it appears they may be to remove. Contingent upon the severity of the coin poisoning, your canine companion may have an extensive hospital stay. Some cases whereby the coins were removed quickly and symptoms were minimal, recovery may be fairly quick but dogs who ingested a large amount of coins and were highly symptomatic may be under veterinarian care for days to weeks. Possible complications resulting from coin poisoning are residual kidney and liver issues, anemia, and pancreatitis. The main concern is that the dimes could become a foreign body. They can x-ray him to determine if and where the dime is. Also, if you think any other coins may have been eaten, the zinc in some coins can be a chronic problem, and you should see your veterinarian if that is a possibility. It there is a chance that the coins contained zinc (primarily pennies), she should be seen by your veterinarian and have an x-ray to see if she actually did eat the coins.

Merchants and mining companies—such as Anglesey's Parys Mining Co.—began to issue their own copper tokens to fill the need for small change. Finally, amid the Napoleonic Wars, the government authorized Matthew Boulton to mint copper pennies and twopences at Soho Mint in Birmingham in 1797. Typically, 1 lb. of copper produced 24 pennies. In 1860, the copper penny was replaced with a bronze one (95% copper, 4% tin, 1% zinc). Each pound of bronze was coined into 48 pennies. The minting of silver pennies for general circulation was halted by the British government in 1660, because the cost of silver had risen too high. By the late 18th century this policy had caused a deficiency in the number of circulating pennies, and many merchants and mining companies had taken to issuing their own copper tokens. For example, the Parys Mining Company on Anglesey issued huge numbers of tokens (although their acceptability was limited). In 1797 to alleviate this coin shortage, the government authorised Matthew Boulton to strike copper pennies and twopences at his Soho Mint in Birmingham. Zinc is known to kill the viruses that cause colds, but the healing that it brings directly to irritated tissues is more likely due to antioxidant actions. **_Zinc, Cancer, and Other Problems_**\n\nIn relation to cancer, zinc has many interesting functions. Lower zinc levels have been found in patients with esophageal, bronchial, and prostate cancers. Adding zinc to the diets of various rodents has stopped chemically induced cancer from starting. Also, the copper/zinc form of SOD and other antioxidant enzymes are lower in the cells that cancer corrupts. All of this points to zinc as a preventative to cancer. But it has also been found that cancer growth is slower when we take zinc away! The reason for this is probably that zinc, being essential for DNA synthesis, is necessary for _all_ cell growth, even malignant growth. Taking away the zinc from established cancer cells keeps them from reproducing their malignancy. Industrial techniques and steam-power was introduced to coin manufacture by Matthew Boulton in Birmingham in 1788. By 1786, two-thirds of the coins in circulation in Britain were counterfeit, and the Royal Mint responded to this crisis by shutting itself down, worsening the situation. The industrialist Mathew Boulton turned his attention to coinage in the mid-1780s as an extension to the small metal products he already manufactured in his factory in Soho. In 1788 he established a Mint as part of his industrial plant. He invented a steam driven screw press in the same year (his original machinery was being used at the Royal Mint until 1881, \n\nThe most common form of toxicosis from coins results when dogs ingest change left within their reach. Often, a puppy or dog who likes to eat any sort of object within reach will become ill after ingesting coins. Not only does the eating of coins allow for the risk of an obstruction in the esophagus or intestine, the compounds in coins will break down when they come in contact with gastric make up of the stomach. The release of zinc, which results due to the low PH of the stomach, is then transported to the liver, bones, pancreas, and more in the form of caustic zinc salts. Zinc salts can be corrosive on tissues such as the muscles and the prostate, irritating them in the process. Additionally, the proper use of iron and copper for example can be disrupted by zinc. If you suspect your pet has eaten coins a veterinary visit is necessary. Toxicity will depend on the size of the dog and the type of coin eaten; most cases of coin poisoning in canines involve pennies, in particular the penny minted after 1982. A pet who has ingested coins must be seen by a veterinarian immediately. Symptoms of coin poisoning are not obvious right away; studies have not determined the length of time that it takes for the zinc in pennies to begin to make your pet sick. The coins will need to be removed from your dog’s stomach or wherever they may be in the gastrointestinal system. Pennies in particular can adhere to the lining of the stomach and do not always dislodge easily. Because the coins may eventually cause an obstruction, it is not safe to assume they will pass through your pet’s system on their own. Medications can be administered through the intravenous line, including gastroprotectants, antinausea drugs, and medications designed to prevent further zinc absorption. Removal of the coins may be done surgically (laparotomy) or by endoscopy (tube with camera). The method of removal will depend on the location of the coins and how difficult it appears they may be to remove. Contingent upon the severity of the coin poisoning, your canine companion may have an extensive hospital stay. Some cases whereby the coins were removed quickly and symptoms were minimal, recovery may be fairly quick but dogs who ingested a large amount of coins and were highly symptomatic may be under veterinarian care for days to weeks. Possible complications resulting from coin poisoning are residual kidney and liver issues, anemia, and pancreatitis. The main concern is that the dimes could become a foreign body. They can x-ray him to determine if and where the dime is. Also, if you think any other coins may have been eaten, the zinc in some coins can be a chronic problem, and you should see your veterinarian if that is a possibility. It there is a chance that the coins contained zinc (primarily pennies), she should be seen by your veterinarian and have an x-ray to see if she actually did eat the coins. I think my dog swallowed a quarter but I’m not positive.\n\n"

Health problems associated with dental fluorosis may occur when fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5 mg/l, which is the WHO guideline value since 1984. Excessive fluoride consumption can have several potential health effects. One of the most noticeable effects is fluorosis, which is characterized by the appearance of chalky white, irregular patches on the surface of tooth enamel. This occurs when fluoride accumulates in the teeth, particularly permanent teeth. In areas where the drinking water has a naturally high fluoride level or when fluoride is consumed in large amounts, fluorosis can occur. It's important to note that fluoride is necessary for the formation and health of bones and teeth. Fluoride deficiency can lead to tooth decay and possibly osteoporosis. To summarize, while the appropriate intake of fluoride is beneficial for dental and skeletal health, excessive fluoride consumption can lead to fluorosis and various health complications.

The addition of fluoride (fluoridation) to drinking water that is low in fluoride or the use of fluoride supplements significantly reduces the risk of tooth decay. Fluoride accumulates in teeth, particularly permanent teeth. These defects appear to affect appearance only and may even make the enamel more resistant to cavities. Fluoride also accumulates in bones. Rarely, consuming too much fluoride for a long time results in dense but weak bones, abnormal bone growths (spurs) on the spine, and crippling due to calcium accumulation (calcification) in ligaments.Treatment involves reducing fluoride consumption.For example, if people live in areas with high fluoride levels in the water, they should not drink fluoridated water or take fluoride supplements.Children should always be instructed not to swallow fluoridated toothpaste.Iodine\n\nThe thyroid gland contains most of the iodine in the body. Health problems associated with dental fluorosis may occur when fluoride concentrations in groundwater exceed 1.5 mg/l, which is the WHO guideline value since 1984. Excessive fluoride consumption can have several potential health effects. One of the most noticeable effects is fluorosis, which is characterized by the appearance of chalky white, irregular patches on the surface of tooth enamel. This occurs when fluoride accumulates in the teeth, particularly permanent teeth. In areas where the drinking water has a naturally high fluoride level or when fluoride is consumed in large amounts, fluorosis can occur. It's important to note that fluoride is necessary for the formation and health of bones and teeth. Fluoride deficiency can lead to tooth decay and possibly osteoporosis. To summarize, while the appropriate intake of fluoride is beneficial for dental and skeletal health, excessive fluoride consumption can lead to fluorosis and various health complications. It is essential to maintain a balanced fluoride intake to avoid both deficiency and excess. If you have concerns about your fluoride consumption, it is recommended to consult with a healthcare professional or dentist for personalized advice.\n\n"

Until this time, the North was generally confident about its prospects for quickly crushing the rebellion with an easy, direct strike against the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. The embarrassing rout of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's army during the battle made clear the fallacy of this viewpoint. If Confederates had hoped before this that they could sap Northern willpower and quietly slip away from the Union with \n\n In one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the Confederate forces led by Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard near Washington was repulsed at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas). The Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. After arriving in Washington, the regiment became part of Major General Irwin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia and saw their first combat during the Battle of Blackburn's Ford. After they crossed Bull Run at Blackburn's Ford, three companies of the 1st Massachusetts were ordered forward as skirmishers to probe the Confederate position.

Until this time, the North was generally confident about its prospects for quickly crushing the rebellion with an easy, direct strike against the Confederate capital at Richmond, Virginia. The embarrassing rout of Brig. Gen. Irvin McDowell's army during the battle made clear the fallacy of this viewpoint. If Confederates had hoped before this that they could sap Northern willpower and quietly slip away from the Union with \n\n In one of the first highly visible battles, in July 1861, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell on the Confederate forces led by Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard near Washington was repulsed at the First Battle of Bull Run (also known as First Manassas). The Union had the upper hand at first, nearly pushing confederate forces holding a defensive position into a rout, but Confederate reinforcements under Joseph E. Johnston arrived from the Shenandoah Valley by railroad, and the course of the battle quickly changed. After arriving in Washington, the regiment became part of Major General Irwin McDowell's Army of Northeastern Virginia and saw their first combat during the Battle of Blackburn's Ford. After they crossed Bull Run at Blackburn's Ford, three companies of the 1st Massachusetts were ordered forward as skirmishers to probe the Confederate position.

Oxygen-rich blood from the lungs returns to the left ventricle, but can't leave through the aorta as it does in a normal heart. The only way oxygen-rich blood can leave the left ventricle is to pass through the VSD into the right ventricle. There, it mixes with the oxygen-poor blood returning from the body.

How Is Double Outlet Right Ventricle (DORV) Diagnosed? Then, when the heart contracts, the oxygen-rich blood in the left ventricle flows through the VSD into the aorta. The VSD is closed to keep oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood from mixing in the ventricles. At age 2 weeks or younger: A Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunt redirects some of the left ventricle's output from the body to the lungs. – OR – If the blood flow to the lungs is too high, as can happen with a large VSD, a band around the pulmonary artery lessens the flow to prevent damage. At age 4‒6 months: The Glenn procedure allows blood returning from the upper part of the body to flow directly to the lungs. At age 1.5‒3 years: The Fontan procedure channels blood from the lower half of the body to the lungs so the heart pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body only. Blood returning from the body flows to the lungs before passing through the heart. Extra pressure on blood going to the lungs of babies with DORV can damage the lungs' blood vessels and lead to heart failure. Venous return (VR) is the flow of blood back to the heart.

The de-oxygenated blood from the right ventricle is pumped to the lungs where the capillaries surrounding the alveole sacks exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The red blood cells and the hemoglobin present in the blood, which is the main carrier of oxygen in the blood are responsible for this exchange of gases before they are carried to the left ventricle of the heart. Arteries carry the oxygenated blood while the veins carry the deoxygenated blood. This deoxygenated blood then passes through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen through the process of diffusion, oxygenating the blood. On the other hand, oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It then passes through the bicuspid valve (also known as the mitral valve) and enters the left ventricle. Finally, it is pumped out of the heart through the aortic valve and into the aorta for distribution to the rest of the body in the systemic circulation. Throughout this process, the heart ensures that blood flows in one direction through the use of valves.

The Allegheny River runs from its headwaters just below the middle of Pennsylvania's northern border northwesterly into New York then in a zigzag southwesterly across the border and through Western Pennsylvania to join the Monongahela River at the Forks of the Ohio on the \"Point\" of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Allegheny River is, by volume, the main headstream of both the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. Historically, the Allegheny was considered to be the upper Ohio \n\n The Tennessee River, the largest tributary of the Ohio River, is a 652 mi long river in the southeastern United States. The river drains the Tennessee Valley watershed, and is located within four states: Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky. In East Tennessee, the river runs through Chattanooga, whose city limits touch the Tennessee–Georgia border in some places, and runs into Alabama south of Nickajack Dam less than one mile from the tripoint where Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama meet.\n\n"

The Deccan Queen is a daily Indian passenger train service operated by the Central Railway zone of the Indian Railways connecting the cities of Mumbai and Pune. It has an average operating speed of 120 km/h including stops, and a top speed of 105 km/h, making it among the fastest trains in India. The train's long history and common use as a commuter train has gained it significant popularity, including annual celebrations of its \"birthday\" on June 1 at Pune Junction. It is hauled by a Kalyan-based WCAM-3 end to end. Routes are electrified with 25 kV AC electric traction while 33% of them are double or multi-tracked. As the average speed of the train is above 55 km/hr, as per Indian Railways rules, its fare includes a Superfast surcharge. It is the fastest Rajdhani service in all of India, with a maximum permissible speed of 130 km/h, although its all coaches are of air conditioned LHB type which is capable of reaching 160 km/h.\n\n"

The U.S. minimum wage was last raised to $7.25 per hour in July 2009. Ten states index their minimum wage to inflation.

Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies. Pigs \n\n the infected turkeys had suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. Virus experts were concerned that a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if H1N1/09 combines again with avian flu, which is far more virulent but much less contagious to humans. In October 2009, a ferret exhibiting flu symptoms was confirmed to have contracted the H1N1 virus from its owner in Oregon. In November 2009, a case of novel H1N1 was confirmed in a household cat. Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. The infective stage of the patient with influenza A (H1N1) is the period from 1 day prior to the onset of symptoms to day 7 after the onset or to 24 h after the absence of symptoms (the longer one should be defined as the infective stage).Although the influenza A (H1N1) virus has been found in the body of pigs, no evidence has been found to prove that the animal is the source of infection.One week later, the boy was cured. The WHO and the CDC indicated that the influenza cases in Mexico and the USA were infected by the same strain of H1N1 subtype of swine influenza virus. After large-scale prevalence of a new influenza virus in human being, persons with a history of infection or vaccination can acquire certain resistance to such virus.

Another study, of 804 rural Iowans, found that pig farmers were 50 times more likely, and their spouses about 30 times more likely, than university workers to carry swine flu antibodies. Pigs \n\n the infected turkeys had suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. Virus experts were concerned that a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if H1N1/09 combines again with avian flu, which is far more virulent but much less contagious to humans. In October 2009, a ferret exhibiting flu symptoms was confirmed to have contracted the H1N1 virus from its owner in Oregon. In November 2009, a case of novel H1N1 was confirmed in a household cat. Top flu and animal-health experts with the WHO and the CDC were monitoring the situation closely. The first case of a dog with H1N1 was reported in December 2009. The infective stage of the patient with influenza A (H1N1) is the period from 1 day prior to the onset of symptoms to day 7 after the onset or to 24 h after the absence of symptoms (the longer one should be defined as the infective stage).Although the influenza A (H1N1) virus has been found in the body of pigs, no evidence has been found to prove that the animal is the source of infection.One week later, the boy was cured. The WHO and the CDC indicated that the influenza cases in Mexico and the USA were infected by the same strain of H1N1 subtype of swine influenza virus. After large-scale prevalence of a new influenza virus in human being, persons with a history of infection or vaccination can acquire certain resistance to such virus.

Many species of mammals have diastemata as a normal feature, most commonly between the incisors and molars. Diastemata are common for children and can exist in adult teeth as well. Diastemata are primarily caused by imbalance in the relationship between the jaw and the size of the teeth. This size discrepancy can result in gaps between the teeth. When this tissue extends down and between the two front teeth, it can create a gap. This regular pressure can lead to the development of gaps over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form at the missing teeth site, and the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. To address gaps between teeth, there are cosmetic dentistry treatments available. Porcelain veneers, for example, are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, effectively closing gaps. Dental bonding is another treatment option that can address the appearance of undersized teeth by widening them to close gaps. The plural is diastemata.Also it is the gap between primary and secondary wing feathers in some species of birds including raptors.cheek teeth diastema – one of the most painful oral conditions in the horse.In horses, the term refers to a gap between teeth of the same type, e.g.## Diastema\n\nA gap between the front and cheek teeth in ruminants.For example, a horse which is undergoing stress and happens to be a salmonella carrier may develop diarrhoea, and this may be exacerbated by tetracycline therapy which removes normal bacterial antagonists of the salmonella. ## Diastasis\n\nDiastasis is a term applied to separation of the end of a growing bone from the shaft. ## Diastema\n\nA gap between the front and cheek teeth in ruminants. In horses, the term refers to a gap between teeth of the same type, e.g. Also it is the gap between primary and secondary wing feathers in some species of birds including raptors. It refers to an increased gap between the scaphoid and lunate bones, which gives the appearance of a widened space between these two bones. Gaps can occur between any teeth, but for those with large gaps between the front facing teeth, dental gaps can be a source of self-consciousness. What Causes Gaps between Teeth? Size mismatch: When the size of the teeth are small in comparison to the size of the jaw bone, gaps may occur between the teeth. This regular pressure can push the upper teeth forward, causing gaps to develop over time. When teeth are lost, gaps will form where there are missing teeth but the remaining teeth may also shift, leading to gaps between adjacent teeth. Porcelain Veneers: Porcelain veneers are tooth-shaped fabrications that can be used to adjust the size and shape of the teeth, closing gaps between teeth in as little as two dental appointments. Dental Bonding: Similar to porcelain veneers, dental bonding treatment can address the appearance of undersized teeth, widening the teeth to close gaps. Dental Crowns: Dental crowns may also be used to widen undersized teeth, effectively closing gaps between the teeth.
