You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

  The simplest and easiest way to detect trisomy 8 is by a Karyotype, a photograph representing all chromosomes of a cell in an orderly manner. Amniocentesis is also a technique for diagnosis. Samples from the Amniotic Liquid is taken from a fetus, cultured, then analyzed by a karyotype. If the photograph shows 3 copies of chromosome 8 instead of 2, then the individual has trisomy 8.

  "blue." These difficulties persist up until around age four, even after hundreds of explicit training trials. The inability for children to understand color stems from the cognitive process of whole object constraint. Whole object constraint is the idea that a child will understand that a novel word represents the entirety of that object. Then, if the child is presented with further novel words, they attach inferred meanings to the object. However, color is the last attribute to be considered because it explains the least about the object itself. Children's behavior clearly indicates that they have knowledge of these words, but this knowledge is far from complete; rather it appears to be predictive, as opposed to all-or-none.

  Baby books can be used to track a child's development or mark developmental milestones. Many have ledgers that can track disease and immunizations. Some books are pre-fabricated with fill-in-the blank areas and places to put special mementos, such as a lock of hair from the baby's first haircut, a hospital bracelet, birth announcements, or cards from the baby shower. Parents may include ultrasound pictures, pictures of the baby at birth, and pictures as the child grows up. Parents can look at baby books for memories. Baby books have also been used for research. UCLA has a collection of baby books dating back to 1882 used for the study of the history of childhood, family, art, medicine, architecture, and other disciplines. Various memories can be included in the baby books like birth story, baby shower, naming of the baby, first cry, walking or sitting, first movement, saying first word, as well as various occasions like first Christmas, Easter, Thanksgiving, Pictures for each month Christening/Baptism/Dedication.

 One good example is that the eyes and ears are assuming a more normal placement.His or her features are becoming more babyish.Your baby still only weighs about three ounces (85 grams) and is just over six inches (15 centimeters) long.However, there are more mistakes earlier, so take a guess now with a grain of salt.**Back or abdominal pain:** This type of pain or discomfort may be the result of contractions or premature dilation of the cervix, which is a sign of potential preterm labor. **More than six contractions per hour:** This can be a sign of preterm labor. It can be normal to have contractions, just not at this frequency. **Gush of fluid from the vagina:** To determine if this means your water has broken prematurely, make an appointment to see your practitioner. The fluid may be normal vaginal discharge. _Report any strange or troublesome symptoms to your practitioner immediately_. **BODY BASICS**

Hopefully you are enjoying some of the glow of pregnancy. Remember, not every expectant mom feels happy all the time. Even if you don't feel physically sick, it is normal to have a few days or weeks where you feel blah or cranky. Some women want to know what all the fuss is about in pregnancy. Everyone says you should enjoy it, but what if you don't all the time? Don't feel guilty if you don't feel 100 percent connected to your pregnancy at every moment. Some women need time to let the idea settle in their minds—even if they went to great lengths to get pregnant. Hang in there, feelings of uncertainty or ambivalence will surely pass. **BABY DATA**

You are not the only one going to the bathroom every hour. Your baby's bladder fills and empties about once an hour from this point on. This is good practice for your baby's kidneys. Zometimes, via ultrasound, if you catch your baby at the right time, you can even witness this. Around now, sometimes ultrasound can begin to hazard a guess as to whether your baby is a girl or a boy. However, there are more mistakes earlier, so take a guess now with a grain of salt. Your baby still only weighs about three ounces (85 grams) and is just over six inches (15 centimeters) long. His or her features are becoming more babyish. One good example is that the eyes and ears are assuming a more normal placement.### **PREGNANCY PARTICULARS**

#### **Feel Your Baby Move**

Most moms will tell you that feeling the baby move is one of the best things in pregnancy.However, it is also one of the things that will lead to a host of questions in your pregnancy.Here are some common questions and answers about fetal movement.WHEN SHOULD I FEEL MY BABY MOVE?The first movements of your baby happened weeks ago.

  Pointing is dependent on vision, and is not observed in children who are blind from birth. A number of differences have been observed regarding the onset of pointing behavior and gender, and the tendency to point using the right or left hand, with girls being more likely to point up to 15 degrees into the left visual periphery using their right hand, and being ambidextrous further to the left, while boys are typically ambidextrous for 15 degrees to the left and right of center.

  Humans are able to see an array of colours because light in the visible spectrum is made up of different wavelengths (from 380 to 760 nm). Our ability to see in colour is due to three different cone cells in the retina, containing three different photopigments. The three cones are each specialized to best pick up a certain wavelength (420, 530 and 560 nm or roughly the colours blue, green and red). The brain is able to distinguish the wavelength and colour in the field of vision by figuring out which cone has been stimulated. The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation. Primates are the only mammals with colour vision. The Trichromatic theory was proposed in 1802 by Thomas Young. According to Young, the human visual system is able to create any colour through the collection of information from the three cones. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected.

No one had seen me there. I gingerly shifted along the bench to look at the patient's face. The eyes were wide open, staring into the dome. She was ashen white but still beautiful. Fine cheekbones and jet-black hair. Like the nurses, I couldn't leave. I needed to know what happened next. They peeled back the bloodied drapes from her naked body. My brain was screaming for them to take out that hideous metal retractor cranking open her breastbone. Let her heart go back where it belongs. They did. The ribs recoiled and the poor lifeless organ was covered again. It lay flat, empty and defeated in its own space, now just a fearsome deep gash separated her tender, swollen breasts. The intercom was still switched on. The nurses started to talk. "What will happen to her baby?" "Adopted, I guess. She wasn't married. Her parents were killed in the Blitz." "Where did she live?" "Whitechapel. I think maybe the London don't do heart surgery yet. She got really sick during the pregnancy. Rheumatic fever. She nearly died during the delivery. Might have been for the best." "Where is the baby now?" "On the ward, I think. Matron will have to deal with it." This was so matter of fact. A young woman had died. Her baby left without a relative in the world. No more love. No more warmth. Gone amid that tangled blood-soaked technology in the operating theater. This was what I aspired to. Was I ready? Two student nurses came to wash the body. I recognized them from the Friday night freshers dance. They were respectful public schoolgirls. They brought a bucket of soapy water with sponges and set about scrubbing the body. They removed all of the tubing but were visibly upset by the wound and what lay beneath. Blood kept dripping out of it. "What did she have done?" said the girl I had danced with. "Heart operation, obviously," came the reply. "Valve replacement, I guess. Poor kid. She's only our age. Bet her mum's upset."The scrub nurse returned and called back the surgical resident to close over the wound before the move to the mortuary.All deaths on the operating table are referred to the coroner for autopsy.She would be sliced open again, so there was no point in closing the breastbone or bringing together the different layers of the chest wall.

   In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain. Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. She concluded that "An atmosphere of that gas would

  yet, about 2 of its mass. (The contribution for any object of laboratory size is negligible, about, so only measurements of planet-sized or bigger objects would allow this effect to be neasured.) If the Moon revolved around only the Earth, there would be no way to tell what fraction of the Moon's or the Earth's gravity was caused by each form of mass, since only the total can be measured. However, the orbit of the Moon is also strongly affected by the gravity of the Sun – in essence, Earth and Moon are in free fall around the Sun. If the energy

  The Weak Equivalence Principle says that all objects fall the same way in a gravity field, no matter what they are made of. The Earth and the Moon have very different compositions—for example, the Earth has a large iron core, but the Moon does not. Furthermore, both are in orbit around the Sun, meaning that they are both falling towards the Sun at all times, even as they revolve around each other. If the Earth and the Moon were affected differently by the gravity of the Sun, this would directly affect the orbit of the Moon around the Earth. As closely as

  Indian mathematician-astronomer Aryabhata, in his Aryabhatiya first identifies the force gravity to explain why objects do not fall when the Earth rotates, propounds a geocentric Solar System of gravitation, and an eccentric elliptical model of the planets, where the planets spin on their axis and follow elliptical orbits, the Sun and the Moon revolve around the Earth in epicycles. He also writes that the planets and the Moon do not have their own light but reflect the light of the Sun and that the Earth rotates on its axis causing day and night and also that the Sun rotates around the Earth causing years.

  Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, go back to your computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have something to say about the Moon's birth." At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant-impact hypothesis emerged as the most favored hypothesis. "Before the conference, there were partisans of the three 'traditional' theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn't think the debate would ever be resolved.

 The presence of Milankovitch cycles in stratified banded iron formation supports the hypothesis of orbital forcing of ice sheets during snowball Earth. This is because the Milankovitch cycles, which refer to regular variations in the Earth's orbit and axial tilt, have been found to be preserved in the stratified banded iron formation deposited during the Sturtian snowball Earth period.

These cycles, caused by variations in the Earth's orbital eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession, have been linked to cyclical glaciation and deglaciation events throughout Earth's history. The presence of these cycles in the banded iron formation indicates that orbital forcing played a role in the cyclical advance and retreat of global ice sheets during the snowball Earth period.

The cyclical advance and retreat of ice sheets would have led to fluctuating environmental conditions, including periods of glaciation and melting. These changing conditions would have influenced the deposition of sediment, including the formation of banded iron layers. The periodic oxidation of ferrous iron within these layers can be attributed to the orbital glacial cycles.

Overall, the presence of Milankovitch cycles in the stratified banded iron formation provides evidence for orbitally forced cyclicity of global ice sheets during snowball Earth. This supports the hypothesis that orbital forcing played a significant role in the dynamics of ice sheets and explains the sedimentological cyclicity observed in these formations.

 Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit have similar orientations. ; The Earth–Moon system contains an anomalously high angular momentum.  Meaning, the momentum contained in Earth's rotation, the Moon's rotation, and the Moon revolving around Earth is significantly higher than the other terrestrial planets. A giant impact might have supplied this excess momentum. ; Moon samples indicate that the Moon was once molten down to a substantial, but unknown, depth. This might have required more energy than predicted to be available from the accretion of a body of the Moon's size. An extremely energetic process, such as a giant impact, could provide this energy. ; The Moon has a relatively small iron core. This gives the Moon a

 Satellite laser ranging (SLR) and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) data are used to gather information on variations in the length of day and the position of the rotation pole with respect to the Earth's surface geography. These data provide valuable insights into the effects of mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers on the Earth's rotation and sea level.

SLR involves sending laser beams from ground stations to satellites equipped with retroreflectors. By measuring the round-trip time of these laser pulses, scientists can accurately determine the distance between the ground station and the satellite. Changes in the length of day can alter the distribution of mass on Earth, leading to variations in its rotation rate. SLR data can be used to track these changes and provide information on the redistribution of mass caused by melting ice sheets and glaciers. This helps in understanding the contribution of mass loss to the observed rise in sea levels.

VLBI is a technique that combines data from multiple radio telescopes to create an interferometer with extremely high angular resolution. It is used to measure the precise positions and motions of radio-emitting celestial objects, including quasars. By observing these quasars over long periods, VLBI can detect small variations in the Earth's rotation and determine the position of the rotation pole.

By analyzing SLR and VLBI data, scientists can study how changes in mass distribution affect the Earth's rotation and its position in space. This information, in turn, helps in understanding the impact of ongoing mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers on the length of day and the position of the rotation pole. By studying these variations, scientists can evaluate the plausibility of the hypothesis that mass loss is contributing to the observed rise in sea levels.

In summary, satellite laser ranging and very long baseline interferometry data play a crucial role in providing valuable constraints and insights into the variations in the length of day and the position of the rotation pole with respect to the Earth's surface geography. These data help in evaluating the hypothesis of ongoing mass loss from ice sheets and glaciers and its potential contribution to the rise in global sea levels.

He also writes that the planets and the Moon do not have their own light but reflect the light of the Sun and that the Earth rotates on its axis causing day and night and also that the Sun rotates around the Earth causing years.
 2 -0.32610  The Weak Equivalence Principle says that all objects fall the same way in a gravity field, no matter what they are made of. The Earth and the Moon have very different compositions—for example, the Earth has a large iron core, but the Moon does not. Furthermore, both are in orbit around the Sun, meaning that they are both falling towards the Sun at all times, even as they revolve around each other.

  The sense of smell is called olfaction. All materials constantly shed molecules, which float into the nose or are sucked in through breathing. Inside the nasal chambers is the neuroepithelium, a lining deep within the nostrils that contains the receptors responsible for detecting molecules that are small enough to smell. These receptor neurons then synapse at the olfactory cranial nerve (CN I), which sends the information to the olfactory bulbs in the brain for initial processing. The signal is then sent to the remaining olfactory cortex for more complex processing.

OPTIC NERVE

The optic nerve is the second cranial nerve. It is entirely sensory, and conducts the nerve impulses for vision. ** _The Felt Sense of the Biological Conflict_**

Symptoms of the optic nerve can arise in someone who wants to cut off or halt visual information before it arrives, a person who doesn't want to be seen or doesn't want to see someone else looking. CORNEA

The cornea is a curved, transparent coat that covers the colored iris. ** _The Felt Sense of the Biological Conflict_**

Disorders of the cornea reflect conflicts about what we see or wish to see. Specific conditions will arise from various nuances of feeling, as follows:

  *  **Keratitis:** Ulceration, inflammation, even herpes of the cornea can develop during conflicts of visual separation or conflicts of imposed visual contact. One thinks, _"I'm losing eye contact with_ _my beautiful fiancée,"_ or, conversely, _"I'm obliged all day long to see_ _my sergeant. "_

Inside the nasal chambers is the neuroepithelium, a lining deep within the nostrils that contains the receptors responsible for detecting molecules that are small enough to smell. These receptor neurons then synapse at the olfactory cranial nerve (CN I), which sends the information to the olfactory bulbs in the brain for initial processing. The signal is then sent to the remaining olfactory cortex for more complex processing.

 But it can also happen that a patient comes in for diagnostic tests and evaluation, finds out there is a serious illness, and feels compelled to stay in the hospital and have a procedure done right away.In general, if symptoms are stable, there usually is time to consider the various choices.A few weeks?"A few days?What would be the consequences of my exploring this option for a few hours?Otherwise, you should question whether you are getting additional opinions as a way to postpone what may be an inevitable need to have surgery. What happens if there's an emergency? Don't hold up your treatment in order to get a second opinion when you are in a life-threatening emergency or where the risk of harm from delaying a procedure outweighs the benefit of taking another look. Say a patient has chest pain that is so persistent and recurrent that it does not respond to medical therapy, even to powerful drugs given intravenously. When a device, called a balloon pump, is inserted, it too barely controls the pain. The individual needs coronary bypass surgery very quickly. The physician recognizes that to wait longer is completely unacceptable. There may be time to explain that to the patient, but there isn't time to spend a couple of days getting another opinion. If a patient is adamant about getting a second opinion, the doctor should make sure that the patient understands what the impact of waiting might be, including how much it increases the chances of having a heart attack or dying. In some cases, there may be time for a relative to talk to another doctor on the phone, but the conversation will need to be brief. How do I know if I have time to get a second opinion? Ask the question directly: "Is there urgency? What would be the consequences of my exploring this option for a few hours? A few days? A few weeks?" In general, if symptoms are stable, there usually is time to consider the various choices. But it can also happen that a patient comes in for diagnostic tests and evaluation, finds out there is a serious illness, and feels compelled to stay in the hospital and have a procedure done right away.Sometimes it's an institutional push—from a business point of view, you are a bird in hand.Sometimes the urgency is accelerated by a patient's fear.Try to calm down and find out if you are in imminent danger.If you aren't, then take the time to evaluate your illness and treatment.Do not be railroaded into making a major decision or just give up under the stress of the diagnosis.

A group of young troublemakers pass by, see the drunkard, and hatch a plan. Breaking through the doors of the fireworks shop, they surround the drunkard with pyrotechnic devices and let them start going off. The drunkard wakes up, bewildered by the fireworks, and begins running about before disappearing in a burst of smoke. The young troublemakers laugh at their prank.

 What is congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty?
Congenital pulmonary stenosis is a health problem present from birth. It’s when the pulmonary valve in your heart doesn’t fully open. Congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty is a type of procedure that aims to fix this problem. It does so without the need for open heart surgery.
The heart’s ventricles are the 2 lower chambers of the heart. The right ventricle pumps blood low in oxygen to the lungs. It connects to the pulmonary artery, the main blood vessel leading to the lungs. Between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is the pulmonary valve. It’s one of the heart’s 4 valves. These valves help the blood flow through the heart’s 4 chambers and out to the body. Normally, the pulmonary valve opens fully when the right ventricle squeezes. It allows the blood to flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery.
Sometimes, a person may have an abnormally thickened or fused valve. The valve might have an abnormal number of small parts, called leaflets. As a result, the valve can’t open as fully as it normally would. As pressure builds up in the right ventricle, the heart has to work harder to push the blood out to the lungs. Over time, this can damage the overworked heart muscle and lead to symptoms. Sometimes, the area around the valve also fails to form correctly.
Balloon valvuloplasty aims to fix the pulmonary valve. The procedure uses a long, thin tube called a catheter. This tube has an inflatable balloon at its tip. The healthcare provider puts this catheter through a blood vessel in the groin and threads it all the way to the pulmonary valve. The balloon is then inflated. It stretches the valve and helps open it up. Then blood can flow out to the pulmonary artery without blockage.
Why might I need congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty?
The purpose of this procedure is to ease the symptoms of congenital pulmonary stenosis. Many people who have this condition will not need valvuloplasty. Mild cases may not lead to any symptoms. But if you have a more moderate case, you may have tiredness and shortness of breath when exercising.
You may not have any symptoms at first. But you may develop them later in childhood or adulthood. People with severe symptoms often need treatment with some sort of procedure or surgery. Treatment is often recommended for pregnant women, especially if the stenosis is more severe.
If you do need a procedure, healthcare providers are most likely to recommend balloon valvuloplasty. It is less invasive than open heart surgery. Recovery is often shorter, too.
No one knows what causes most cases of congenital pulmonary stenosis. It sometimes happens along with Noonan syndrome, a genetic disease. Or it may happen with other heart defects.
What are the risks for congenital pulmonary stenosis valvuloplasty?
There is also a fairly high risk that the valve will partially close again with time. You may need another valvuloplasty or surgery on the valve.
How do I get ready for a congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty?
Ask your healthcare provider about how to get ready for the procedure. You should not eat or drink anything after midnight before the day of the procedure. You may also need to stop taking certain medicines beforehand.
Before the procedure, the hair around the area where the catheter will be inserted may be removed.
What happens during congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty?
You will be given medicine to make you sleepy. But you will be awake.
A numbing medicine will be injected into the area around the groin.
The healthcare provider will make a small incision in the groin to reach a blood vessel.
The healthcare provider will put a flexible thin tube (a catheter) through the incision.
The healthcare provider will move the tube to the pulmonary valve. He or she may use X-ray images to see exactly where the tube is.
The healthcare provider will thread a very thin wire through the tube.
Another tube will be passed over this wire to the pulmonary valve. This tube has a balloon that expands on its end.
The healthcare provider will inflate the balloon. This will stretch the valve leaflets to make the opening bigger. This may hurt a little. But you can have pain medicine.
Once the valve has been opened enough, the balloon will be deflated. Then the healthcare provider will remove the balloon and catheters.
The incision made in the groin will be closed and a dressing applied.
What happens after congenital pulmonary stenosis balloon valvuloplasty?
You may be sleepy and disoriented upon waking.
The team will carefully watch your vital signs, such as your heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure.
You will feel some soreness. But you shouldn’t feel severe pain. Pain medicine is available if needed.
You may need to lie flat for several hours after the procedure without bending your legs. This will help prevent bleeding.
Your healthcare provider might prescribe medicine to keep your blood from clotting (anticoagulants).
Your healthcare provider may order follow-up tests such as an electrocardiogram or an echocardiogram.
You may be able to go home the day after the procedure.
Ask what medicine you need to take. You may temporarily need to take antibiotics or medicine to prevent blood clots. Take pain medicine as needed.
You can resume your normal activities fairly quickly. But avoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting for several days.
Stitches or staples will be removed in a follow-up appointment. Be sure to keep all follow-up visits.
Call your healthcare provider if you have increased swelling, chest pain, increased bleeding or drainage, a fever, or severe symptoms.
Follow all the instructions your healthcare provider gives you about medicine, exercise, diet, and wound care.
Most of the time, symptoms improve right away after balloon valvuloplasty. But you will need lifelong care from a cardiologist. He or she will watch for possible complications from the procedure. Some people will need another valvuloplasty or other procedure in the future.

  unable to reach a high B-Flat note, an orphan fires a slingshot to help finish the song. During the final act, Donald returns to the stage and quickly recites one line &ndash; "Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn" &ndash; and waits for the orphans to interrupt him. Yet as they seem well-behaved this time, Donald continues the recitation. But when he says "Where is that boy who looks after the sheep?" the orphans answer in unison "Under the haystack fast asleep, you dope!" causing Donald to lose his temper again. The orphans tie bricks, a plant, a fire extinguisher and eggs onto their balloons, float them over his head, and fire their slingshots.

  energy and ends up in an excited state associated to some energy level, as seen in the picture. The daughter nucleus can only stay in that excited state for a small amount of time (the half life of the level) after which it suffers a series of gamma transitions to its lower energy levels. These transitions allow the daughter nucleus to emit the excitation energy as one or more gamma rays until it reaches its ground state, thus getting rid of all the excitation energy that it kept from the decay. According to this, the energy levels of the daughter nucleus can be populated in two ways: The total gamma rays emitted by an energy level (IT) should be equal to

 How efficacious are antihistamines Fexofenadine and Loratadine when combined with a decongestant?
Question: My questions deal with allergy treatment. Can you comment on the relative efficacy of the antihistamines fexofenadine and loratadine when combined with a decongestant (Allegra-D vs Claritin-D). Similarly, can you comment on the efficacy of the corticosteroid nasal sprays fluticasone and mometasone (Flonase vs Nasonex). My internist and ENT disagree and I need help....NOW!
In my opinion , both drug Allegra-D & Claritin-D are has equal efficacy but Claritin-D need dose adjustment in both hepatic & renal disease , Allegra-D need dose adjustment only in renal disease . As per your age , i would prefer Allegra-D .
Similarly , both Flonase (fluticasone) & Nasonex (mometasone) both are equally effective but mometasone has more side effect than fluticasone . Hence , i would prefer Flonase for you .

What causes extremely foul smelling burps and gas after taking zonisamide and loratadine?
my son, 11 years has been having extremely foul smelling burps and gas for two weeks. Before this began, his breath had the smell of some sort of medication, much like something in at the dentist. His medications are: Zonisamide 300 mg and Loratadine 10 mg daily. could there be an underlying cause?
What causes thumping heart beats during nights?
57 yrs old great health female, single, divorced. Very fit & health consciouse. Do not drink or smoke. Currently have no health insurance (working on it) as a consultant. Been experiencing bad thumping, heating beating every night from 7 pm until next morning. Sometimes it starts earlier and never stops. Gets worse around 11 pm so unable to sleep as so loud. When I do manage to get a little sleep, it wakes me up with same thing at 4 am and cannot get back to sleep. It also happens during the day. I have no anxiety, and min stress, and highly allergic to medications. Was taking 5mg claritin but too strong. I also have bad ear infections, but unalble to take steriods or antibodicts. This has been ongoing for a year and getting worse and happening every day now. I have gone thru menopause at 53, but possibly still part of it. The only thing I can take is Childrens Benedryl 1 tsp. Sometimes it is skips beats. I suspect food allergies; however, even if I eat nothing, still does it. Worse after eating within a 2 hr period. I have low blood pressure; however high cholestrol as very genic in family. The feeling of a lot of adrenaline pumping, even if not working out. A lot of pressure in the chest as well. I tried bioidential hormones but could not tell any difference. Not taking anything now except B-Complex Sublingual Liquid once a day and the Benedryl if having an allergic reaction.

 Chronic Lyme disease has affected millions of people, getting them disabled, changing their lives, draining their bank accounts, leaving them nothing but hope. Hope for a better life, pain free, with less medication to take and more days to enjoy.
Given that the Lyme disease test is not reliable, most of the patients are being diagnosed only on a later stage of Lyme, when they are already facing a chronic illness which is far more difficult to treat.
Is Lyme disease curable? That’s what everyone asks whenever they hear about this infamous disease. What are the treatment options? What are the alternative treatments?
Among the many treatments offered to the Lyme sufferers, today we will cover the HYPERTHERMIA TREATMENT, considered ground-breaking by some and radical by others.
Hyperthermia has been used a viable alternative cancer treatment. It uses whole-body infrared-A-irradiation to elevate the core temperature of the body. The goal of this treatment is to increase the body’s core temperature to at least 41 ° C (105.8° F), which is the temperature believed to affect many strains of Borreliosis.
Recent research has shown that Hyperthermia seems to be efficient in patients diagnosed with Lyme and co-infections (Bartonella, Mycoplasma) and viruses.
When combined with antibiotics, the success rate is higher. What started as an accidental discovery more than a decade ago in Germany, turned up to be a successful way to kill the spirochetes and not only. Unfortunately, studies revealed it is not effective for Babesia.
During a whole-body hypothermia treatment session, the patient lies down on a bed in a special thermal chamber, similar to a incubator. The entire procedure may take up to six hours in total: two hours to raise the body temperature, two hours maintained at this temperature and two more hours to cool down the body.
During the procedure the patient is closely observed, being hooked up at the monitoring equipment. A sedative is administered using a temporary drip.
The medical literature revealed that Borrelia is thermolabile, meaning that it can not tolerate high temperatures. Thus, at 39° C (or 102.2° F) the spirochetes became immobile, while at 40° C (or 104° F) they shed their outer membrane. Also a two hours exposure to a higher temperature than 41.6° C (or 106.9° F), makes 100 percent of the bacteria die.
By elevating the body’s core temperature up to 42° C, Borrelia bacteria and the micro-organisms try to avoid the heat. While cysts gets released, the bacteria gets destroyed by the antibiotics. Thanks to the heat, the medication’s activity becomes amplified 60-fold. Thus, the supercharged antibiotics are able to penetrate deep into the tissue and kill the bacteria.
Dr Radzi’s Oncology and Hyperthermia Centre in Johor Bahru, Malaysia.
It is recommended that one day prior to the hyperthermia treatment, the patient will fast and undergo a colonic irrigation, to ensure the minimum of toxins within the body.
What is the success rate for this treatment? Over 50 % of patient regain their lives, go back to work and continue a “normal” life. It has been noted that after the treatment, some of the Lyme symptoms (brain fog, tingling in the fingers, fatigue) had disappeared or improved considerably !
Can Lyme be cured by hyperthermia treatment? There are many things so be taken in consideration, as every patient is presenting different symptoms and co-infections.
Hyperthermia combined with additional antimicrobial herbs will help fight any strains left in the patient’s system.
As Lyme is only recently gaining popularity and gets more media coverage, many of the Lyme sufferers who had been forced to go abroad or even overseas to get treatment for this controversial disease, are keeping their fingers crossed, hoping somehow a miracle will happen. With a bit of luck, it might just happen. Maybe, Hyperthermia did not received the recognition it deserves.

  the varying beliefs found among ufo writers over the course of ufo history. Allen Greenfield confessed in Magonia in 1979 he had become disenchanted with the divisive emotionality and groupthink of ufo culture and worried about the influence of belief he eventually saw in his early work advocating the ETH. He was starting to think the bigger mystery was not what ufos were, but "What are we to make of the whole world-wide rumor complex…what are we to make of the rumor – the ufo mythos?" What was the meaning of all the mythologizing that attends the spread of the ufo rumor?

  many of the UFO sightings and other rumors: "The shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel. Commercial pilots cruising over Nevada at dusk would look up and see the bottom of OXCART whiz by at 2,000-plus mph. The aircraft's titanium body, moving as fast as a bullet, would reflect the sun's rays in a way that could make anyone think, UFO." They believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51's actual operations. The veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, although many of Area 51's operations did occur underground.  Bob

  Light distortion from air turbulence can cause celestial bodies to move to a limited degree as can a visual perceptual effect called the autokinetic effect, caused by small, involuntary eye movements after staring at a star-like light against a black background without a frame of reference. To some observers, these may cause stars and planets to appear to start and stop, change direction, or dart around. Hendry and other UFO skeptics attribute complex patterns of apparent motion in UFO reports to the autokinetic effect. Its opposite, autostasis is one of the causes as well. Another type of misperceived motion sometimes occurs when

  Identifying unidentified flying objects is a difficult task due to the normally poor quality of the evidence provided by those who report sighting the unknown object. Observations and subsequent reporting are often made by those untrained in astronomy, atmospheric phenomena, aeronautics, physics, and perception. Nevertheless, most officially investigated UFO sightings, such as from the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, have been identified as being due to honest misidentifications of natural phenomena, aircraft, or other prosaic explanations. In early U.S. Air Force attempts to explain UFO sightings, unexplained sightings routinely numbered over one in five reports. However, in early 1953, right after the CIA's Robertson Panel, percentages of unexplained sightings dropped precipitously, usually being only a few percent in any given year. When Project Blue Book closed down in 1970, only 6% of all cases were classified as being truly unidentified. UFOs that can be explained are sometimes termed "IFOs" or Identified Flying Objects.

  The only difference between hair and fur is semantics. Technically, both are made from keratin, which is also the protein that makes up skin, feathers, nails, hooves, claws, and horns. "'The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles,' says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. 'So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it.'"This remains

  attacks by startling predators. Zebras may possibly use motion dazzle, confusing a predator's attack by moving a bold pattern rapidly. Some animals are coloured for physical protection, with pigments in the skin to protect against sunburn, while some frogs can lighten or darken their skin for temperature regulation. Finally, animals can be coloured incidentally. For example, blood is red because the haem pigment needed to carry oxygen is red. Animals coloured in these ways can have striking natural patterns. Animals produce colour in both direct and indirect ways. Direct production occurs through the presence of visible coloured cells known as pigment which are particles of coloured material such as freckles. Indirect production occurs by virtue of cells known as

   Animal coloration is the general appearance of an animal resulting from the reflection or emission of light from its surfaces. Some animals are brightly coloured, while others are hard to see. In some species, such as the peafowl, the male has strong patterns, conspicuous colours and is iridescent, while the female is far less visible. There are several separate reasons why animals have evolved colours. Camouflage enables an animal to remain hidden from view. Animals use colour to advertise services such as cleaning to animals of other species; to signal their sexual status to other members of the same species; and in mimicry, taking advantage of the warning coloration of another species. Some animals use flashes of colour to

   Some animals are coloured purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm that live in caves may be largely colorless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.

 Puppies and kittens who are 3 weeks or older will do fine for a day or so on a soupy mix of commercial puppy or kitten food and water.** Some kinds of infection in the milk could make the babies sick, too, so prevent them from nursing until after you take your pet to the vet.**Keep the babies from nursing.The trimmed hair sticks to the jelly and washes out.The affected glands swell and become so tender that the mother may refuse to let her babies nurse. The tissue feels hot and hard. It may turn a reddish blue color, come to a head, break open and drain, or even slough tissue. Sometimes, the milk or discharge from the nipples is filled with mucus, turns a yellowish green or bloody color, or becomes stringy. If it is a serious mastitis infection, your pet can develop a high fever, act depressed, or refuse to eat. Pets with mastitis need antibiotics to fight the infection. But in most cases, simple first aid is a good way to relieve pain and speed the healing. ### **MEDICINE CHEST**

Blunt scissors or electric clippers

Water-soluble lubricant (K-Y Jelly)

Milk replacer

Nursing kit

Hot pack or compress

Adhesive bandage

Rectangular piece of fabric

###   **DO THIS NOW**

**Trim surrounding fur. ** Most dogs and cats lose quite a bit of fur on their tummies when they become pregnant, which prepares them for nursing. It's a good idea to trim away any remaining fur to make treating mastitis simpler. When the infection begins to drain, the discharge collects in the fur and can reinfect the breast. Use blunt scissors or electric clippers to cut the fur surrounding the infection close to the skin. If you're using scissors, slip your index and second fingers through the fur. Cut the fur level with your fingers, clipping a 1-inch border around the affected area. (This technique is illustrated on this page.) If the skin is broken, fill the wound with water-soluble lubricant like K-Y Jelly before you clip. Then thoroughly rinse the area with warm water. The trimmed hair sticks to the jelly and washes out. **Keep the babies from nursing. ** Some kinds of infection in the milk could make the babies sick, too, so prevent them from nursing until after you take your pet to the vet. Puppies and kittens who are 3 weeks or older will do fine for a day or so on a soupy mix of commercial puppy or kitten food and water.For dry food, just soak 2 parts in 1 part water until the food gets soft and mushy.Younger babies need to be fed milk with an eyedropper or needleless syringe, but cow's milk doesn't have all the nutrients they need.There are many nutritionally complete commercial milk replacers for puppies and kittens.You can buy a nursing kit at pet-supply stores.

  hence sexual displays come at the expense of health. A bird's feathers undergo wear and tear and are replaced periodically during the bird's life through molting. New feathers, known when developing as blood, or pin feathers, depending on the stage of growth, are formed through the same follicles from which the old ones were fledged. The presence of melanin in feathers increases their resistance to abrasion. One study notes that melanin based feathers were observed to degrade more quickly under bacterial action, even compared to unpigmented feathers from the same species, than those unpigmented or with carotenoid pigments. However, another study the same year compared the action

  endless range of created labels, such as the Puggle (Pug and Beagle cross). There are even complex crosses (with multiple breeds in recent ancestry) being labeled in this manner, such as German Chusky (German Shepherd Dog, Siberian Husky and Chow Chow cross). Like children in a family, a percentage of designer dogs with the same breed ancestry will look similar to each other, even though crossbreeding does not result in as uniform a phenotype as the breeding of purebreds. Often even pups in the same litter will look quite different. Another defining characteristic of designer dogs is that they are usually bred as companion dogs

   Agouti is a type of fur coloration in which each hair displays two or more bands of pigmentation. As a result, the overall appearance of agouti fur is usually gray or dull brown, although dull yellow is also possible. Agouti fur is characterized by an appearance of being composed of hairs of different colors, separate from definite markings (although agouti can appear in combination with other markings, such as spots, stripes or patches). This effect is caused by different portions of each hair being visible, such that different colors of the hair's banding is seen, despite hairs actually having similar coloration. This effect produces a very distinctive, finely "speckled" appearance similar to "salt and pepper" hair, as well as an iridescent effect very similar to shot silk which causes the overall color to appear to shift subtly depending on the angle of the light or when the animal moves. Agouti fur is the wild type pigmentation for many domesticated mammals. It is a highly recognized characteristic trait of several animals, including many wild canids, wild rabbits, and the namesake agouti.

  is determined by the agouti gene which regulates the distribution of melanin. The mechanisms of the gene have been extensively studied in mice to provide an insight into the diversity of mammalian coat patterns. Melanin in arthropods has been observed to be deposited in layers thus producing a Bragg reflector of alternating refractive index. When the scale of this pattern matches the wavelength of visible light, structural coloration arises: giving a number of species an iridescent color. Arachnids are one of the few groups in which melanin has not been easily detected, though researchers found data suggesting spiders do in fact produce melanin.

 ** A hormone called oxytocin is released by the brain and signals your pet's body to begin labor and milk release.**Give her privacy.The puppies or kittens should be removed from nursing for at least 24 hours, or until the mother is stabilized, and they may need to be fed by hand until they're weaned.When given in time, it can reverse all the signs within 15 minutes.**Clip the fur. ** With longhaired dogs and cats, trim the hair around the rear end with blunt scissors or electric clippers. This not only prevents some of the mess of birthing fluids from collecting in the fur but also gets fur out of the way to prevent a puppy or kitten from becoming entangled. ###   **FIRST ALERT**

### **Milk Fever**

When a mother dog or cat does not have enough calcium in her body to support the drain from producing milk, she can develop a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, or milk fever. This usually develops during the first couple of weeks after the birth of the babies, and small-breed dogs with large litters are at highest risk. The affected pet will become very agitated, leave the babies, pace, pant excessively, tremble, walk with a stiff-legged gait, and even develop seizures and collapse. Often, she'll develop a fever of 106°F or higher. Milk fever can cause her lips to stretch back in a bizarre grin because the low calcium causes a kind of tetany that affects the nerves and pulls the muscles in odd ways. Without treatment, the mother can die within only a few hours, so she needs emergency medical treatment as soon as possible. The treatment involves intravenous replacement of calcium, like calcium gluconate. When given in time, it can reverse all the signs within 15 minutes. The puppies or kittens should be removed from nursing for at least 24 hours, or until the mother is stabilized, and they may need to be fed by hand until they're weaned. **Give her privacy. ** A hormone called oxytocin is released by the brain and signals your pet's body to begin labor and milk release.The best way to get things started again is to give the mother some privacy.Shoo away the spectators, shut the door, and let your dog or cat settle down.**Watch for problems.

 velocity is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's displacement (distance from the original position) ; acceleration is the derivative (with respect to time) of an object's velocity, that is, the second derivative (with respect to time) of an object's position. Calculus is of vital importance in physics: many physical processes are described by equations involving derivatives, called differential equations. Physics is particularly concerned with the way quantities change and develop over time, and the concept of the "time derivative" &mdash; the rate of change over time &mdash; is essential for the precise definition of several important concepts. In particular, the time derivatives of an object's position are significant in Newtonian physics:  For example, if an object's position on a line is given by  which is constant.

  the function at that point, provided that the derivative exists and is defined at that point. For a real-valued function of a single real variable, the derivative of a function at a point generally determines the best linear approximation to the function at that point. Differential calculus and integral calculus are connected by the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that differentiation is the reverse process to integration. Differentiation has applications in nearly all quantitative disciplines. In physics, the derivative of the displacement of a moving body with respect to time is the velocity of the body, and the derivative of the velocity with respect to time is acceleration.

  A differential equation is a relation between a collection of functions and their derivatives. An ordinary differential equation is a differential equation that relates functions of one variable to their derivatives with respect to that variable. A partial differential equation is a differential equation that relates functions of more than one variable to their partial derivatives. Differential equations arise naturally in the physical sciences, in mathematical modelling, and within mathematics itself. For example, Newton's second law, which describes the relationship between acceleration and force, can be stated as the ordinary differential equation Here u(x,t) is the temperature of the rod at position x and time t and α is a constant that depends on how fast heat diffuses through the rod.

  As opposed to a vehicle riding along a flat circle, inclined edges add an additional force that keeps the vehicle in its path and prevents a car from being "dragged into" or "pushed out of" the circle (or a railroad wheel from moving sideways so as to nearly rub on the wheel flange). This force is the horizontal component of the vehicle's normal force. In the absence of friction, the normal force is the only one acting on the vehicle in the direction of the center of the circle. Therefore, as per Newton's second law, we can set the horizontal component of the normal force equal to mass multiplied by centripetal acceleration:  This provides the velocity that in the absence of friction and with a given angle of incline and radius of curvature, will ensure that the vehicle will remain in its designated path. The magnitude of this velocity is also known as the "rated speed" (or "balancing speed" for railroads) of a turn or curve. Notice that the rated speed of the curve is the same for all massive objects, and a curve that is not inclined will have a rated speed of 0.

 Several factors are considered in determining the permitted speed for single-unit trucks with emergency braking on horizontal curves during rainy weather conditions. First, the braking distance computation model is established by considering the relationship between brake pedal force, vehicle braking deceleration, and braking time. This model helps determine the amount of distance required for the truck to come to a complete stop in rainy conditions.

Secondly, the driver's sight distance based on real road scenarios is used as a threshold to measure the longitudinal safety of the vehicle. This takes into account the reduced visibility caused by adverse weather conditions such as rain.

Furthermore, the lateral friction and rollover margin are considered to assess the vehicle's lateral stability. The relationship between rainfall intensity, water film thickness, and road friction is established to better predict the safe speed based on information from the weather station.

It is important to note that the road friction factor of the wet pavement not only determines the safe vehicle speed but is also influenced by the vehicle speed itself. Ferrari's method is adopted to solve the quartic equation to determine the permitted vehicle speed.

Finally, the braking and turning maneuvers are considered comprehensively based on the principle of the friction ellipse. This ensures that both lateral and longitudinal stability meet the requirements when the single-unit truck is running at the computed permitted speed.

Overall, these factors are taken into consideration to provide driving guidance for single-unit truck drivers on horizontal curves during rainy weather conditions, as well as serve as a decision-making basis for road managers.

  One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's third law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object. This is incorrect; the third law refers to forces on two different objects. In contrast, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table, both forces acting on the same book. Since the book is not accelerating, these forces must be exactly balanced, according to Newton's second law. They are therefore 'equal and opposite', yet they are acting

  that requires large objectives and travel to dark sky locations. Since these objects are relatively large, they are observed at low magnifications that do not require a clock-driven mount. ; Balance Issues: Designs that have the telescope tube fixed in relationship to its altitude bearings can be put out of balance by the addition or subtraction of equipment such as cameras, finderscopes or even unusually heavy eyepieces. Most Dobsonian telescopes have enough friction in the bearings to resist a moderate amount of imbalance; however, this friction can also make it difficult to position the telescope accurately. To correct such imbalance, counterweights are sometimes hooked or bolted onto the back of the mirror box. The Dobsonian design has the following characteristics:

   In mathematics, differential calculus is a subfield of calculus that studies the rates at which quantities change. It is one of the two traditional divisions of calculus, the other being integral calculus—the study of the area beneath a curve. The primary objects of study in differential calculus are the derivative of a function, related notions such as the differential, and their applications. The derivative of a function at a chosen input value describes the rate of change of the function near that input value. The process of finding a derivative is called differentiation. Geometrically, the derivative at a point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph

These are distinguished by (C). Cured symptoms are bracketed. Some symptoms observed in patients taking the remedy are included in the Schema. The New Eng. Med. Gaz. (quoted by Lambert, H. W., xxxi. 125) published a translation of a pamphlet by Dr. Heinrich Ramm on the uses of "Bean tea." A lady whom Ramm had treated in vain for mitral disease with liver and kidney complications and dropsy, presented herself one day apparently cured by drinking Bean tea. This led Ramm to try it in other cases, and he found that renal and cardiac dropsies were speedily relieved; urine largely increased in quantity, and in cases of albuminuria, the albumen quickly disappeared. Dropsical effusion into pleura, pericardium, and peritoneum, according to Ramm, also yield to it; and all chronic disorders of the urinary tract from kidneys to urethra; pyelitis, vesical catarrh, gravel, calculi, uric acid, he says, quickly disappear; Ramm considers Phas. a most important remedy in gout and in diabetes. Ramm used a decoction of the whole dried ripe pod "of the taller variety." He names it P. vulgaris. [The inside of the pod rubbed on warts is said to cure them.-R. T. C.] We owe to A. M. Cushing (New Eng. Med. Gaz., January, 1897) the best definition of the power and sphere of action of this remedy. He names it from Gray P. nanus, "the common white bean," His paper was read in Boston, and he refers to the "bean-eating city" and to its reputation "for sudden deaths from brain or heart trouble," and for premature ageing of young men. I am not quite sure whether this was jest or earnest, but it points the action of the remedy which in Cushing's proving caused disturbance of the nervous system, genital organs (impotence), stomach, bowels, and kidneys, and this symptom, which brought the proving to an abrupt close: "I suddenly felt a curious sensation in the region of the heart. It was so sudden and strange I immediately felt my pulse, and found it very irregular and feeble, so much so I think I was frightened; at least, I did not take any more of the medicine." "Irregular, weak pulse," "Heart failure," are the chief keynotes of the remedy in heart cases, and correspond with the one heart symptom recorded by Allen. Demeures in his proving experienced severe headache from fulness in the brain. Cushing relates two experiences bearing on this. (1) He gave a decoction of the dried pods in a hopeless case of uterine cancer with severe general dropsy with apparent relief. Calling one day and expecting to find the patient comfortable, he found her dead. "She suddenly screamed, 'Oh, my head!' grasped it with both hands and was dead." (2) A lady doctor, 30, married, no children, never ill except with children's diseases, had had much mental trouble two years before, and had done much cycling. Since then her heart had given trouble. About five times in a minute the heart would give one hard, unpleasant throb, then omit one beat. During the night it was much worse and prevented sleep. Phas. 10 was given. Thirty-six hours later the heart would beat a hundred heats without varying, and improvement continued; but the patient had to give up the remedy on account of the headache it caused, "as if something were pressing hard against each temple", much worse after each close of the medicine. The patient was never subject to headaches. Other cases of Cushing's were: (3) Man, 45, dropsy, heart, and other complications. Bean pod decoction enabled him to lie down on a couch, and markedly diminished the dropsy. (4) Clergyman, 69, many years invalided on account of heart disease, after unusual exertion was greatly exhausted, and became entirely pulseless, and so remained four days in spite of treatment till Phas. 9x was given. In a few hours pulse returned. In thirty-six hours it was regular and strong, and so remained till his death, which occurred two weeks later. (5) Lady, 50, weak, tired, badly acting heart for some years. Phas. 9x was given, and in forty-eight hours "her heart wheeled into line all right and remains so." (6) Lady, 87, heart acted badly, every third beat omitted. After taking Phas. two days pulse quite right. (7) Confinement case, primapara, urine loaded with albumen, frightful convulsions, forceps delivery. Two hours later the heart failed and no stimulants would start it. Phas. 9x was given, and in ten minutes the heart was all right. Twice in the night the dose had to be repeated, but that was all. The albumen rapidly disappeared and a quick recovery was made. (8) Man, 92, had been passing bloody urine (apparently as much blood as urine) for a week. Had previously had urinary troubles, urinating several times in the night, and passing catheter twice in twenty-four hours; but for a little time past had not had to use the catheter. Cushing diagnosed prostatic trouble and gave Phas. 4x, No. 25 globules in water, a teaspoonful every two hours. (9) Another case of prostatic haemorrhage in a man, 70, was cured by Phas. 4x globules dry on the tongue. Well in four days. (10) Cushing gives an interesting account (Med. Vis., xiii. 375) of Phas. as a vulnerary. Fifty years ago he accidentally ran one tine of a hay fork into the top of his foot. A backwoods doctor promised to have him all right next day. He split a medium-sized white bean, bound one half, the flat, split side, on the wound. The pain was so severe Cushing became delirious, went to sleep, and woke well. In forty-one years of practice he has tried it in punctured wounds by rivets, nails, &c., and with perfect success every time. (11) A lady, 30, took a tablet containing gr. 12 1/2 of Morphine placed in the middle of a baked bean with suicidal intent. It was in the evening, having fasted since noon. She went to sleep and woke at 7 a.m. next morning, surprised to find herself in this world. She slept again till 11 a.m., when she had to get up, but could not walk. A doctor was sent for. She vomited a little mucus, some dark specks like blood, and a small piece of lettuce, eaten the previous noon. Query: Did Phas. antidote Morph.? (12) Robust man, 50, had grippe, which developed rheumatism, worse in arms, occasionally below elbows. Pain so severe he could not lie in bed at nights. Drank much water. Passed much urine, which Cushing found to contain 3.5 per cent. of sugar. Phas. 5x every four hours removed all but a trace of sugar in eight days, and the patient was in other respects well. S. R. Stone (Amer. Hom., xxiv. 123) reports the case of Mr. T., 69, whom he found semi-conscious, yet suffering severely, having been seized with distress in heart region; respiration laboured; pulse 5l. Had had attacks previously, but lighter, and the pulse in them had always been slow. Phas. 6x was given, at first every half-hour, then every hour. Next day patient was nearly well, and said he "could feel every dose working." In a case reported by Cushing, a nurse, 50, "had fearful time with her heart palpitating and feeling as if she should die;" Phas. 15x cured. Patient "never took anything in her life that did her so much good" (H. R., xii. 237). Remarkable symptoms of the proving were: Soreness to touch-eyeballs, right rib, epigastrium, right humerus. The headache was < by movement of the head or any mental exertion, reading, writing, &c. Pressure in bed, < again 10 a.m. next day.-Pain r. side forehead while writing.-Severe headache, as if something pressing hard against each temple, much < after each dose of Phas. (in patient cured of heart symptoms, not a subject of headaches).-Suddenly screamed, "Oh, my head!" grasped it with both hands, and was dead (in cancer case taking a decoction of Phas., including dried pod, C).
3. Eyes.-Eyeballs (esp. r.) painful to touch as from a blow.-Scalding pain in r. orbit.-Pain in r. orbit when wrinkling skin of forehead.-Very smart itching in inner canthi.-Pain over r. orbit < by any mental exertion.-Pupils widely dilated and insensible (D).
6. Face.-Features expressed suffering (D).
12. Abdomen.-Pressure on abdomen apparently gave pain, child shrank from it and drew up legs (D).-Pain like hernia in r. inguinal ring, lasting all day.
14. Urinary Organs.-Bloody urine.-Diabetes.-Uric acid gravel.
15. Male Sexual Organs.-Complete impotence (C).-Prostate, enlargement of.

 He is able to exercise without symptoms.He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting.He has overall felt well, but checks his pulse after exercising and thinks he has noticed that his heart occasionally skips a beat.A 66-year-old male is evaluated in a physician's office for ongoing medical care.The usual rate of ventricular tachycardia is significantly higher than 120 beats per minute.Six hours after the procedure, the patient is recovering in the intensive care unit (ICU); his cardiac monitor shows wide and bizarre QRS complexes with a heart rate of 90 beats per minute. BP is 145/82. The patient is comfortable and in no acute distress. When asked, he denies palpitations or other symptoms. ### **Idioventricular Rhythm (Accelerated)**

This patient is experiencing an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. This arrhythmia is generated by the ventricles and occurs when a normally suppressed ventricular "pacemaker" begins to control cardiac rate instead of the SA or AV nodes. Idioventricular rhythm is considered to be "accelerated" when the rate is greater than 40 beats per minute (intrinsic ventricular rate). The most common scenario for this to occur is after coronary reperfusion (restoration of flow to ischemic cardiac tissue) as in the case vignette. The condition is benign, usually not apparent to the patient, and does not require any treatment. Normal SA node function generally returns within 24 to 48 hours of reperfusion therapy. ECG monitoring is imperative, as the condition needs to be differentiated from ventricular tachycardia, which can convert to ventricular fibrillation, a life-threatening arrhythmia. The rate of idioventricular rhythm is less than 120 beats per minute and more commonly less than 100 beats per minute. The usual rate of ventricular tachycardia is significantly higher than 120 beats per minute. A 66-year-old male is evaluated in a physician's office for ongoing medical care. He has overall felt well, but checks his pulse after exercising and thinks he has noticed that his heart occasionally skips a beat. He denies dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting. He is able to exercise without symptoms.Physical examination is without abnormality.ECG/cardiac rhythm strip is obtained and is significant for a repeating pattern of progressive PR interval prolongation over 2 to 4 beats, with a subsequent "dropped" ventricular beat.### **Heart Block**

This patient has second-degree AV heart block, Type I, also known as "Mobitz I" or "Wenckebach periodicity."

 Abnormal Heart Rhythm is a condition in which the heart does not beat in a normal rhythm. A heart rhythm is controlled by the electrical conduction system which causes the chambers of the heart to contract and pump blood in a steady efficient manner enabling to maintain a normal blood pressure and good blood circulation. An abnormal heart rhythm results when the electrical conduction system is damaged or stimulated abnormally due to certain diseases and disorders. The normal electrical sequence begins in the right atrium and spreads throughout the atria to the atrioventricular (AV) node from where the electrical impulses travel down a group of specialized fibers called the His-Purkinje system to all parts of the ventricles. This same route must be followed for the heart to pump properly but when this route is disrupted then we have an irregular heart rhythm. An abnormal heart rhythm is also known as a cardiac arrhythmia or an ectopic heartbeat. An irregular heart rhythm is called a cardiac arrhythmia when it occurs continuously and an abnormal heart rhythm is called an ectopic heartbeat when there are small changes in an otherwise normal heartbeat those leads to extra or skipped heartbeats.
Supraventricular tachycardia occurs in the upper chambers of the heart.
Ventricular tachycardia occurs in the ventricles of the heart.
Sinus tachycardia an increase in the heart rate in a state over excitement or when sick and the heartbeat returns to normal once you calm down or get better.
Atrial Fibrillation (AF): It is a disorganized heart rhythm which occurs in the upper chambers of the heart. Atrial fibrillation occurs when many unstable electrical impulses quiver out of control.
Atrial Flutter (AFL): It t typically occurs in the right atrium and is caused by a single electrical impulse that travels rapidly in the affected atrium.
Bradycardia: In this condition the heart beats at a slower rate, that is, less than 60 beats per minute.
Ventricular fibrillation: It is an erratic, disorganized firing of impulses from the ventricles causing a lack of blood transportation to different parts of the body.
Premature Contraction: The pulse when taken in the wrist or chest in case of premature contractions appears to skip a beat and the skipped beat is so faint or weak that it is not heard or felt.
When coronary arteries become blocked by cholesterol and other deposits.
Some medications may cause the heart rate to change.
Medications: In many cases abnormal heart rhythms can be treated with a variety of medications, such as beta blockers, antiarrhythmias or calcium channel blockers.

Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid.

Typically, when a parent nucleus beta-decays into its daughter, there is some final energy available which is shared between the final products of the decay. This is called the Q value of the beta decay (Qβ). The daughter nucleus doesn't necessarily end up in the ground state after the decay, this only happens when the other products have taken all the available energy with them (usually as kinetic energy).

 The process for fabricating wood-inorganic composites using the standing tree slow-release drip method involves the utilization of the transpiration of bionic trees to achieve the self-assembly of inorganic precursors in wood formation. In the described study, a 10-year-old poplar tree was chosen, and a solvent or sol containing SiO2 precursor was diffused into the xylem using the slow-release drip method. This method allows the inorganic precursors to mix with the moisture present in the xylem, leading to reactions like hydrolysis, polycondensation, and self-assembly within the wood.

Microscopic observation showed that the resulting inorganic substances were yellowish brown and widely distributed in vessels, wood fibers, and ray cells. The newly grown wood exhibited certain changes, such as an increase in fiber-tissue ratio and cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in vessel diameter and tissue ratio. These changes were found to be dependent on the concentration of the precursors used.

Analysis using EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) confirmed the presence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) in the sediments within the wood cells. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) analysis further demonstrated the presence of silicon oxide in the newly formed wood, indicating the successful fabrication of wood-inorganic composites using the standing tree slow-release drip technology.

Overall, this method harnesses the natural processes of the tree's transpiration and wood formation to induce the fabrication of inorganic composites within the wood structure.

 What is injectable nutrient therapy?
Injectable nutrient therapy (INT) is a medical treatment by which sterile solutions of vitamins, minerals and other naturally occurring nutritive substances are infused directly into the blood stream, or injected directly into the muscle tissue.
Who is a candidate for injectable nutrient therapy?
Anyone who is looking to enhance their wellness, improve their body’s natural functions, address deficiencies in nutrients, or hasten the body’s recovery from injury, overtraining, or stress.
To set up an injectable nutrient therapy, call Pacific Psychiatry Psychiatric Intervention and Wellness Center’s staff to arrange a free medical clearance evaluation from one of the providers.
Immediately following the medical clearance evaluation, you will be able to select from the INT menu and begin treatment, depending on whether or not any restrictions to the INT menu were discovered during the medical screening.

 3 -0.27345 The process for fabricating wood-inorganic composites using the standing tree slow-release drip method involves the utilization of the transpiration of bionic trees to achieve the self-assembly of inorganic precursors in wood formation. In the described study, a 10-year-old poplar tree was chosen, and a solvent or sol containing SiO2 precursor was diffused into the xylem using the slow-release drip method. This method allows the inorganic precursors to mix with the moisture present in the xylem, leading to reactions like hydrolysis, polycondensation, and self-assembly within the wood.

Microscopic observation showed that the resulting inorganic substances were yellowish brown and widely distributed in vessels, wood fibers, and ray cells. The newly grown wood exhibited certain changes, such as an increase in fiber-tissue ratio and cell wall thickness, as well as a decrease in vessel diameter and tissue ratio. These changes were found to be dependent on the concentration of the precursors used.

Analysis using EDS (Energy-dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy) confirmed the presence of carbon (C), oxygen (O), silicon (Si), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) in the sediments within the wood cells. XPS (X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) analysis further demonstrated the presence of silicon oxide in the newly formed wood, indicating the successful fabrication of wood-inorganic composites using the standing tree slow-release drip technology.

Overall, this method harnesses the natural processes of the tree's transpiration and wood formation to induce the fabrication of inorganic composites within the wood structure.

  Natural explosions can occur for a variety of reasons. Post-mortem explosions, like that of a beached whale, are the result of the build-up of natural gases created by methane-producing bacteria inside the carcass during the decomposition process. Natural explosions which occur while an animal is living may be defense-related. A number of toads in Germany and Denmark exploded in April 2005. The Los Angeles Herald in 1910 reported a duck which exploded after consuming yeast.

  The safety testing of explosives involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and safety in use. It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of explosives. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, PETN is considered to be a primary explosive by some individuals, and

  Many common powders made in industry are combustible; particularly metals or organic materials such as flour. Since powders have a very high surface area, they can combust with explosive force once ignited. Facilities such as flour mills can be vulnerable to such explosions without proper dust mitigation efforts. Some metals become especially dangerous in powdered form, notably titanium.

No actual missile shield has been subjected to an aircraft impact test. However, a highly similar test was done at Sandia National Laboratories and filmed (see Containment building), and the target was essentially undamaged (reinforced concrete is strongly resistant both to impact and to fire). The NRC's Chairman has said "Nuclear power plants are inherently robust structures that our studies provide adequate protection in a hypothetical attack by an airplane. The NRC has also taken actions that require nuclear power plant operators to be able to manage large fires or explosions - no matter what has caused them."

  although multiple possibilities have been suggested. Some purported risks of abortion are promoted primarily by anti-abortion groups, but lack scientific support. For example, the question of a link between induced abortion and breast cancer has been investigated extensively. Major medical and scientific bodies (including the WHO, National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society, Royal College of OBGYN and American Congress of OBGYN) have concluded that abortion does not cause breast cancer. Position statements of major medical bodies on abortion and breast cancer include: In the past even illegality has not automatically meant that the abortions were unsafe.

  In February 1993, a man drove his car past a check point at the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant, then broke through an entry gate. He eventually crashed the car through a secure door and entered the Unit 1 reactor turbine building. The intruder, who had a history of mental illness, hid in a building and was not apprehended for four hours. Stephanie Cooke asks: "What if he'd been a terrorist armed with a ticking bomb?" After 9/11, it would seem prudent for nuclear plants to be prepared for an attack by a large, well-armed terrorist group. But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in revising its security rules, decided not to require that plants be able to defend themselves against groups carrying sophisticated weapons.

 Getting Pregnant While on Prescription Medications: Is it Safe?
This is because during pregnancy, everything that a woman puts into her body is passed down to her unborn baby. Some prescription medications are safe during pregnancy and will do no harm to a fetus, but some prescription medications can cause grave damage to a pregnancy. Keep reading for more information on prescriptions, pregnancy, and how the two mix.
It would be convenient if there were an easy yes or no answer as to whether or not it is safe to get pregnant while on prescription medications. However, the answer is not black and white. There is no answer that covers all prescription medications.
Here in the USA, doctors and researchers from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have set up a system for categorizing drugs in regards to pregnancy. The categories are A,B,C,D and X, and each one is a different safety level in regards to use during pregnancy.
Category A drugs are drugs that are safe to take during pregnancy. These drugs have undergone extensive testing in both humans and animals and are thought to be safe for pregnant women to take. Some examples of these drugs are folic acid and Tylenol for pain.
Category B drugs are drugs that show no risk to animals during testing. These medications may or may not have been tested on humans. Sometimes category B drugs were proven safe for animal fetuses, but have not been tested on humans.
Other times, category B drugs have been proven dangerous for animals, but safe for humans. Some examples of category B drugs are some antibiotics like Amoxicillin, Glucophage for diabetes, and some types of insulin.
Category C drugs are drugs that have shown to have adverse effects in animals, or no animal studies have been done. Category C drugs might also have had no human testing done, or the benefits to humans might outweigh the risks. Some examples of category C drugs are things like Diflucan for yeast infections, Zoloft and Prozac for depression.
Category D drugs are drugs that have shown to pose risks to unborn babies. However, the benefits in taking Category D drugs have usually been proven to outweigh the risks. Some examples of category D drugs are things like Paxil for depression, Lithium for bipolar disorder, and some chemotherapy drugs for cancer treatments.
Category X drugs are drugs that pose significant risks to unborn babies, and should not be taken during pregnancy under any circumstances. These medicines include Accutane for acne and Thalomid for skin disorders.
As you can see, the topic of prescription medication during pregnancy is a deep and broad one, one that requires plenty of research and careful thinking before taking any medicines during pregnancy. If you have a question about whether or not a certain medication is safe during pregnancy, it is always a good idea to ask your doctor just to be on the safe side.

In World War I British soldier John Carmichael was awarded the Victoria Cross for saving his men by putting his steel helmet over a grenade and then standing on the helmet to reduce the blast damage. Carmichael survived although it was several years before he recovered sufficiently to be discharged from hospital. Company Sergeant Major John Robert Osborn was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross when he threw himself on the bomb to smother the explosion and to save the lives of several Canadian soldiers in the Battle of Hong Kong.

 Common Pregnancy Allergies – What are the Best Treatments?
What Are Some of the Common Pregnancy Allergies?
Ah Spring - Ah-Choo! Allergies can be a real bother. Runny nose, itchy eyes, scratching in places almost to the point of bleeding, coughing and skin rashes are all associated with allergic reactions. An allergy is defined as an exaggerated immune system response to contact with a foreign substance. For people who do not have an allergic response, life can be a breeze - but for those who do, such things as dust mites, pollen, molds, animal dander and certain foods can create a physical reaction that can be most unpleasant. If this is you - then you are "allergic" and you are part of a group of about 50 million North Americans who are affected by allergic conditions.
The most common allergic condition is allergic rhinitis, or hay fever - the seasonal nasal runny nose, sneezing, and itchy eyes that comes along with pollens. If you suffer with these allergy symptoms year round, then there are other allergens affecting the condition. You may experience itchy ears, nose and throat, post nasal drip and a stuffy nose that just won't clear no matter how hard you blow it.
Food allergies can cause rashes such as hives, which are itchy, raised welts. Medications can also cause hives. Anaphylactic shock, a life-threatening allergic reaction, can affect several organs during an episode. This allergic response usually comes from a food allergy (certain nuts or melons are common causes), or through an injection (bee sting). Hives, nasal congestion, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, swelling in the throat, shortness of breath, low blood pressure or shock, and in some cases, even death, are all symptoms of this allergic reaction.
Skin allergies, often the result of grasses, weeds, soaps and perfumes, as well as certain fibers like wool, manifest as allergic eczema with itching, rashes, and dry skin. Latex, dyes in fabric, metals, chemicals and cosmetics are all sources of allergic contact dermatitis, inflammation of the skin that is touched by any of these substances.
When a woman is pregnant, allergies take on a whole new perspective as dealing with them can become quite a challenge. There are, of course, myriad allergy products and allergy treatments to address the symptoms, but some of them may not be suitable for a pregnant woman, possibly causing harm to her unborn baby. Allergy testing is usually deferred during pregnancy because the risk of anaphylaxis is present and if a woman experiences anaphyactic shock, there is a reduction in blood and oxygen to the baby, possibly causing serious problems.
According to the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), no drugs are considered to be totally safe during pregnancy. However, the FDA has assigned risk categories to medications based on use in pregnancy. In pregnancy category A, there are medications that have shown to be safe through good studies in pregnant women in the first trimester. There are very few medications in this category. Category B have good animal studies but no human studies are available. Pregnancy category C medication can have negative results in animal testing, but the benefits may outweigh the risks in humans. Category D show definite risk to animal fetuses but, again, in humans the benefits may outweigh the risks. Category X is a no-go zone. They definitely have serious risks for birth defects in both animals and humans.
Before any allergy treatment is pursued, there must be a thorough discussion of the potential risks of allergy products to the pregnant woman and her baby. There are several allergy journals available online that give a list of drugs and treatments. Most allergy treatments should be avoided during pregnancy. Some allergy shots carry a risk of anaphylaxis during pregnancy, resulting in trauma to the mother and harm to the baby. Medicated nasal sprays, most falling in category B, are safe for a woman to use - but check the category first. There are some containing steroids that fall into category C, unsafe. Decongestants should be avoided for the first trimester, and are classified as category C. Anti-histamines, a preferred method of dealing with allergic rhinitis during pregnancy are mostly category B and can be used. Rhinitis of pregnancy does not respond well to most allergy medications, but the use of nasal saline can be very effective. It is safe, salt water, and works well. It is probably the best way to deal with the stuffy nose and sneezing that is attendant allergies when a woman is pregnant.

A follow up study of the effects of the meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area. While the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki demonstrated that the urban area of glass breakage is nearly 16 times greater than the area of significant structural/building damage, although improved building codes since then may contribute to better building survival, there would be a higher likelihood of glass breakage and therefore potential injury/death for people near windows because many modern buildings have larger windows.

  or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out. Low-emissivity or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation. “Superwindows,” mentioned in Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution, became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and

  therefore have an entire wall that is made of glass, half of which is a floor to ceiling sliding-glass door. The living room actually has three such doors because there is so much glass. When this home was built, insulated glass was not as common as it is today - especially for windows as large as 8½ by 10 feet - and so all the glazing in the house is 1/4" plate glass, with an R-value of 1. Replacing it all with insulated glass to save energy would have a payback period several times the warranty for the new glazing - which has a perimeter seal between its two or more panes, subject to eventual failure.  The original glass, which has no such failure mode, remains clear after 50 years.

  Armor Glass International, Inc. was founded by Michael Fjetland, BBA/JD, to "armor glass" under the trademark Armor Glass® to provide security from breach of the glass by natural disasters, explosions, burglars, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, golf balls or other harmful events. One of the main products offered by this company is security film. This type of film is 8 mil thick, is rated for a Large Missile Impact (Level C 4.5 lb.) and is placed on the inside of a window or other source of glass, the weakest link of every building, to create a more durable and defensive layer. Studies have shown that breach of a window by wind-borne debris hurled by hurricane-force winds is what leads to roof uplift and structural collapse. This protective film is used on many buildings in Washington D.C. such as the Pentagon, Smithsonian, Congress, etc. but is also used commercially throughout the world for any person or company striving for extra protection against specific unpredictable encounters.

  heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install. Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home. Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between

 There’s no end to new information about vitamin D, skin cancer, and sun protection factor (SPF) levels in sunscreen. Sun-related topics take on special importance for people with lupus. Here are five facts that will help you be safer in the sun.
UV rays are not all the same. When we talk about sun exposure, what we really mean is exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation. UV-A and UV-B are the types that most often penetrate the ozone layer to reach Earth. UV-A can trigger cutaneous lupus, and can cause flares of existing systemic lupus, says Andrew Franks Jr., MD. “UV-B is shorter—it’s the ‘burning’ ray that can damage DNA and cells. UV-A is longer and can penetrate more deeply into the middle layer of the skin,” says David Fiorentino, MD, PhD.
UV rays are stronger when ozone is low, when they are reflected off of sand, snow or water, and at high altitude.
UV reaction can take many forms. People with lupus need to be aware of UV photosensitivity. “Photosensitivity could mean a systemic response, like feeling sick, having chills, fever, even joint pain, or that you sunburn more easily,” Fiorentino says. Sometimes, though, the photosensitivity reaction may not be visible. UV-A rays can affect the DNA in the blood vessels without causing a sunburn or other external signs of the exposure. “You don’t necessarily know when the damage has been done until it’s too late,” Franks warns.
There’s no such thing as a “safe” tan from UV light. One of the most dangerous myths about UV rays is that damage occurs only after a sunburn. The idea that a “base tan” will prevent burning and, therefore, prevent illness is particularly troublesome. “Any time you have a tan, it means your skin is trying to protect itself from further damage by producing melanin,” Fiorentino says. Tanning beds, which use UV-A rays, are especially dangerous. To date, at least 44 states and the District of Columbia regulate indoor tanning for minors, while 16 states ban the use of UV tanning devices by anyone under age 18. Other state laws combine various restrictions.
For a tanned look, tanning products are the way to go. Cosmetic bronzers wash off like regular makeup; sunless tanners temporarily stain the skin. But remember: The “tan” you get with these products does not provide UV protection.
Vitamin D doesn't have to come from the sun. For people with lupus, vitamin D is a real concern. “It’s high on everyone’s radar and with good reason,” Fiorentino says. “UV-B is required for the body to make vitamin D, so if you use sunscreen or clothing that decreases your UV-B exposure, you decrease the vitamin D that your body makes.” To meet your daily vitamin D requirement without spending extra time in the sunlight, you can eat foods with vitamin D or take vitamin supplements. For most people, the National Institutes of Health recommends 600 international units (IUs) per day, though your doctor may recommend up to 1,000 IUs. “It’s much easier and safer to supplement with vitamins, especially since it’s hard to recommend any sun exposure beyond what people with lupus get in day-to-day life,” Fiorentino says.
Effective sun protection requires more than sunscreen. The sun is the primary outdoor source of UV light, but UV rays can also affect you indoors and in cars. “The biggest risk is often when the sun comes through windows,” Fiorentino explains. While glass does block UV-B transmission, most UV-A gets through. Tinting for car windows is regulated state by state; check with your motor vehicle department. Window film for your home is also available from various manufacturers.
Talk to your doctor about any other steps you can take to limit your UV exposure.

  It has better thermal stability, higher resistance to crazing (when a network of very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has a better ability to be reworked hot and it is known for its superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machinings, such as turning on Engine Lathe or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and much coolant, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.

 Furthermore, in another chance finding, postoperative patients who had undergone spinal surgery reported less stress and lower pain levels, and used 22 percent less pain medication than post-op patients placed in rooms on the other side of the hospital—the side that happened to have 46 percent less natural light.While a view to nature can obviously enhance the mood and cognitive performance of employees, simply allowing sunshine into the interior space has been associated with increased job satisfaction, well-being, and intent to stay with an organization. Importantly, these latter findings were above and beyond illumination per se. In other words, it had nothing to do with brightness; it was letting some sunshine in that really mattered. In health-care settings, windows provide a bridge to the outside world. In her nursing manuals, Florence Nightingale made specific references to the benefits of natural light and fresh air afforded by windows. She stated that there should be a maximum of two beds per window, and that patients should be elevated as much as possible so that they could see outside. She writes, "Window-blinds can always moderate the light of a light ward; but the gloom of a dark ward is irremediable." Further, patients should "see out of a window from their beds, to see sky and sun-light." Studies from 1996 and 2001 have shown that high levels of natural sunlight can expedite recovery and reduce the length of hospital stays in patients with either major depression or bipolar disorder. In patients treated after a heart attack, those who were assigned rooms with high amounts of natural light were more likely to recover faster, and amazingly, there was a 7 percent difference in mortality rates in favor of the rooms with high levels of natural light. Furthermore, in another chance finding, postoperative patients who had undergone spinal surgery reported less stress and lower pain levels, and used 22 percent less pain medication than post-op patients placed in rooms on the other side of the hospital—the side that happened to have 46 percent less natural light.Patients and hospital employees alike rank windows high on the list of desirable building features; of course, the view from those windows is also an important part of the equation.We have come a long way since Florence Nightingale's advice, and now bedside windows are often mandated by government regulations for hospital stays beyond one day.

 Antihistamines are most effective at reducing or abolishing weal and flare, although not immediate or delayed erythema [73, 77].###### First line

One-third of patients respond completely, and one-third partially, to non-sedating H1 antihistamines, with the remainder having no response [10, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76].Detailed knowledge of the wavelength dependency of photosensitivity is critical for patient management and monitoring of responses. The action spectrum may change within patients over time, reinforcing the need for follow-up phototesting [66, 67]. If the condition is severe and unresponsive to treatment, intradermal testing with irradiated autologous serum and/or plasma may help indicate whether there might be a beneficial response to plasmapheresis but is only positive in the minority [3]. ###### Management

Anxiety and depression are common in SU and psychological support may be needed [68, 69]. Photoprotection alone is usually inadequate, unless the symptoms are mild, but is nevertheless important. Behavioural sun avoidance and the use of layered, tightly woven, dark clothing and broad-brimmed hats are advised. Window film may be useful at home, work or on car windows. Photoprotective window film blocks UVA transmission but as many patients are also sensitive to visible light [33, 34, 35, 36], it may not suffice. Attention to dietary vitamin D intake and, if necessary, supplementation is important. The majority of patients gain some benefit from broad-spectrum, high protection factor sunscreens, although the addition of reflectant sunscreens such as Dundee creams (Tayside Pharmaceuticals), which offer protection in the shorter parts of the visible spectrum, may be helpful [3, 70]. ###### First line

One-third of patients respond completely, and one-third partially, to non-sedating H1 antihistamines, with the remainder having no response [10, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]. Antihistamines are most effective at reducing or abolishing weal and flare, although not immediate or delayed erythema [73, 77].The addition of an H2 antagonist may provide additional benefit [79].There is variation between patients in responses to the different antihistamines and often several must be tried and at higher doses than those required to block histamine alone, in order to find an effective regimen.

  Most blind and visually impaired students now attend their neighborhood schools, often aided in their educational pursuits by regular teachers of academics and by a team of professionals who train them in alternative skills: Orientation and Mobility (O and M) training - instruction in independent travel - is usually taught by contractors educated in that area, as is Braille. Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do. Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable vision, many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes. A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student and solid academics goes a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

  The subject of blindness and education has included evolving approaches and public perceptions of how best to address the special needs of blind students. The practice of institutionalizing the blind in asylums has a history extending back over a thousand years, but it was not until the 18th century that authorities created schools for them where blind children, particularly those more privileged, were usually educated in such specialized settings. These institutions provided simple vocational and adaptive training, as well as grounding in academic subjects offered through alternative formats. Literature, for example, was being made available to blind students by way of embossed Roman letters.

 There are an estimated 30,000 blind or partially sighted children and young people in Britain. Problems with sight usually develop before a baby is born when parts of the eyes or nerves fail to develop correctly. The brain usually receives images through nerves and without them functioning correctly, the it is unable to process the images, causing vision impairment or blindness.
The three most common causes of severe visual impairment and blindness in children are: Cerebral visual impairment, disorders of the optic nerve, and disorders of the Retina.
* Bright lights causing discomfort.
Children will be having regular eye tests with health professionals, however if you have any concerns it is important to seek advice and further testing immediately.
Children with sight loss can feel isolated during a period in their lives that is often more than tough already.
With the right support, they can take part in exciting activities, develop friendships and have fun growing up without feeling excluded.
The areas to encouragement development are: Social & Emotional, Communication, Cognitive, Fine Motor and Gross Motor skills.
Learning spacial awareness and problem solving will be particularly valuable, as well as developing excellent listening and attention skills. These are all useful in understanding your environment and the daily sounds around them to help make sense of their world.
Make a sensory play area, this can be any space where the child feels comfortable and where they are in control, even their bedroom. The child can manipulate the toys and other objects. Their voices will sound louder and different in the confined space providing more stimulation.
Introduce Braille for communication and reading purposes, there are plenty of excellent childrens books printed in Braille or audio tapes will develop listening and concentration.
Messy play encourages the use of their hands, fine motor skills and learning through touch and using other senses.
Make Developmental Charts for your Child to encourage development in the 5 areas.

 The act of playing is an important tool that influences a child’s life. The primary goals of childhood are to grow, learn, and play. It is often through play that children learn to make sense of the world around them. It is a child’s “job” or “occupation” to play to develop physical coordination, emotional maturity, social skills to interact with other children, and self-confidence to try new experiences and explore new environments. Our Occupational Therapists have expertise in evaluating children's neurological, muscular, and emotional development, and determining the effects of infant and childhood illness on growth and development. Many of our patients suffer from Sensory Processing Disorder. This results from difficulties in how the nervous system receives, organizes, and uses sensory information from the body and environment. One person may over-respond to input from clothing, physical contact, sounds, lights, and food, while another person may under-respond by showing very little reaction to stimulation, or even to pain. Difficulties in sensory processing may impact organization of behavior, self-care activities, motor planning, self-regulation, and social skills.
What is an Occupational Therapy Evaluation?
An occupational therapy program is designed after a complete evaluation. Many tools are used for the evaluation. Some are standardized (scored on a statistical standard) and some are criterion referenced (performances are judged on an average performance scale for a specific age group). Another form is clinical observation: the Occupational Therapist looks at the style and form with which the child does specific tasks.
What can I expect during the evaluation?
Autism is a developmental disability that affects how the brain functions, specifically those areas of the brain that control social ability and communication skills. Boys are more likely to develop autism, and most children are diagnosed before the age of three. Children and adults with autism typically have difficulty in both verbal and nonverbal communication. People with autism may have a difficult time relating to the outside world and may have unusual reactions to the people around them. People with autism may demonstrate aggressive behavior that may cause injury to themselves or others. The disorder also may cause sensitivity to the senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. Occupational therapy can provide intervention that helps children to develop appropriate social, play, and learning skills. The therapist aids the child in achieving and maintaining normal daily tasks such as getting dressed and playing with other children.
What can parents and families do?
Join a support group for parents and families of children with autism. Families of people with autism can experience high levels of stress because of the child’s challenging behavior and the financial demands.
Collaborate with the Occupational Therapist and other medical and educational professionals to encourage improvement in social skills and daily tasks.
What can occupational therapists do?
Evaluate a child to determine if she or he has accomplished tasks appropriate to the child's age such as dressing and play skills.
Provide intervention to help child appropriately respond to information coming through the senses. Intervention may include developmental activities, sensory integration, and play activities.
Facilitate play activities that aid a child in interacting and communicating with others.

Occupational Therapists have expertise in evaluating children’s neurological, muscular, and emotional development, and determining the effects of infant and childhood illness on growth and development.
Encourage exploratory play by using balls, sand and water toys, slides, swings, finger paints, and magnets. During exploratory play, children use their senses as they explore, discover, examine, and organize their activities.
Try manipulative play by asking the child to perform a task, such as stacking cereal boxes, slipping coins into a piggy bank, or playing with a deck of cards. Handling items such as puzzles, pegboards, beads, and lacing cards test the child’s eye and hand coordination and dexterity.
Suggest imaginative or symbolic play that includes role-playing, playing with dolls and stuff animals, toy furniture, and telephones. This type of pretend play encourages good social skills and a positive self-image.
Choose toys that are appropriate for the child’s age. They do not have to be expensive or complicated to be beneficial to the child. Common objects, such as pots and pans, empty boxes, spools of thread, shoelaces, and wooden spoons can stimulate activity. The best toys require active participation.
Remember when choosing a toy, to consider whether a child must be supervised while playing with it. Toys should not have small parts that break easily or that can be swallowed.
What can an occupational therapist do?
Evaluate a child’s motor (movement), cognitive (thinking, reasoning), social-emotional, and behavioral development.
Recommend toys and play activities that promote healthy development and provide stimulation to the child.
Intervene when needed to promote development and skills for living.
Advanced Therapy Care has been providing speech and occupational therapy services for children and adults for the past thirteen years.

  Louis Braille attended Haüy's school in 1819 and later taught there. He soon became determined to fashion a system of reading and writing that could bridge the critical gap in communication between the sighted and the blind. In his own words: "Access to communication in the widest sense is access to knowledge, and that is vitally important for us if we [the blind] are not to go on being despised or patronized by condescending sighted people. We do not need pity, nor do we need to be reminded we are vulnerable. We must be treated as equals – and communication is the way this can be brought about." In 1821, Braille learned of a communication system devised by Captain Charles Barbier of the French Army. Barbier's "night writing" was a code of dots and dashes impressed into thick paper. These impressions

 Scientists have known for years that when vampire bats tear through an animal’s skin with their razor-sharp teeth, their noses guide them to the best spots – where a precise bite will strike a vein and spill forth nourishing blood. But nobody knew exactly how bats knew where to bite.
By investigating wild vampire bats in South America, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco and Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Científicas in Caracas, Venezuela have discovered their secret: a sensitive, heat-detecting molecule covering nerve endings on their noses called TRPV1. A number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies are working on developing new pain medications that target molecules like TRPV1.
“Vampire bats feed on blood, and it’s useful for them to have an infrared detector to be able to find the circulation,” said David Julius, PhD, the Morris Herzstein Chair in Molecular Biology & Medicine at UCSF, who led the research.
Similar TRPV1 molecules can be found on pain sensing nerve fibers in human tongue, skin or eyes. They allow people to detect the chemical capsaicin in chili peppers and experience the burning tinge of spicy food.
Described this week in the journal Nature, the discovery highlights how small changes to genes in the genome of a species can contribute to major evolutionary adaptations over time – in this case, allowing the vampire bat to detect infrared heat from their prey, helping them efficiently find and feed on blood.
The work also adds a piece to a larger puzzle related to human health and drug design because these same molecules are involved in pain sensation, such as that associated with touching a hot object, or hypersensitivity to heat after injury and inflammation – as occurs with sunburn.
The human brain does not connect directly with the world but instead floats secluded in a protective bubble of cerebrospinal fluid within the skull. All the information the brain receives about Earthly sights, smells, textures, and tastes comes through long nerve fibers that make up the body’s sensory system, which connect the brain with our eyes, noses, fingers and tongues.
At the ends of these nerve fibers, cues that give life to our perception of the world are collected. Tiny molecular channels covering these nerve endings can alternatively open or close if they perceive the proper stimulus from a chemical, heat, cold or the pressure of touch. When they do, and when the right balance of openings and closings occurs all over a nerve ending, that nerve will fire, sending a signal to the brain that says “hot” or “cold” or “hard” or “bitter” or “pretty”? (something for taste and sight) depending on the type of stimulus.
This basic physiology informs our awareness and also warns our brains about noxious dangers of the world. Painful stimuli signal danger to the brain and cause us to wince, squint, gasp or otherwise pull away to protect ourselves.
“There is a lot of stuff in our environment that we want to stay away from,” Julius said.
TRPV1, one of these sensory system channels, does belong to a large family of similar molecules common to many types of animals but they differ slightly from animal to animal – both in terms of their DNA and in terms of where they appear in the body.
Subtle changes to these molecules contribute to highly specialized physiologies for sensing the world. Many animals have highly specialized adaptations allowing them to see, feel, hear or taste in special ways. The heat-sensing molecules within vampire bat noses is one example.
In appearance, the furry, bean-shaped bat with its rodent-like face resembles a rat with wings, but bats are actually more closely related in evolution to dogs and horses. In fact, vampire bats in the wild will gallop and leap across the ground much in the same way that horses do.
In South America where they are common, vampire bats approach their prey on the ground, galloping quickly and quietly as they sneak up on, bite, and drink the blood from sleeping cows, goats and birds.
Vampire bats are the only known mammal that survives solely on blood, and they need to drink it pretty much every day to survive. They support this need through a number of evolutionary adaptations.
Like other bats, they feed only at night, and they have excellent eyesight enhanced by acute hearing and an ability to emit high-pitched sounds that help them navigate. Their teeth lack enamel, which keeps them constantly razor sharp and allows them to delicately tear through the hide of a sleeping animal without waking it. Grooves in their tongue draw up the blood seeping through the open wound through capillary action, and they have anticoagulation chemicals inside their saliva to keep it flowing.
Within minutes of sinking its teeth in an animal’s flesh, an adult vampire bat can drink half its body weight in blood. But first they must find a vein, helped by its major adaptations: heat-sensing ability, which allows them to “see” a vein at night.
Researchers have known for years that pits on vampire bats’ noses allow them to detect blood vessels because they radiate heat. But no one knew exactly how this occurred.
Working with three researchers in South America, Julius’ postdoctoral fellows Elena Gracheva, PhD and Julio Cordero-Morales, PhD, together with UCSF colleagues Nicholas Ingolia, PhD and Jonathan Weissman, PhD, sequenced genes from samples of nose tissue from wild vampire bats in Venezuela, determining that TRPV1 is the molecule responsible for their ability to detect heat.
They also determined that it was not just TRPV1 but an evolutionary genetic variation of it that allows vampire bats to detect low temperature heat. Through a mechanism known as “alternative splicing” a special form of the molecule emerged in the noses of the bats, becoming a sensitive detector for finding the hottest spots.

 Visual – On a clear, dark night a candle can be seen from approximately 30 miles away. ; Olfactory – A person can smell a single drop of perfume after it has diffused into 3 rooms. ; Auditory – In a silent area, a person can hear a watch tick from approximately 20 feet. ; Vestibular – A person is able to tell of a tilt that when on a clock face is seen to be less than half a minute. ; Gustatory – A person can taste a single teaspoon of sugar which is diluted in 2 gallons of water. ; Tactile – A person can feel a fly's wing dropped from 3 feet above them falling onto their cheek. In 1962, Eugene Galanter, a psychologist, tested stimuli till people were able to feel them approximately 50% of the time, then used the following as examples of absolute threshold:  Through these conditions, Galanter was able to show that human's sensory organs are often more sensitive than originally thought.

These institutions provided simple vocational and adaptive training, as well as grounding in academic subjects offered through alternative formats. Literature, for example, was being made available to blind students by way of embossed Roman letters.

Blind children may also need special training in understanding spatial concepts, and in self-care, as they are often unable to learn visually and through imitation as other children do. Since only ten percent of those registered as legally blind have no usable vision, many students are also taught to use their remaining sight to maximum effect, so that some read print (with or without optical aids) and travel without canes. A combination of necessary training tailored to the unique needs of each student and solid academics goes a long way towards producing blind and visually impaired students capable of dealing with the world independently.

Many of the surface activities took longer than expected, so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted 34 minutes. Aldrin shoveled 6 kg of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly. Two types of rocks were found in the geological samples: basalt and breccia.

The true inclination of Upsilon Andromedae d was determined as 23.8° after combined results were measured from the Hubble Space Telescope and radial velocity measurements. When it was discovered, a limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae d is that the orbital inclination is unknown, and only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained, which was estimated to be about 4.1 times as massive as Jupiter. However, by combining radial velocity measurements from ground-based telescopes with astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers have determined the orbital inclination as well as the actual mass of the planet, which is about 10.25 times the mass of Jupiter.

The mission accomplished its goals but was marred by negative publicity the following year when it emerged that the crew had carried unauthorized postal covers to the lunar surface, some of which were sold by a West German stamp dealer. The members of the crew were reprimanded for poor judgment, and did not fly in space again. The mission also saw the collection of the Genesis Rock, thought to be part of the Moon's early crust, and Scott's use of a hammer and a feather to validate Galileo's theory that when there is no air resistance, objects fall at the same rate due to gravity regardless of their mass.

  The Earth, among other planets, orbits the Sun because the Sun exerts a gravitational pull that acts as a centripetal force, holding the Earth to it, which would otherwise go shooting off into space. If the Sun's pull is considered an action, then Earth simultaneously exerts a reaction as a gravitational pull on the Sun. Earth's pull has the same amplitude as the Sun but in the opposite direction. Since the Sun's mass is so much larger than Earth's, the Sun does not generally appear to react to the pull of Earth, but in fact it does, as demonstrated in the animation (not to precise scale). A correct way of describing the combined motion of both objects (ignoring all other celestial bodies for the moment) is to say that they both orbit around the center of mass, referred to in astronomy as the barycenter, of the combined system.

  of all forces. A possible cause of this problem is that the third law is often stated in an abbreviated form: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, without the details, namely that these forces act on two different objects. Moreover, there is a causal connection between the weight of something and the normal force: if an object had no weight, it would not experience support force from the table, and the weight dictates how strong the support force will be. This causal relationship is not due to the third law but to other physical relations in the system.

  of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground. All "coordinate accelerations" (or lack of them), are described by Newton's laws of motion as follows: The Second Law of Motion, the law of acceleration states that:, meaning that a force F acting on a body is equal to the mass m of the body times its acceleration a. The Third Law of Motion, the law of reciprocal actions states that: all forces occur in pairs, and these two forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Newton's third law of motion means that not only does

  As described by the third of Newton's laws of motion of classical mechanics, all forces occur in pairs such that if one object exerts a force on another object, then the second object exerts an equal and opposite reaction force on the first. The third law is also more generally stated as: "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts." The attribution of which of the two forces is the action and which is the reaction is arbitrary. Either of the two can be considered the action, while the other is its associated reaction.

  the same object, hence they are not action-reaction forces in the sense of Newton's third law. The actual action-reaction forces in the sense of Newton's third law are the book pushing down on the table and the book's upward gravitational force on the earth. Moreover, the forces acting on the book are not always equally strong; they will be different if the book is pushed down by a third force, or if the table is slanted, or if the table-and-book system is in an accelerating elevator. The case of any number of forces acting on the same object is covered by considering the

  equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object's mass. The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall. The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may

  One problem frequently observed by physics educators is that students tend to apply Newton's third law to pairs of 'equal and opposite' forces acting on the same object. This is incorrect; the third law refers to forces on two different objects. In contrast, a book lying on a table is subject to a downward gravitational force (exerted by the earth) and to an upward normal force by the table, both forces acting on the same book.

 If the force applied at the bracket is doubled, the moment would indeed double as well. Moment, also known as torque, is a measure of the rotational force exerted on an object around a certain point or axis. It depends on two factors: the force applied and the distance from the point of rotation.

In this case, if the force is doubled, it means that there is double the amount of force being applied to the bracket. As a result, the moment or rotational force experienced by the bracket would also double. This relationship is known as the direct proportionality between force and moment.

It's important to note that moment is influenced not only by the applied force but also by the distance from the point of rotation. If the force remains constant but the distance increases, the moment would also increase. Similarly, if the force remains constant but the distance decreases, the moment would decrease.

So, to summarize, if the force applied at the bracket is doubled, the moment would double as well. This relationship between force and moment is essential in understanding the rotational dynamics of objects.

  In physics, exertion is the expenditure of energy against, or inductive of, inertia as described by Isaac Newton's third law of motion. In physics, force exerted equivocates work done. The ability to do work can be either positive or negative depending on the direction of exertion relative to gravity. For example, a force exerted upwards, like lifting an object, creates positive work done on that object. Exertion often results in force generated, a contributing dynamic of general motion. In mechanics it describes the use of force against a body in the direction of its motion (see vector).

 The significance of the relative masses of bodies and the distance between them in determining the force of attraction is described by the law of universal gravitation. According to this law, the force of attraction between two bodies is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.

In other words, the larger the masses of the bodies, the greater the gravitational force of attraction between them. Similarly, as the distance between the bodies increases, the force of attraction decreases significantly.

For example, if you have two objects with equal masses, the force of attraction between them will be greater compared to two objects with unequal masses. Similarly, if the distance between two objects is halved, the force of attraction between them will quadruple.

This relationship between mass and distance is crucial in understanding the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies, such as planets, stars, and galaxies. It allows scientists to calculate and predict the movement and behavior of these celestial bodies in the universe.

Overall, the relative masses of bodies and the distance between them play a fundamental role in determining the force of attraction through the law of universal gravitation.

The third law is also more generally stated as: "To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary parts." The attribution of which of the two forces is the action and which is the reaction is arbitrary. Either of the two can be considered the action, while the other is its associated reaction.

Gravitational acceleration (except certain electromagnetic force influences) is the cause of an object's acceleration in relation to free fall. The g-force experienced by an object is due to the vector sum of all non-gravitational and non-electromagnetic forces acting on an object's freedom to move. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may

A possible cause of this problem is that the third law is often stated in an abbreviated form: For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, without the details, namely that these forces act on two different objects. Moreover, there is a causal connection between the weight of something and the normal force: if an object had no weight, it would not experience support force from the table, and the weight dictates how strong the support force will be. This causal relationship is not due to the third law but to other physical relations in the system.

  Respiration in cyanobacteria can occur in the thylakoid membrane alongside photosynthesis, with their photosynthetic electron transport sharing the same compartment as the components of respiratory electron transport. While the goal of photosynthesis is to store energy by building carbohydrates from CO2, respiration is the reverse of this, with carbohydrates turned back into CO2 accompanying energy release. Cyanobacteria appear to separate these two processes with their plasma membrane containing only components of the respiratory chain, while the thylakoid membrane hosts an interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chain. Cyanobacteria use electrons from succinate dehydrogenase rather than from NADPH for respiration. Cyanobacteria only respire during the night (or in the dark) because the facilities used for electron transport are used in reverse for photosynthesis while in the light.

These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net productivity. The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following: Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as, this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or "triose phosphates", namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is no direct reaction that converts to a sugar because all

Metabolic pathways responsible for photosynthesis are present in chloroplasts, whereas respiratory metabolic pathways are present in mitochondria. In these pathways, metabolic carriers (like phosphate) exchange NAD(P)H molecules between photosynthetic and respiratory ETCs. Evidence using mass spectrometry on algae and photosynthetic mutants of Chlamydomonas, discovered that oxygen molecules were also being exchanged between photosynthetic and chlororespiratory ETCs.

  These reactions are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced in photosystem I during the light dependent reactions.

In plant photosynthesis, water molecules are photo-oxidized to release oxygen and protons.

 Cells use a variety of fuel molecules in cellular respiration, including glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids. These molecules are oxidized to release energy that can be used by the cell. One common oxidizing agent in cellular respiration is molecular oxygen (O2). However, there are organisms that can respire using other organic molecules as electron acceptors instead of oxygen.

The energy released during cellular respiration is stored in "high-energy" carriers. One of the most important high-energy carriers is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP serves as a chemical storage of energy in cells and can be used for various cellular processes requiring energy. It acts as a universal energy currency because its presence indicates the availability of energy for energy-consuming processes.

ATP provides energy for various cellular processes by undergoing hydrolysis, which breaks it down into adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic phosphate (Pi), releasing energy in the process. This released energy can then be utilized by enzymes and other proteins to perform work within the cell. ATP plays a crucial role in biosynthesis, locomotion, transportation of molecules across cell membranes, and many other essential cellular processes.

In summary, cells utilize fuel molecules such as glucose, amino acids, and fatty acids in cellular respiration to obtain biochemical energy. The released energy is stored in high-energy carriers like ATP, which acts as a universal currency for providing energy to various cellular processes.

 Muscle fiber contraction results from a sliding movement of actin and myosin filaments that shortens the muscle fiber.
1. The Sliding Filament Theory a. The sarcomere, defined by striations, is the functional unit of skeletal muscle.
b. When thick and thin myofilaments slide past one another, the sarcomeres shorten. The muscle contracts.

b. The motor end plate of a muscle fiber lies on one side of a neuromuscular junction.
c. One motor neuron and the muscle fibers associated with it constitute a motor unit.
d. In response to a nerve impulse, the end of a motor nerve fiber secretes a neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the junction and stimulates the muscle fiber.
3. Stimulus for contraction a. Muscle fiber is usually stimulated by acetylcholine released from the end of a motor nerve fiber.
b. Acetylcholinesterase decomposes acetylcholine to prevent continuous stimulation.
c. Stimulation causes muscle fiber to conduct an impulse that travels over the surface of the sarcolemma and reaches the deep parts of the fiber by means of the transverse tubules.
4. Excitation contraction coupling a. A muscle impulse signals the sarcoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ions.
b. Linkages form between myosin and actin, and the actin filaments move inward, shortening the sarcomere.
a. A myosin cross-bridge can attach to an actin binding site and pull on the actin filament. The myosin head can then release the actin and combine with another active binding site farther down the actin filament, and pull again.
b. The breakdown of ATP releases energy that provides the repetition of the cross-bridge cycle.
6. Relaxation a. Acetylcholine remaining in the synapse is rapidly decomposed by acetylcholinesterase, preventing continuous stimulation of a muscle fiber.
b. The muscle fiber relaxes when calcium ions are transported back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
c. Cross-bridge linkages break and do not re-form—the muscle fiber relaxes.
7. Energy sources for contraction a. ATP supplies the energy for muscle fiber contraction.
b. Creatine phosphate stores energy that can be used to synthesize ATP as it is decomposed.
c. Active muscles depend upon cellular respiration for energy.
8. Oxygen supply and cellular respiration a. Anaerobic respiration yields few ATP molecules, whereas aerobic respiration provides many ATP molecules.
b. Hemoglobin in red blood cells carries oxygen from the lungs to body cells.
c. Myoglobin in muscle cells stores some oxygen temporarily.
9. Oxygen debt a. During rest or moderate exercise, oxygen is sufficient to support aerobic respiration.
b. During strenuous exercise, oxygen deficiency may develop, and lactic acid may accumulate as a result of anaerobic respiration.
c. The amount of oxygen needed to convert accumulated lactic acid to glucose and to restore supplies of ATP and creatine phosphate is called oxygen debt.
10. Muscle fatigue a. A fatigued muscle loses its ability to contract.
b. Muscle fatigue is usually due to the effects of accumulation of lactic acid.
c. Athletes usually produce less lactic acid than nonathletes because of their increased ability to supply oxygen and nutrients to muscles.

These reactions are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as the energy required to reduce the carbon dioxide is provided by NADPH produced in photosystem I during the light dependent reactions. Metabolic pathways responsible for photosynthesis are present in chloroplasts, whereas respiratory metabolic pathways are present in mitochondria. In these pathways, metabolic carriers (like phosphate) exchange NAD(P)H molecules between photosynthetic and respiratory ETCs. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Respiration in cyanobacteria can occur in the thylakoid membrane alongside photosynthesis, with their photosynthetic electron transport sharing the same compartment as the components of respiratory electron transport. While the goal of photosynthesis is to store energy by building carbohydrates from CO2, respiration is the reverse of this, with carbohydrates turned back into CO2 accompanying energy release. Cyanobacteria appear to separate these two processes with their plasma membrane containing only components of the respiratory chain, while the thylakoid membrane hosts an interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chain. Cyanobacteria use electrons from succinate dehydrogenase rather than from NADPH for respiration.

   The wind is caused by differences in atmospheric pressure which is mainly caused by temperature difference. When a difference in atmospheric pressure exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the Coriolis effect, except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the atmospheric circulation) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of solar energy leading to buoyancy forces) and the rotation of the planet. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach geostrophic balance. Near the Earth's surface, friction causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure

  Low-pressure weather systems with inward winds (such as a hurricane) spin counterclockwise north of the equator, but clockwise south of the equator. This is due to the Coriolis force, and requires that (assuming they are attached to each other and rotating in the same direction) the north and southern halves of Earth are angled in opposite directions (as in, the north is facing toward Polaris and the south is facing away from it).

  Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring

  Earth is massive enough that the pull of gravity maintains its roughly spherical shape. Most of its deviation from spherical stems from the centrifugal force caused by rotation around its north-south axis. This force deforms the sphere into an oblate ellipsoid.

  orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets. According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation

  is reversed. This obliquity causes Earth's seasons. The Moon's declination also changes, completing a cycle once every lunar nodal period: 27.212 days. Thus, lunar declination ranges from a positive value to a negative one in just under two weeks, and back. Consequently in under a month, the Moon's altitude at upper culmination (when it contacts the observer's meridian) can shift from higher in the sky to lower above the horizon, and back. The Moon differs from most natural satellites around other planets in that it remains near the ecliptic (the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun) instead of Earth's equatorial plane. The

  Wind is the natural movement of air or other gases relative to a planet's surface. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics and subtropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations.

  Newman's result represents the simplest stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat solution of Einstein's equations in the presence of an electromagnetic field in four dimensions. It is sometimes referred to as an "electrovacuum" solution of Einstein's equations. Any Kerr–Newman source has its rotation axis aligned with its magnetic axis. Thus, a Kerr–Newman source is different from commonly observed astronomical bodies, for which there is a substantial angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic moment. Specifically, neither the Sun, nor any of the planets in the Solar System have magnetic fields aligned with the spin axis. Thus, while the Kerr solution describes the gravitational field of the

  Sun's mass with an estimated age of 1.1 billion years. The star is radiating about 18 times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,533 K. It is this heat that gives it a yellow-white hue that is typical for an F-type star. Eta Scorpii is rotating rapidly, with a projected rotational velocity of 150 km s−1. This is causing the star to spin on its axis with a period of less than a day. It is an X-ray emitter with its stellar corona giving off an X-ray luminosity of 4.4 ergs s−1. In 1991 it was identified as a possible barium star, as it displays an enhanced abundance of the element barium in its spectrum. Overall, the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star's metallicity, is similar to the abundance in the Sun.

  Continents have a complex history and a great variety of rocks, sediments and soils; the climate on the surface, temperature profiles and hydrology also vary. Most of the information on subsurface life comes from a small number of sampling sites that are mainly in North America. With the exception of ice cores, densities of cells decline steeply with depth, decreasing by several orders of magnitude. In the top one or two meters of soils, organisms depend on oxygen and are heterotrophs, depending on the breakdown of organic carbon for their nutrition, and their decline in density parallels that of the organic material. Below that, there is no correlation, although both cell density and organic content declines by a further five orders

   Roughly 97% of the planet's water is in its oceans, and the oceans are the source of the vast majority of water vapor that condenses in the atmosphere and falls as rain or snow on the continents. The tremendous heat capacity of the oceans moderates the planet's climate, and its absorption of various gases affects the composition of the atmosphere. The ocean's influence extends even to the composition of volcanic rocks through seafloor metamorphism, as well as to that of volcanic gases and magmas created at subduction zones. From sea level, the oceans are far deeper than the continents are tall; examination of the Earth's hypsographic curve shows that the average elevation of Earth's landmasses is only 840 m, while the ocean's average depth is 3800 m. Though this apparent discrepancy is great, for both land and sea, the respective extremes such as mountains and trenches are rare.

  Rare Earth proponents argue that plate tectonics and a strong magnetic field are essential for biodiversity, global temperature regulation, and the carbon cycle. The lack of mountain chains elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life. Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from radioactive decay. Continents must be made of less dense felsic rocks that "float" on underlying denser mafic rock. Taylor emphasizes that tectonic subduction zones require the lubrication of oceans of water.

  The Earth contains approximately 1.33 atoms. Although small numbers of independent atoms of noble gases exist, such as argon, neon, and helium, 99% of the atmosphere is bound in the form of molecules, including carbon dioxide and diatomic oxygen and nitrogen. At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including water, salt, silicates and oxides. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals. This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.

 The dermis is composed of several components, including connective tissue, nerve endings, blood and lymphatic vessels, and adnexal structures such as hair shafts, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. It provides structural support to the skin and houses important structures like blood vessels and nerves. The dermis also plays a crucial role in regulating body temperature and providing sensation to touch, pain, and pressure (Reference text: D. Dermis consists of connective tissue, nerve endings, blood and lymphatic vessels, and adnexal structures).

On the other hand, the epidermis is a layer of the skin that acts as a barrier against environmental insults and fluid loss. It is made up of keratinocytes and is divided into four layers. The epidermis is responsible for protecting the body from harmful substances, preventing excessive water loss, and providing a physical barrier to pathogens. It also participates in the production of vitamin D when exposed to sunlight (Reference text: C. Epidermis is comprised of keratinocytes and has four layers. Functions as a barrier against environmental insults and fluid loss).

  Biogeology is the study of the interactions between the Earth's biosphere and the lithosphere. Biogeology examines biotic, hydrologic, and terrestrial systems in relation to each other, to help understand the Earth's climate, oceans, and other effects on geologic systems. For example, bacteria are responsible for the formation of some minerals such as pyrite, and can concentrate economically important metals such as tin and uranium. Bacteria are also responsible for the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which affects weathering rates of rocks. Prior to the late Devonian period, there was little plant life beyond lichens, and bryophytes. At this time large vascular plants evolved, growing up to 30 m in height. These large plants changed the atmosphere, and altered the composition of the soil by increasing the amount of organic carbon. This helped prevent the soil being washed away through erosion.

 Typically, cells of the two superficial-most layers contain abundant glycogen as a result of differentiation.The stratified, nonkeratinized squamous epithelium lining the vagina (and portio vaginalis cervicis) is composed of up to 20 layers of cells and is made up of four tiers: strata basale, parabasale, intermedium, and superficiale.It commences distal to the isthmus of the uterus as the portio supravaginalis cervicis, which is the upper part of the cervix surrounded by connective tissue of the parametrium, and ends at its lower portion that extends into the vagina (portio vaginalis cervicis). At the level of the portio supravaginalis cervicis the uterus is held in place by ligaments (mainly the lig. cardinalis, cf. p. 388). The tubular lumen of the cervix is called the canalis cervicis uteri. It is lined with tunica mucosa and begins at the ostium uteri internum and ends with the ostium uteri at the portio vaginalis of the cervix. The mucosal epithelium of the canalis cervicis uteri is composed of a single layer of mucus-secreting columnar epithelium. A parallel arrangement of folds (plicae palmatae), which form crypts, gives the epithelium a rough appearance on the surface. The function of the reserve cells located at the base of the epithelium is to replenish the cervical epithelium. Unlike the one-layered cervical epithelium, the vagina is lined with stratified, non-keratinized squamous epithelium, which depending on the hormonal situation in women may continue to the surface of the portio vaginalis of the cervix. The boundaries of the two epithelial layers can be either endo- or ectocervical (see **C** ). The stratified, nonkeratinized squamous epithelium lining the vagina (and portio vaginalis cervicis) is composed of up to 20 layers of cells and is made up of four tiers: strata basale, parabasale, intermedium, and superficiale. Typically, cells of the two superficial-most layers contain abundant glycogen as a result of differentiation.Glycogen that is released as a result nourishes lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, Döderlein's bacillus), which inhabit the vagina.The transformation of glycogen into lactic acid leads to the acidic vaginal milieu (pH 4–5), which mainly in the second half of the menstrual cycle protects against pathogens (see **B** ).

 Actin cytoskeleton demonstration in Trichomonas vaginalis and in other trichomonads.
The flagellate form of Trichomonas vaginalis (T v) transforms to amoeboid cells upon adherence to converslips. They grow and their nuclei divide without undergoing cytokinesis, yielding giant cells and a monolayer of T v F-actin was demonstrated in Trichomonas vaginalis by fluorescence microscopy using phalloidin and an anti-actin mAb which labelled the cytoplasm of both the flagellate and amoeboid forms. Comparative electrophoresis and immunoblotting established that the actin band has the same 42 kDa as muscle actin, but 2-D electrophoresis resolved the actin band into four spots; the two major spots observed were superimposable with major muscle actin isoforms. Electron microscopy demonstrated an ectoplasmic microfibrillar layer along the adhesion zone of amoeboid T v adhering to coverslips. Immunogold staining, using anti-actin monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that this layer was mainly composed of actin microfilaments. A comparative immunoblotting study comprising seven trichomonad species showed that all trichomonads studied expressed actin. The mAb Sigma A-4700 specific for an epitope on the actin C-terminal sequence labelled only actin of Trichomonas vaginalis, Tetratrichomonas gallinarum. Trichomitus batrachorum and Hypotrichomonas acosta, but not the actin of Tritrichomonas foetus, Tritrichomonas augusta and Monocercomonas sp. This discrimination between a 'trichomonas branch' and a 'tritrichomonas branch' is congruent with inferred sequence phylogeny from SSu rRNA and with classical phylogeny of trichomonads.

At the surface of the Earth, an overwhelming majority of atoms combine to form various compounds, including water, salt, silicates and oxides. Atoms can also combine to create materials that do not consist of discrete molecules, including crystals and liquid or solid metals. This atomic matter forms networked arrangements that lack the particular type of small-scale interrupted order associated with molecular matter.
 3 -0.51634  Rare Earth proponents argue that plate tectonics and a strong magnetic field are essential for biodiversity, global temperature regulation, and the carbon cycle. The lack of mountain chains elsewhere in the Solar System is direct evidence that Earth is the only body with plate tectonics, and thus the only nearby body capable of supporting life. Plate tectonics depend on the right chemical composition and a long-lasting source of heat from radioactive decay. Continents must be made of less dense felsic rocks that "float" on underlying denser mafic rock. Taylor emphasizes that tectonic subduction zones require the lubrication of oceans of water. 
 4 -0.56148  Continents have a complex history and a great variety of rocks, sediments and soils; the climate on the surface, temperature profiles and hydrology also vary. Most of the information on subsurface life comes from a small number of sampling sites that are mainly in North America. With the exception of ice cores, densities of cells decline steeply with depth, decreasing by several orders of magnitude. In the top one or two meters of soils, organisms depend on oxygen and are heterotrophs, depending on the breakdown of organic carbon for their nutrition, and their decline in density parallels that of the organic material. Below that, there is no correlation, although both cell density and organic content declines by a further five orders 
 5 -0.67984  Biogeology is the study of the interactions between the Earth's biosphere and the lithosphere. Biogeology examines biotic, hydrologic, and terrestrial systems in relation to each other, to help understand the Earth's climate, oceans, and other effects on geologic systems. For example, bacteria are responsible for the formation of some minerals such as pyrite, and can concentrate economically important metals such as tin and uranium. Bacteria are also responsible for the chemical composition of the atmosphere, which affects weathering rates of rocks. Prior to the late Devonian period, there was little plant life beyond lichens, and bryophytes. At this time large vascular plants evolved, growing up to 30 m in height. These large plants changed the atmosphere, and altered the composition of the soil by increasing the amount of organic carbon. This helped prevent the soil being washed away through erosion.

  waters. There are four major routes through which pesticides reach the water: it may drift outside of the intended area when it is sprayed, it may percolate, or leach through the soil, it may be carried to the water as runoff, or it may be spilled, for example accidentally or through neglect. They may also be carried to water by eroding soil. Factors that affect a pesticide's ability to contaminate water include its water solubility, the distance from an application site to a body of water, weather, soil type, presence of a growing crop, and the method used to apply the chemical.

   Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths. Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide. An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The Push–pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).

  A pesticide is a substance or a mixture of substances used for killing pests: organisms dangerous to cultivated plants or to animals. The term applies to various pesticides such as insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and nematocide. Applications of pesticides to crops and animals may leave residues in or on food when it is consumed, and those specified derivatives are considered to be of toxicological significance.

  Pesticide residue refers to the pesticides that may remain on or in food after they are applied to food crops. The maximum allowable levels of these residues in foods are often stipulated by regulatory bodies in many countries. Regulations such as pre-harvest intervals also often prevent harvest of crop or livestock products if recently treated in order to allow residue concentrations to decrease over time to safe levels before harvest. Exposure of the general population to these residues most commonly occurs through consumption of treated food sources, or being in close contact to areas treated with pesticides such as farms or lawns. Many of these chemical residues, especially derivatives of chlorinated pesticides, exhibit bioaccumulation which could build up to harmful levels in the body as well as in the environment. Persistent chemicals can be magnified through the food chain and have been detected in products ranging from meat, poultry, and fish, to vegetable oils, nuts, and various fruits and vegetables.

   Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers. Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects. As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families

  Many kinds of animals are harmed by pesticides, leading many countries to regulate pesticide usage through Biodiversity Action Plans. Animals including humans may be poisoned by pesticide residues that remain on food, for example when wild animals enter sprayed fields or nearby areas shortly after spraying. Pesticides can eliminate some animals' essential food sources, causing the animals to relocate, change their diet or starve. Residues can travel up the food chain; for example, birds can be harmed when they eat insects and worms that have consumed pesticides. Earthworms digest organic matter and increase nutrient content in the top layer of soil. They protect human health by ingesting decomposing litter and serving as bioindicators of soil activity. Pesticides have had harmful effects on growth and reproduction on earthworms. Some pesticides can bioaccumulate, or build up to toxic levels in the bodies of organisms that consume them over time, a phenomenon that impacts species high on the food chain especially hard.

 Plants, on the other hand, are relatively less contaminated, usually only by what's been sprayed on them.Animal products, high on the food chain, are laden with pesticides from the foods the animals consume, as well as antibiotics and various hormones.As a solution, he recommends the general principle of eating food as low on the food chain as possible.The Dietary Guidelines for Americans (jointly issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services) puts at the top of its dietary recommendations the suggestion that one "eat a variety of foods" in order to get the widest variety of nutrients. ## Toxins in the Food Chain

One of the greatest long-term problems that health-conscious individuals face is the pervasive contamination of America's food supply. For decades, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other government agencies have allowed the multibillion-dollar food industry to grow and process its products with hundreds of questionably safe chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, dyes, stabilizers, and preservatives, as well as antibiotics, hormones, and other drugs given to animals. The long-term consequences of ingesting these chemicals are still not well understood. Many experts now believe that lifetime ingestion of these chemicals can play a major role in causing cancer, neurotoxicity (destruction of nerve tissue by toxic substances), birth defects, decreased immune function, food allergies, and chemical sensitivity. See Environmental Medicine. In his book Diet for a Poisoned Planet, David Steinman, former representative of the public interest at the National Academy of Sciences, makes an exhaustive study of chemical residues in the food chain. As a solution, he recommends the general principle of eating food as low on the food chain as possible. Animal products, high on the food chain, are laden with pesticides from the foods the animals consume, as well as antibiotics and various hormones. Plants, on the other hand, are relatively less contaminated, usually only by what's been sprayed on them.### Pesticides

Over 400 pesticides are currently licensed for use on America's foods and, every year, over 2.5 billion pounds are dumped on croplands, forests, lawns, and fields.A person can get several types of pesticides with a salad, different ones in meat or fish, still others in the vegetables on the side, and a separate dose with dessert.

 Paraquat is the most important agent of this class (Figure 56–1).Some of the toxic effects are related to the surfactant material.Although glyphosate seems to have little persistence and lower toxicity than other herbicides, the commercial formulations often contain surfactants and other active compounds that complicate the toxicity of the product.Almost all soybean crops and many corn crops grown today are of the glyphosate-resistant type. These genetically modified (GMO) crops are grown from patented seeds and have great economic value to growers, contributing to the food supply in a meaningful way. However, in some jurisdictions their use is highly controversial. While there is no evidence that the modified crops are toxic or dangerous to humans or animals, the long-term agricultural impact of widespread use of glyphosate herbicides on resistant crops remains to be determined. Additionally, the impact of effective weed elimination on the food supply and habitat of critical insect species, eg, bees, and some migrating birds has been a source of increasing concern. Because of the widespread availability and use of this herbicide, glyphosate-surfactant poisonings are common. Many of the observed ingestions and reports of poisoning are from developing countries, where suicide by pesticide is common. Many injuries are minor, but some serious and lethal poisonings have been reported. Glyphosate is a significant eye and skin irritant. When ingested it can cause mild to moderate esophageal erosion. It also causes aspiration pneumonia and renal failure. There have been some reports of teratogenic outcomes in workers who handle and apply glyphosate, but the epidemiologic evidence is not clear. There is a growing literature on management of acute glyphosate poisoning. Treatment is symptomatic and no specific protocol is indicated. Hemodialysis has been used with success in cases of renal failure. Although glyphosate seems to have little persistence and lower toxicity than other herbicides, the commercial formulations often contain surfactants and other active compounds that complicate the toxicity of the product. Some of the toxic effects are related to the surfactant material. Paraquat is the most important agent of this class (Figure 56–1).Ingestion (accidental or suicidal) is among the most serious and potentially lethal pesticide poisonings.Many serious exposures take place in developing countries where limited treatment resources are available.Paraquat accumulates slowly in the lung by an active process and causes lung edema, alveolitis, and progressive fibrosis.

 It is well known that chronic effects may be observed as the result of repeated ingestion of a number of small doses, each in itself insufficient to cause an immediate acute reaction but in the long term having a cumulative toxic effect."The absence of acute poisonings with fatal outcome does not prove the safety of synthetic packaging materials....Methyl bromide is a gas pesticide still used on tomatoes, strawberries, and other crops in the United States despite the U.S. government's having signed an international treaty banning most uses of the fumigant by 2005. The chemical harms the human neurological system. Growers of the affected crops complain that no effective and cheap replacement has been found for methyl bromide, so they have used their political influence to convince agencies of the U.S. government to grant them exemptions. Even golf courses have won this exemption (from Associated Press, "Despite treaty ban, U.S. farmers continue to use pesticide," November 27, 2005). * Until 2002, plastics used to package foods were called "indirect food additives" by the FDA because it is generally understood that plastics leach chemicals into food, water, and the human body. But in that year the FDA changed the terminology to "food contact substances" so the public would not be unduly alarmed by the migration of plastics into food and water, especially bisphenol A (BPA) found in plastic water bottles. BPA is a well-known endocrine disrupter affecting development, memory, intelligence, and learning. But duly alarmed is probably what we should be, if we listen to Victor O. Sheftel, chief environmental toxicologist at the Ministry of Health in Israel. He points out that the plastic called polymeric materials (PM) is used to package nearly 80 percent of our food. "The absence of acute poisonings with fatal outcome does not prove the safety of synthetic packaging materials.... It is well known that chronic effects may be observed as the result of repeated ingestion of a number of small doses, each in itself insufficient to cause an immediate acute reaction but in the long term having a cumulative toxic effect.* Of 9,282 people nationwide tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 93 percent were found to have the insecticide TCP in their bodies and 99 percent carried a breakdown product of DDT.More than half of the test subjects had a dozen or more pesticides on average in their blood and urine.Much of this body burden had been absorbed through the foods they consumed.

  People can be exposed to pesticides by a number of different routes including: occupation, in the home, at school and in their food. There are concerns that pesticides used to control pests on food crops are dangerous to people who consume those foods. These concerns are one reason for the organic food movement. Many food crops, including fruits and vegetables, contain pesticide residues after being washed or peeled. Chemicals that are no longer used but that are resistant to breakdown for long periods may remain in soil and water and thus in food. The United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission has recommended international standards for maximum residue limits (MRLs), for individual pesticides in food. In the EU, MRLs are set by DG-SANCO. In the United States, levels of residues that

 3 -0.15501  A pesticide is a substance or a mixture of substances used for killing pests: organisms dangerous to cultivated plants or to animals. The term applies to various pesticides such as insecticide, fungicide, herbicide and nematocide. Applications of pesticides to crops and animals may leave residues in or on food when it is consumed, and those specified derivatives are considered to be of toxicological significance.
 4 -0.17759   Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant. The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths. Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the "pesticide treadmill" in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide. An alternative argument is that the way to "save the environment" and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'. However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable, and that pesticides simply replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation. The Push–pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).
 5 -0.20493  People can be exposed to pesticides by a number of different routes including: occupation, in the home, at school and in their food. There are concerns that pesticides used to control pests on food crops are dangerous to people who consume those foods. These concerns are one reason for the organic food movement. Many food crops, including fruits and vegetables, contain pesticide residues after being washed or peeled. Chemicals that are no longer used but that are resistant to breakdown for long periods may remain in soil and water and thus in food. The United Nations Codex Alimentarius Commission has recommended international standards for maximum residue limits (MRLs), for individual pesticides in food. In the EU, MRLs are set by DG-SANCO. In the United States, levels of residues that

  While workers cannot produce other workers or queens, the unfertilized eggs that they lay can become males. At around the same time that the queen begins to lay eggs that will develop into males, the workers' ovaries, those "house bees" who stay in the nest, begin to develop. As workers try to lay eggs of their own, there is increased aggression among workers and among workers and queens. These workers may even try to eat the eggs laid by the queen and if they are persistent enough, will be successful in laying eggs of their own.

  large eggs are said to measure over 70 mm high. The weight of eggs is reported 75 to 100 g, averaging some 87 g. The eggs in a multiple egg clutch are laid at about 3 or 4 day intervals, with the incubation beginning with the first egg laying. The incubation stage lasts for 42-44. The female does most of the incubation, relieved only for short spells by males who usually bring prey for her. Male incubation can be as long as an hour but usually much shorter. Over 28 hours of observation over 9 days at 2 nests, the females of the two pairs incubated a mean of 82.6% of the time to the males’ 7.1%, while the remainder no incubation. Green leaves are still added by both members of the pair during incubation.

Most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation. Caecilians, some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented. In the wood frog (Rana sylvatica), the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to 6 C-change warmer than its surroundings, which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat. The eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups, or may take the form of spherical egg masses, rafts or long strings. In terrestrial caecilians, the eggs are

  In fact, the balancing of most eggs on their broad ends is not particularly difficult at any time of the year. No physical influence of other celestial bodies on the egg can affect its balance to the extent required by the folk belief. Gravitational and electromagnetic forces, in particular, are considerably weaker and steadier than the disturbances created by the person's breathing and heartbeat. In 1947, after Japanese newspapers picked up the story, the physicist Ukichiro Nakaya verified experimentally that eggs in fact can be balanced with ease at any time of the year. He noticed that the shell of an egg usually has many small bumps and dimples so that, by turning the egg in

  Adults feed on many things including decaying matter, excreta, and flowers. This insect normally reproduces within carcasses of dead animals, leaving eggs inside, usually together eggs of other species. Thus, although the first larvae feed on nutrients of decomposing tissues, the second and third series of larvae become predators, feeding on larvae of different species and even practicing cannibalism. Although eggs are normally deposited in decomposing tissues, they may, however, also be found in wounds of living tissues, both in animals and in humans. The ideal heat range for egg laying is 25° to 27°o C. The duration of the larval stage may differ as a result of temperature. This species plays also a significant role as a voracious predator of other dipteran larvae during the maggot stage. At temperatures between 20 and 30 °C the life cycle of Chrysomya albiceps from egg to adult lasts about 66 days.

  Although they are smaller and have fewer ovarioles than queens, workers retain the ability to lay viable eggs. This ability is somewhat limited. Workers which are in close proximity to the queen often lay trophic or sterile eggs presumably due to hormone signals from the queen. In addition, the queen caste routinely consumes eggs laid by workers.

Despite the long exposure to degradation under oxic conditions during transport in the water column, and substantially lower concentration of organic matter on the seafloor, there is evidence that planktonic eDNA is preserved in marine sediments and contains exploitable ecological signal.

  decline with depth. Sediments form layers with different conditions for life. In the top 5–10 centimeters, animals burrow, reworking the sediment and extending the sediment-water interface. The water carries oxygen, fresh organic matter and dissolved metabolites, resulting in a heterogenous environment with abundant nutrients. Below the burrowed layer is a layer dominated by sulfate reduction. Below that, the anaerobic reduction of methane is facilitated by sulfate in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ). Once the sulfates are depleted, methane formation takes over. The depth of the chemical zones depends on the rate that organic matter is deposited. Where it is rapid, oxygen is taken up rapidly as organic matter is consumed;

"The Web site represents a quasi-organized list of everything that I wish I knew off the top of my head, but don't," he says.
Abedon, who teaches medical microbiology, explains several principles healthcare workers (HCWs) should know about cleaning and disinfecting.
"To kill, a disinfectant must both penetrate and then destroy some aspect of a microorganism," he says. "It is easy to produce highly penetrating and deadly disinfectants. The problem, however, is one of handling those disinfectants. For instance, nuclear weapons probably do a wonderful job of killing off local microbial life, but hardly would qualify as a relatively innocuous disinfection procedure.
"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant to disinfectants particularly because the waxy outer coating of mycobacteria prevents the penetration of various chemical antibacterials. The extra-slow growth rates of these bacteria may also give rise to their reduced susceptibility since disinfectants typically are more effective against actively growing bacteria than against not-growing bacteria. So, disinfectants tend to lack an ability to destroy everything (including all living things) in their vicinity, which is good because we often are in their vicinity, but also is bad because it limits their ability to kill the very organisms that you would hope they would kill."
And the details surrounding that million-dollar question?
"Endospores are notoriously resistant to desiccation (drying out), as are mycobacteria," he says. "So in the question that leaves the E. coli. It turns out that bacteria can be more stable suspended within organic-rich environments, such as pus. Note, however, that it once was a perfectly legitimate means of storage of at least some bacterial strains to simply place them in distilled water and then hold them there at room temperature."
Abedon, who has a penchant for all things tie-died, has comical, yet practical advice for those cleaning and disinfecting medical instruments.
"Wear gloves to protect yourself, keep your hands away from your face and also avoid using chemical disinfectants except in reasonably well-ventilated environments," he says. "In other words, take care of yourselves. Oh yes, and don't forget to read the directions on the disinfectant bottle."
And yes, that is his final answer.

  for example. Hypocausts were pre-adapted to burn poor quality fuels like straw as well as coal. There is a good reason to believe that both straw and coal were important fuels in antiquity, especially in Roman Britain where coal was abundant in many areas. A great deal of protection against soil erosion arises from terracing hillsides. We do not know how extensive terraces were in antiquity but a good deal of the soil erosion here assumed to be caused by the Romans, may well date to the Dark Ages when the maintenance of terraces broke down. Changes in tree cover may well arise

Wind powers the voyages of sailing ships across Earth's oceans. Hot air balloons use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of wind shear caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.

  coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can prevail. Winds are commonly classified by their spatial scale, their speed and direction, the forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. Winds have various aspects: velocity (wind speed); the density of the gas involved; energy content or wind energy. The wind is also a critical means of transportation for seeds, insects, and birds, which can travel on wind currents for thousands of miles. In meteorology, winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the

   The ancient Sinhalese of Anuradhapura and in other cities around Sri Lanka used the monsoon winds to power furnaces as early as 300 BCE. The furnaces were constructed on the path of the monsoon winds to bring the temperatures inside up to 1200 C. A rudimentary windmill was used to power an organ in the first century CE. Windmills were later built in Sistan, Afghanistan, from the 7th century CE. These were vertical-axle windmills, with sails covered in reed matting or cloth material. These windmills were used to grind corn and draw up water, and were used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries. Horizontal-axle windmills were later used extensively

 A molecular biologist and entrepreneur sees green as the next wave of the genomic revolution.
When most people think of the Human Genome Project — the scientific research that produced the first map of the genetic makeup of the human species — they think of it as a new knowledge base with the potential to transform modern medicine. And indeed, since the 1990s, the field of human genomics has helped biotechnology researchers identify life-threatening diseases, slow the aging process, and create more effective drugs. It is even possible today to construct human organs biologically to replace damaged ones. These organs are not artificial; they are made of a person’s own cells. The implications for human health and well-being are immense. But what if the benefits of genomic research turned out to be much broader, with equally immense implications for the global economy and our natural environment?
Making that sweeping proposition seem credible has been a recent mission for William A. Haseltine, president and founder of the William A. Haseltine Foundation for Medical Sciences and the Arts. Haseltine has been at the vanguard of discoveries in molecular biology and the commercialization of bio­technologies for more than three decades — as a medical school professor, entrepreneur, and health-care philanthropist.
In 1992, Haseltine founded Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI), one of the first biopharmaceutical companies to patent human genomic sequences for medical use. He coined the term regenerative medicine to describe the use of natural human substances, such as genes, proteins, and stem cells, to regenerate diseased or damaged human tissue. As a professor at Harvard Medical School from 1976 to 1993, he was part of a team at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute that led the race to discover how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) compromises, and ultimately destroys, the human immune system. His laboratory determined the genomic sequence of HIV, and Haseltine developed many of the tools that have led to successful combination chemotherapy for the treatment of AIDS.
After retiring as CEO of HGSI in 2004, Haseltine focused his attention further on developing life-saving drugs and medical devices and making them accessible. Al­though he still believes genomics holds great promise for medicine, he questions the market potential of presymptomatic genetic testing and acknowledges that the commercialization of drugs has been more difficult than was expected. At the same time, Haseltine is a passionate advocate of “green” genomics. He foresees new applications of “synthetic biology” for healing the earth, for example, by using gene splicing and microbial cultivation in seawater to create a carbon-neutral source of energy from sunlight.
In October 2008, strategy+business sat down with Haseltine at the dining room table in his 86th-floor New York City apartment. Surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, with views both of Manhattan’s dense material labyrinth and the faraway Catskill Mountain greenery, we spoke of the changes that biotechnology will bring — and the uncertainties of our political, cultural, economic, and uniquely human responses.
S+B: Where are the most important advances in genomics emerging?
HASELTINE: The major benefit of genomic science thus far has been for humans. But in the long run, it is not just for humans. It is of humans. Through the genomic revolution we are opening up all the genomes of life for our perusal, and few people have thought through the implications.
Medicine will still be important going forward; every week brings a few new genomes into our knowledge banks. But I don’t think medical applications will be the major use for investment dollars. The next revolution is going to be about en­ergy, agriculture, and materials science. That, I think, is going to surprise people. Most of life on Earth is invisible. From the bottom of the sea at the hot sea vents, to the dirt under our city streets, there’s an enormous range of microorganisms that play fundamental roles in shaping the course of life everywhere. Now, genetic science allows re­searchers to intervene at that level.
If you think about the future of biotechnology, what’s old is becoming new again.
S+B: What do you mean by that?
HASELTINE: Biotechnology literally means technology applied to manipulate the living world. Humans have been at this a very long time. It’s one of the oldest technologies, and its greatest successes have been in agriculture, animal husbandry, and fermentation.
Now we are back in the same arenas, with a new set of emerging technologies. To give you an idea of the excitement around the use of biotechnology for energy: The Berkeley Center for Synthetic Biology received about US$1 billion in grants in 2007. I’m the chairman of the board of trustees of this group. It was founded and is directed by Jay Keasling, a professor of bio- and chemical engineering at Berkeley and the director of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s Physical Biosciences Division. About half the energy research money came from BP and the other half came from federal grants. This is only the be­ginning. Biotechnology will be the basis for a whole new petro­leum-free carbon-based economy.
S+B: How would synthetic biology produce energy on a mass scale?
HASELTINE: Synthetic biology is not a name I like. I prefer to call this new discipline constructive biology, because this form of biology constructs new molecules.
But to answer your question: Plants have been fixing carbon from the atmosphere with the energy of sunlight, and converting it to fossil fuel, over the course of several hundred million years. This means that living systems have the power, of course, to make our fuel. The trick is to do it much, much faster.
We already know how to effectively create biomass from plants. We grow forests for wood; we have agriculture. With a combination of modern biotechnology techniques we could remove carbon from the air, turn it into a fuel, use that fuel, and return the carbon to the at­mosphere so the whole process is carbon-­neutral with respect to the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Essentially, these techniques would allow us to farm en­ergy, coupling the photosynthetic process with biochemical production of useful hydrocarbons.
Let me take you back in time to think about that for a minute. Before there was life on Earth, it was basically a wet, hot rock. When it cooled down, it was a rock with water. Living organisms arose (we’re not quite sure how), and over the course of several billion years, they transformed rock and water into this beautiful Earth. That’s enormous chemical power, and all of it is locked up in the genes of organisms that proliferate all over the world.
Now that we can directly read genomes, store them in computers, and analyze them, and splice genes from one organism to another, we can move hydrocarbons through almost any chemical pathway we want. Suppose you wanted to take yeast that normally makes ethanol and convert it to yeast that makes diesel fuel. You would write up the chemical path to show the normal process to ethanol, and then reroute the path to diesel fuel. In modern organic chemistry, that would involve a series of eight or nine steps in a test tube using various catalysts. But now you can use genome database analysis to identify and isolate enzymes that can provide that pathway naturally. You can then modify those enzymes so they’re more efficient. This is an example of constructive biology.
We know constructive biology works because these were the methods used to produce the antimalarial drug artemisinin in both bacteria and yeast. Plants use a very complicated and expensive process to make artemisinin. At the Center for Synthetic Biology, a project led by Jay Keasling (and funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) re-created the entire pathway both in bacteria and in yeast. That breakthrough, which makes artemisinin cheaper to produce and therefore affordable to the world’s poorest children, has made Keasling a leader in the field of constructive biology.
S+B: You mentioned energy farming. What does that look like?
HASELTINE: Many microorganisms grow in the sea, and there are a number of potential ways to use them for energy production. One is to place algae tanks far below the surface, but not so deep that they can’t get sunlight piped down to them. Another is to create a series of saltwater-filled tubes on the surface of a large desert and place algae so that sunlight is absorbed as you pump the water through. There are a number of places in the world where huge deserts are right next to the sea. You don’t want to use arable land, and this gets us away from freshwater, too.
These farms could create a continual atmospheric carbon-neutral production cycle: algae taking sunlight, fixing carbon, and producing useful fuels. As I said earlier, what is old is new again. Humanity used to burn wood for energy. Less than 200 years ago, we started burning fossil fuels. Now we’re returning to the older process, but it’s more efficient with the modern advances of genomics, gene regulation, gene splicing, microbial cultivation, and massive ocean engineering.
S+B: Doesn’t that suggest a reorientation for the energy industry?
HASELTINE: Some oil companies are already calling themselves energy companies. In the future, energy companies will be diversified. They will primarily use solar and wind energy to produce electricity and fuel; they will also provide some fossil fuel energy and atomic energy. The materials sector is also very important; it will be the next focus of synthetic biology and of chemistry. All the chemical companies are very interested in petroleum substitution and micro-materials, and the life sciences have enormous amounts to contribute to material manufacturing as well.
S+B: How will basic industrial manufacturing processes be changed?
HASELTINE: New manufacturing processes will not use the vats typical of a chemical plant. Instead, the manufacturing basis for materials will be microbial. Life sciences teach us that if you have one good organic substance, it can reproduce itself endlessly and reproduce those products. All you have to do is keep feeding it. You don’t have to keep making it again and again and again. We already know how to produce plastic precursors with yeast and bacteria or plants. So we can grow these materials as we manufacture them.
S+B: What is the connection be­tween nanotechnology and biotechnology?
HASELTINE: The fundamental architecture of matter is an atom and a molecule. Something as large as a forest is made of very tiny substances, hooked together. Life and materials sciences are teaching us that we can arrange atoms in precise locations, to self-assemble and form units in small to very large sizes — replicating the manufacturing pro­cesses of nature. The fact that forests grow and that bacteria proliferate shows you that nano-machines work, and can be very efficient. We can build materials that self-assemble, and this means we can reduce the amount of material used in our lives. For example, we don’t have to carve objects out of great masses of metal (and discard the waste), because we can have them assembled, at the molecular or multimolecular level, with every molecule used. Eventually we can make them intelligent so they’ll assemble on command. The basic unit would be a very tiny, submicroscopic unit embodied with the information that says, “connect A, B, C, D.” It will then, in effect, construct itself: We can make a chair, we can make a table, and we can build a house.
This type of construction will probably not be available until the end of this century or the beginning of the next century. Think of it as an intelligent Lego set that you could program so the pieces compose themselves. You could then create a program that says, “Make a candlestick, make a chair, and make a wall.” Ray Kurzweil describes these types of technologies in his book The Age of Intelligent Machines (MIT Press, 1992).
S+B: What are the implications for food production?
HASELTINE: Earth’s population is projected to rise to almost 10 billion by 2050. So the need for freshwater and land is acute; we must use our agricultural land more intensively. Genetically modified organisms can help with that. They can produce higher yields and more nutritious foods. They can obviate the need for plowing. Most people don’t understand what plowing is for. It’s really just a weed control technology. You plow over and under the previous year’s crop. But if you have the right combinations of environment-friendly herbicides and the agricultural crops that are resistant to those herbicides, you don’t need to plow. No-plow agriculture saves topsoil and energy. Once you don’t need so much nitrogen fertilizer or complex pesticides, you can get to an agriculture that is much more en­ergy efficient. You can also breed in drought resistance.
People will be healthier as a result. And it will allow us to restore many habitats, because we’ll be using less land to grow food.
S+B: What about the fears about genetically modified foods?
HASELTINE: The technology is rapidly spreading, despite the European opposition. It’s spreading in many parts of the world because of its obvious advantages. For example, meat is a highly inefficient source of protein; over the next 20 to 30 years, people will move from meat to plants as a source of protein. I’ve been in Chinese restaurants that serve something that looks like a fish with skin and scales, but it’s entirely made out of soy protein, which is a plant product. You see a chicken that looks like a chicken, it’s carved like a chicken, but it’s not a chicken. You can make foods look and taste very attractive with manipulation, which, in this case, involves a process to spin soy proteins into fibers.
S+B: Do you think the bioenergy industry will move ahead faster than the pharmaceutical industry has in the last 20 years in its commercialization of genomic discoveries?
HASELTINE: The technology that might justify this amount of investment is finally emerging. Breakthroughs in the last few years have rapidly attracted large sums of investment capital. The Center for Synthetic Biology received its first half-billion-dollar grant less than a year and a half after showing proof of feasibility for the petroleum substitutes. Of course, that’s not how it usually happens. People don’t usu­ally make huge breakthroughs and all of a sudden have a venture capitalist say, “OK, let’s go.” But the volatility of oil prices has made investors realize that this can be very important.
I guarantee you that there are similar programs in constructive biology (though they may not use that name) at all the major chemical and energy companies. They too are looking at making petroleum substitutes. This type of activity doesn’t happen in isolation. When a group puts $1 billion into research, it gets people’s attention.
We also see the rise of very strong scientific communities in this field in other parts of the world. I have been working very closely with the leadership of the government of India. India’s Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, which is one of its major funding agencies, has fostered an alliance between a large group of Indian scientists and our group at Berkeley. We’re planning to [form similar alliances] with scientists in South America and China.
S+B: How challenging will it be to create the infrastructures for producing and distributing bioenergy?
HASELTINE: Constructive biology has the opportunity to produce power and transportation fuels that are fully compatible with our existing infrastructure or system. We might not need as many re­fineries, but we will still need the tankers, pipelines, and transport system.
There are still some major engineering problems. If you’re going to use a marine microorganism as your photosynthetic source of energy, how do you engineer that to be environmentally safe and efficient? We can solve the biology problems pretty quickly. We can make the prototype organisms. But can we build the infrastructure at the large scale that will allow us to produce fuel from them?
I think the engineering problem is going to be solved, but there has to be a business motive to do that, and the motive will depend on the cost of energy and its environmental impacts.
S+B: Most people, of course, still think of biotech as medical innovation. In that light, what is the significance of personalized medicine?
HASELTINE: In my mind, medicine has always been personal, if practiced properly. You are sick and a doctor interacts with you as an individual. This is one of the only times in your life when you have a professional response fully tailored to you as an individual. A good doctor wants to know about you and only you. Maybe he wants to know something about your family members, but that’s because of their relationship to you. If medicine isn’t personal, and isn’t therefore personalized, then it’s not really useful.
When people talk about personalized medicine they tend to focus on genetic inheritance, be­cause it is fascinating to peer into your genetic past and present. But modern genetics, at best, is like looking at your future through a glass darkly. With very few exceptions, such as Huntington’s disease, you can’t say that if you have an inherited trait you’ll get the related disease. In most cases, you have a probability between 10 percent and 0.1 percent of getting the disease; you don’t know when or even if the disease will appear.
Ninety percent of breast cancer seems to have nothing to do with inherited genes. The same is true of prostate cancer in men. There is some role for genetics in predictive medicine, but it’s a much smaller role than people think.
I believe the whole field of what’s called genetic medicine is not really ready for prime time, if it will ever be ready. If I seem negative, it isn’t because I think genetics is unimportant. It is just that genetic inheritance is a very minor aspect of genomics, whereas the applications that I’ve already outlined — energy, agriculture, and materials — are here and important now.
However, there is one tremendous breakthrough that I consider the ultimate personalization of medicine — using your cells to build new, healthier organs. Regenerative medicine involves developing your body’s own replacement organs and tissues if they are lopped off, damaged, broken, or diseased. Combine that with materials science and you begin to build organs. I just was visiting Dr. Anthony Atala at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. He leads an organization that is building new human organs. These are not artificial organs; they are made of your own cells.
It’s going to be possible to build a new pancreas for a person who is a diabetic. We will be able to regrow a retina, a heart muscle, and eventually even an entire heart. This is happening because, through genomics, we understand what a cell is doing, we can move genes in and out of cells, and now we have the ability to move genes around the body.
Another, more immediate benefit is differential diagnosis. Because we can define most of the things a cell does, we can define the characteristics of diseases much more precisely. For example, we used to look at leukemia as one type of white-cell disorder, but it turns out that there are perhaps 20 different leukemia diseases. Each will take a different course; each will require a different treatment.
Modern biology has also given doctors more techniques for understanding the disease you have in its current state. Your genes can tell you what you inherited, but they can’t tell you how your cells are behaving now. If you think about a lot of cancer tests, they’re not about what you inherited. They’re about what your cancer is doing today.
S+B: What can you say about the progress of using genomics to create new drugs?
HASELTINE: There is no question that our knowledge has been helpful. But the problem also turned out to be much more complicated than anybody thought. People thought, for example, that maybe they would find a few extra genes that were involved in cancer. It turns out that almost every gene is involved in cancer at some level. And every cancer is genetically different. Even every cell in the cancer is different from every other cell. And maybe 20 or 30 major pathways are in­volved. Does gene re­search help us understand and solve cancer? Maybe it will give us some addi­tional insights. But it isn’t the answer to cancer.
S+B: Do you think advances in differential diagnosis will improve the pharmaceutical industry’s return on R&D in terms of profits and human health benefits?
HASELTINE: R&D expenses in the pharmaceutical industry have gone up 20-fold in the last 20 years. That’s even in adjusted dollars, per company and per industry. Meanwhile, productivity has de­creased by about a factor of 10. This is probably the biggest productivity collapse the world has ever seen, and it affects the whole industry, biotechnology companies included. When you look at the number of new compounds that are approved, it’s the sum of all the biotechnology, all the universities — the entire world trying to get approval for a new chemical.
So something is wrong, and I don’t believe it is the science, which is moving forward at a pace beyond belief. It must be structural. I’ve been an advisor to many pharmaceutical companies, and I’ve set up several biotech companies, so I have a triangulated view. Size is at the root of a lot of problems. Research and innovation is done best in small groups, but we now have pharmaceutical companies with $70 billion in sales, and they focus only on drugs that can have a broad impact. One product may be worth $5 billion to $7 billion in sales. If a company loses its bet on two or three of these, it’s lost its business.
Typically, marketing people lead these companies. They look over the research results and analyze what might “make” a market. If a drug doesn’t have a chance in the marketplace, they will demand changes to the testing to get a label on the drug to sell it. I call it the reverse Cinderella syndrome — taking a small foot and putting it into a big shoe. What’s the consequence? Drug after drug fails to create a mass market, or a drug gets approved when it shouldn’t and then gets withdrawn because of side effects.
One solution would be to create “virtual” pharmaceutical com­pany structures, where you have many small companies with access to capital and scientists who understand the medical needs. Expenses would be kept minimal through outsourcing. Expertise would be consolidated so it isn’t redundant. Companies would aim their products at smaller markets. It may be a $50 million or $300 million market, but if they don’t invest much, they would make a lot of money.
Some of those drugs will be blockbusters, although you can’t predict which ones. Those drugs will go into the mass market, but you will have drugs selling at a much lower margin. It will be more like cosmetics companies, which aren’t bad businesses. To be an Estée Lauder, you need 4,000 products and 2,000 changes every year.
It’s not going to be easy, but it can be done. A new generation of pharmaceutical executives is rising in the industry, although it will be the next CEO cycle before we see significant change. I predicted that the pharmaceutical price-to-earnings ratio would change from about the mid-20s to the low teens, and [now] I think it’s going to go to the single digits. When it does, people are going to reevaluate how they do research. There will be tremendous opportunities to do things differently and better.
S+B: You mentioned the breakthrough in creating an antimalarial drug that will be affordable to populations who need it most. Can we expect the next wave of medical and green genomics to reach more of the two-thirds of the world’s people who live at the “bottom of the pyramid,” in lower-income countries?
HASELTINE: When the Soviet Union fell and the Cold War ended, the Russians, the Chinese, and the Indians all joined the global econ­omy. C.K. Prahalad’s The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid: Eradicating Poverty through Profits [Wharton School Publishing, 2004] was one of the first books to recognize this. It is a profound work that is now changing the thinking of a new generation of leaders. What is about to happen, and is already happening in India, is a reorientation of business toward the 2 billion people worldwide who are emerging from poverty. This is a fundamental transformation.
S+B: And it’s not just about selling consumer goods to them.
HASELTINE: Absolutely not. The rest of the world is going to want energy, more food and better food, and good medicine. The structures that we currently have in place cannot deliver all of those things to so many people without destroying our world.
That’s why we have to get away from petroleum-based energy. Agriculture needs to be much more efficient. We need to feed more people and to feed them well. Many solutions lie in biotechnology. It takes twice as much water, and I think about five times as much energy, to feed a meat eater as it does to feed a vegetarian. There is a tremendous savings to be had in promoting a vegetarian diet, and I think the world will move in that direction.
I am working in India now through a foundation I’ve created to deliver high-quality, cost-efficient health care. I believe it’s possible to get equal quality at a cost be­tween 10 and 20 percent below current costs. (See “The Innovation Sandbox,” by C.K. Prahalad, s+b, Autumn 2006.) There are a number of experimental enterprises using technology to create high-quality, af­fordable, low-cost health care for the Indian middle and lower-middle classes. These are self-sustaining, profitable organizations. There is a tremendous amount of experi­mentation. The common theme is, How do you solve the problems of getting high-quality health care at very low cost to very large numbers of people?
That is not just a problem for health; it’s a problem for the whole economy. How do you provide efficient energy, health care, food, and services to very large numbers of people? India is a great laboratory, because of its demographics and mix of high-tech wealth and poverty. And hopefully those solutions then get translated to another 2 billion people globally.
S+B: Are you saying that the innovations spawned by biotechnologies can help eliminate the “have” and “have-not” economic extremes?
HASELTINE: You’ll never see an end to economic disparity, but you will see unprecedented upward mo­bility in the developing world. We are already seeing something like 35 million to 40 million people a year moving into India’s and China’s middle classes. Think of it as a quarter of the United States’ total pop­ulation joining the middle class each year. Remember, it was middle- to lower-middle-income Amer­­icans, not the upper class, that drove the world economy until very recently.
Mass markets are very powerful, even when the price points are low. So we’re seeing these huge transformations take place, and I think that they can continue, but we need to solve the production problems in order to make these lifestyles sustainable on our planet.
S+B: Can industrial society be sustainable when there are nearly 10 billion people on the planet?
HASELTINE: Yes, if we replace our current generation of wasteful technologies. Biotechnologies will have a significant role in that change. If you look at the full range of what we’ve talked about, we have gone from burning wood to regrowing arteries. That’s a pretty broad span of life sciences, and it’s tremendously exciting.

  North Pole and South Pole, is tilted about 23° from the oval that describes its orbit around the Sun. Earth always points in the same direction as it moves around the Sun, so for half the year (summer in the Northern Hemisphere), the North Pole is pointed slightly toward the Sun, keeping it in daylight all the time because the Sun lights up the half of Earth that is facing it (and the North Pole is always in that half due to the tilt). For the other half of the orbit, the South Pole is tilted slightly toward the Sun, and it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere. This means that at the equator, the Sun is not directly overhead at noon, except around the March and September equinoxes, when one spot on the equator is pointed directly at the Sun.

  Orbital mechanics require that the duration of the seasons be proportional to the area of Earth's orbit swept between the solstices and equinoxes, so when the orbital eccentricity is extreme, the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit (aphelion) can be substantially longer in duration. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring

  The fact that the stars visible from the north and south poles do not overlap must mean that the two observation spots are on opposite sides of Earth, which is not possible if Earth is a single-sided disk, but is possible for other shapes (like a sphere, but also any other convex shape like a donut or dumbbell). The North Pole is in continuous night for six months of the year. The same hemisphere of stars (a 180° view) are always visible while it is dark, making one counterclockwise rotation every 24 hours. The star Polaris (the "North Star") is almost directly overhead and therefore at the center of this rotation.

  a point directly overhead, where there do not happen to be any particularly bright stars. From any point on the equator, all of the stars visible anywhere on Earth on that day are visible over the course of the night as the sky rotates around a line drawn from due north to due south. When facing east, the stars visible from the north pole are on the left, and the stars visible from the south pole are on the right. This means the equator must be facing at a 90° angle from the poles. The direction any intermediate spot on Earth is facing can also be calculated by measuring the angles

  On a flat Earth, a Sun that shines in all directions would illuminate the entire surface at the same time, and all places would experience sunrise and sunset at the horizon at about the same time. With a spherical Earth, half the planet is in daylight at any given time and the other half experiences nighttime. When a given location on the spherical Earth is in sunlight, its antipode – the location exactly on the opposite side of Earth – is in darkness. The spherical shape of Earth causes the Sun to rise and set at different times in different places, and different locations get different amounts of sunlight

  The summer solstice, also known as estival solstice or midsummer, occurs when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky (for areas outside of the tropics) and is the day with the longest period of daylight. Within the Arctic circle (for the northern hemisphere) or Antarctic circle (for the southern hemisphere), there is continuous daylight around the summer solstice. On the summer solstice, Earth's maximum axial tilt toward the Sun is 23.44°. Likewise, the Sun's declination from the celestial equator is 23.44°. The summer solstice occurs during summer. This is the

   The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun. In each instance, winter occurs simultaneously in the opposite hemisphere. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In

    The seasons result from the Earth's axis of rotation being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.4 degrees. (This tilt is also known as "obliquity of the ecliptic".) Regardless of the time of year, the northern and southern hemispheres always experience opposite seasons. This is because during summer or winter, one part of the planet is more directly exposed to the rays of the Sun than the other, and this exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. For approximately half of the year (from around March20 to around September22), the Northern Hemisphere

  the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible. For example, New York City is about 40° north of the equator. The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°). So for example, both Orion and the Big Dipper are visible during at least part of the year. Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points, makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for Earth.

Answer:
2024-06-11 18:13:40 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background: This day marks the approximate midpoint of summer in the Northern Hemisphere and of winter in the Southern Hemisphere (starting the season at the June solstice). The summer solstice, also known as estival solstice or midsummer, occurs when one of Earth's poles has its maximum tilt toward the Sun. It happens twice yearly, once in each hemisphere (Northern and Southern). For that hemisphere, the summer solstice is when the Sun reaches its highest position in the sky (for areas outside of the tropics) and is the day with the longest period of daylight. The summer solstice occurs during summer. Today, northern hemisphere autumn and winter occur at closest approach (perihelion), when Earth is moving at its maximum velocity—while the opposite occurs in the southern hemisphere. As a result, in the northern hemisphere, autumn and winter are slightly shorter than spring and summer—but in global terms this is balanced with them being longer below the equator. In 2006, the northern hemisphere summer was 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring 

   The seasons result from the Earth's axis of rotation being tilted with respect to its orbital plane by an angle of approximately 23.4 degrees. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and in the Southern Hemisphere when the Tropic of Capricorn faces the Sun.

 For mental health, skin health, and hair growth, there are several vitamins and minerals that play important roles.

For mental health, one important vitamin is vitamin B12. It is required for the production of neurotransmitters, which are involved in regulating mood and cognitive function. Another important B vitamin is vitamin B6, which is involved in the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that affects mood. Additionally, adequate intake of vitamin D has been linked to improved mental health outcomes, including a reduced risk of depression.

In terms of skin health, vitamin A is essential. It helps in the formation and maintenance of healthy skin cells. Vitamin C is also important for skin health as it aids in collagen synthesis, which is vital for the structure and elasticity of the skin. Vitamin E is an antioxidant vitamin that protects the skin from damage caused by free radicals and supports overall skin health.

When it comes to hair growth, vitamins E and C play significant roles. Vitamin E helps improve blood circulation in the scalp, promoting hair growth, while vitamin C is important for collagen production, which strengthens the hair follicles.

In addition to vitamins, minerals also contribute to these aspects of health. Magnesium is known to help fight depression and promote relaxation. Calcium is important for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and skin. Zinc is involved in many processes in the body, including protein synthesis, which is necessary for hair growth.

It's important to note that a balanced and varied diet is the best way to ensure adequate intake of these vitamins and minerals. However, if you have concerns about your nutrient levels, it is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional before considering any supplements.

• **Give short-term protection with an injection of specific hepatitis B antibody (immunoglobulin).**

• **Give a first dose of hepatitis B vaccine.One in 12 people—500 million—live with chronic viral hepatitis B or C. Not all of them are aware of their condition. One could easily infect you if you do not take sensible precautions. ### **What to look for**

Fever, nausea, vomiting, extreme fatigue and pain in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen. Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and eyes, dark urine and pale stools. If your skin turns yellow but the whites of your eyes stay crystal clear, and you feel well, you probably do not have jaundice. Skin discoloration can be caused by eating too many carrots—and cheaptanning products. ### **What are the chances of survival? **

There is no specific treatment for acute hepatitis. Nine out of 10 adults who develop viral hepatitis recover. Antiviral drugs can suppress chronic infection in HBV and HPC, but these are expensive and not readily available in developing countries. **HOW TO AVOID IT**

• **Maintain good hygiene and sanitation (hepatitis A, E). **

• **Get vaccinated if you are at risk (hepatitis A, B). **

• **Keep cuts and skin lesions covered (hepatitis B, C and D). **

• **Practice safer sex and never share needles if injecting drugs (hepatitis B, C and D). **

• **Avoid dodgy tattoos and needle stick injuries (hepatitis B, C and D). **

• **Avoid contact with infected clothing contaminated with vomit or feces (hepatitis A, B, C, D and E). **

**Emergency protection against hepatitis B infection is available. If an unprotected individual is exposed to risk of infection (e.g. needle stick injury), the routine procedure is to:**

• **Take blood and test for preexisting protective levels of hepatitis B antibodies. **

• **Give a first dose of hepatitis B vaccine. **

• **Give short-term protection with an injection of specific hepatitis B antibody (immunoglobulin). **

## **45 Homicide**

**Homicide is the act of killing another person. Some cases are considered justified, for example, in self-defense. Others are premeditated and classed as murder.**

Every year, an astonishing 1.6 million people lose their lives to acts of human violence, of which 525,000 are considered murder—that's roughly one life taken by another person every 60 seconds worldwide.Interpersonal violence is the leading cause of death in people aged 15–44 years, accounting for 14% of male deaths and 7% of female deaths in this age group.**Who dies?

The daughter nucleus can only stay in that excited state for a small amount of time (the half life of the level) after which it suffers a series of gamma transitions to its lower energy levels. These transitions allow the daughter nucleus to emit the excitation energy as one or more gamma rays until it reaches its ground state, thus getting rid of all the excitation energy that it kept from the decay.

 by direct beta feeding from the beta decay of the parent into the daughter (Iβ), ; by gamma transitions of higher energy levels (previously beta-populated from the direct beta decay of the parent) into lower energy levels (ΣIi). Typically, when a parent nucleus beta-decays into its daughter, there is some final energy available which is shared between the final products of the decay. This is called the Q value of the beta decay (Qβ). The daughter nucleus doesn't necessarily end up in the ground state after the decay, this only happens when the other products have taken all the available energy with them (usually as kinetic energy).

The daughter nucleus can only stay in that excited state for a small amount of time (the half life of the level) after which it suffers a series of gamma transitions to its lower energy levels. These transitions allow the daughter nucleus to emit the excitation energy as one or more gamma rays until it reaches its ground state, thus getting rid of all the excitation energy that it kept from the decay. According to this, the energy levels of the daughter nucleus can be populated in two ways: The total gamma rays emitted by an energy level (IT) should be equal to

    Planetary geology, alternatively known as astrogeology or exogeology, is a planetary science discipline concerned with the geology of the celestial bodies such as the planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. Although the geo- prefix typically indicates topics of or relating to Earth, planetary geology is named as such for historical and convenience reasons; due to the types of investigations involved, it is closely linked with Earth-based geology. Planetary geology includes such topics as determining the internal structure of the terrestrial planets, and also looks at planetary volcanism and surface processes such as impact craters, fluvial and aeolian processes. The structures and compositions of the giant planets and their moons are also examined, as is the make-up of the minor bodies of the Solar System, such as asteroids, the Kuiper Belt, and comets. Planetary geology includes applications derived from other closely related fields within in the geological sciences, such as geophysics and geochemistry.

  The congenital defect microtia, deformed or unformed outer ear, can be associated with partial or complete conductive deafness, depending upon the severity of the deformity and whether the middle ear is also affected. It can also be associated with abnormalities of the inner ear giving rise to an additional sensorineural component to the hearing loss (mixed deafness). ; Dozens of additional genes for nonsyndromic deafness have been identified. Hearing loss can be inherited. Around 75–80% of all these cases are inherited by recessive genes, 20–25% are inherited by dominant genes, 1–2% are inherited by X-linked patterns, and fewer than 1% are inherited by mitochondrial inheritance. When looking at the genetics of deafness, there are 2 different forms, syndromic and nonsyndromic. Syndromic deafness occurs when there are other signs or medical problems aside

  In Mendelian inheritance, genes have only two alleles, such as a and A. Mendel consciously chose pairs of genetic traits, represented by two alleles for his inheritance experiments. In nature, such genes often exist in several different forms and are therefore said to have multiple alleles. An individual, of course, usually has only two copies of each gene, but many different alleles are often found within a population. A rabbit's coat color is determined by a single gene that has at least four different alleles. They display a pattern of a dominance-hierarchy that can produce four coat colors. In the genes for the dog coat colours there are four alleles on the Agouti-locus. The allele "aw" is dominant over the alleles "at" and "a" but recessive under "Ay". Many other genes have multiple alleles, including the human genes for ABO blood type.

  One of the characteristics of the Williams syndrome has been described as "pointed ears". There are also cases of people being born with pointed ears not associated to William's syndrome. In one family a woman was born with two pointed ears, she later had a son with two less dramatically pointed ears, and she had a great uncle with one pointed ear. Some cases of pointed ears may be due to trauma to ears during labor, and the ear crease may unfold with time. The pointed ear(s) in Stahl's ear is caused by misshapen cartilage. It is characterized by an extra horizontal fold of cartilage (crus). Normally, there are two: superior and inferior. In Stahl's ear, there is a third horizontal crus.

  A gene is said to be polymorphic if more than one allele occupies that gene's locus within a population. In addition to having more than one allele at a specific locus, each allele must also occur in the population at a rate of at least 1% to generally be considered polymorphic. Gene polymorphisms can occur in any region of the genome. The majority of polymorphisms are silent, meaning they do not alter the function or expression of a gene. Some polymorphisms are visible. For example, in dogs the E locus can have any of five different alleles, known as E, Em, Eg,

 Editor’s Note: This article is not meant to help the lay person diagnose and treat head tilt, and any rabbit showing signs of head tilt should be taken to the vet without delay.
A bunny with a head tilt is a very sad sight. Are we doing the right thing to keep him alive? Is he still happy? Will he ever be cured? These are the questions for most in our minds when one of our rabbits suddenly develops this problem.
An inner ear infection may have started with an outer ear infection, which remained unnoticed and untreated and gradually worked its way into the inner ear, or with a middle ear infection, which resulted from an upper respiratory infection. Or it may have arisen from bacteria in the nasal cavity or bloodstream. A radiograph of the head may help determine if the middle ears are affected. Some of the bacteria which have been cultured from ear infections are Staphylococcus sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pasteurella multocida, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Proteus mirabilis, Streptoccus epidermidis, Bacteroides spp. and Escherichia coli.
Treatment needs to be aggressive and prolonged. If exudate (pus) is found deep in the ear canal, a culture and sensitivity should be done in order to determine the bacterial agent and which antibiotics will be most effective in eliminating the infection. However, if it is impossible to access the bacteria in order to do the culture, many veterinarians will opt to treat with one of the antibiotics usually successful in curing an inner ear infection, such as enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol or penicillin G procaine with benzathaine. If no improvement is noticed after 4 weeks, a change in antibiotic is recommended.
If attempts to clear the infection with antibiotics appear to be failing, the veterinarian may suggest ear surgery to be able to obtain a sample for a culture and sensitivity, to remove exudate, and to provide drainage. Antibiotics need to be withheld for 3 days prior to obtaining a culture. One treatment includes leaving a drain. However, the exudate that rabbits produce is frequently very thick and does not drain.
If the head tilt is extreme, a steroid may be prescribed in an attempt to reduce the inflammation. If the rabbit is not eating or drinking, the doctor may recommend that fluids be administered subcutaneously and food given orally by syringe.
Although middle and inner ear infections reportedly have a poor cure rate, I know many cases of success in getting rabbits through this illness. The “secret” is long term antibiotics, frequently a minimum of 30 days. However it may be necessary for a rabbit to be on antibiotics for 6 months or even for the remaining years of his life. This treatment in conjunction with a loving and supportive environment can provide the rabbit with a good quality of life even if the disease cannot be completely eradicated.
Stroke is usually suspected on the basis of physical signs. Imaging to diagnose this problem is available to humans but difficult to arrange for companion rabbits. As in humans, acerbrovascular accident can kill, but if it does not, then the rabbit may initially be left with one side of his face, and perhaps one entire side of his body affected. One side of his face will droop, he may drool, and one eye may not function properly. He may not move normally or may move in circles. Function usually will slowly return over a period of months. Almost three years after a stroke, one of my rabbits has only a slight tilt to his head, unnoticeable, unless pointed out. Benny just looks a bit quizzical.
Care for a bunny who has suffered a stroke involves nursing him through his difficulties in eating, drinking and moving. Antibiotics do not help these cases, but sometimes are given to help rule out infection. Acupuncture should also be considered in treatment of these cases.
A blow to the face, neck or head can result in an injury to the brain which can cause the rabbit to have a head tilt. Trauma even could result from a panic reaction. Depending upon the severity of the trauma, an anti-inflammatory might be helpful to speed recovery.
Tumors occurring in the brain, neck or ear could produce a symptom of head tilt.
A “muscle spasm” could cause a temporary head tilt. This situation will resolve itself once the muscle is relaxed.
Encephalitozoon cuniculi, a protozoan parasite, can cause brain disease (meningooencephalitis and microscopic cysts), and can result in paralysis anywhere in the body, since every part of the body is controlled by a specific part of the brain. (See the HRJ Vol. III No. 2 for a detailed description of this parasite.) Frequently there are signs preceding a head tilt caused by E.cuniculi such as tripping, dragging of feet, tipping over. These symptoms may have appeared and then vanished weeks or months prior to the head tilt. A blood test for antibodies to E. cuniculi can tell whether your rabbit has been exposed.
Baylisascaris spp are round worms which live in the intestine of raccoons and skunks. A rabbit may acquire eggs from these works by eating grasses, food, or bedding contaminated by feces. Larvae hatch from the eggs and migrate into the brain, where they live and grow and destroy brain tissue. There is no known cure for this invasion. Ivermectin probably does not penetrate the brain in sufficient quantities to kill the larvae, although it may kill them before they reach the brain.
This could be caused by ingestion of lead, found in paints or imported pottery, or ingestion of a toxic plant such as the woolly pod milkweed.
Regardless of the cause, most cases of head tilt have similarities.
The “down” eye (the one facing the floor) will usually not close and will require eye ointment to keep the eye moist.
Lack of balance is what causes rabbits to “roll” and be unable to stand, so I try to pick them up as little as possible. When you must pick your rabbit up, hold him securely against your own body, to help him feel as stable as possible. Depending upon the size of your rabbit you can usually figure out how to confine him to a smaller space (perhaps a sweater box with the higher sides). Place one of the synthetic sheepskin rugs (that allows urine to pass through but will keep the bun dry) on the floor of the cage or box, and then place rolled towels or small blankets to help prop him up, so that he will be less likely to roll when he loses his balance. A stuffed toy bunny friend also helps.
Most rabbits will keep eating but may need to be hand fed with lots of sympathy with every bite of food. He may not want his pellets, but he will usually eat a variety of fresh green veggies, carrots and fruits if you hold them for him. It may help to switch from timothy to alfalfa hay to encourage him to eat lots of roughage.
If your rabbit decides to decline food, you will have to be ready to syringe feed him. There are many recipes for syringe feeding and you can be fairly creative. The primary point is to get food into his stomach so that his gut doesn’t stop moving, which would add further complications to the process of getting him well. A sample recipe might be pellets mixed with 2 parts water, mixed garden baby food, some banana, some powdered acidophilus, some apple sauce (some of whatever he usually likes that has a strong taste). Feed him as frequently as possible throughout the day, and as much as you can get down him at each feeding. When he clenches his teeth and won’t swallow, stop for awhile and try more later.
While many cases of head tilt can be successfully treated, others cannot. Blackberry, a wonderfully large 3-year-old French lop, was adopted by a rabbit-loving family and lived happily in her humans’ two story house. Three years later, Blackberry was diagnosed with an inner ear infection. She was on antibiotics for months and went through various periods of syringe feeding. She was getting better all the while and then suddenly had a stroke. She fought that for another month and then died after another stroke. The postmortem exam showed that the inner ear infection she was fighting was almost cleared up. We don’t know why she also suffered a stroke, but Blackberry was a brave and valiant fighter, unwilling to let go of life without a battle.
Regardless of the cause, sometimes a rabbit who survives will be left with a slight head tilt for the rest of his life. I’ve found that while the rabbit will adjust rapidly, his caregiver is the one who may have more difficulty accepting the “cosmetics” of the situation. Rabbits are mighty fighters and you can help him in his fight by offering lots of sympathy and carrots.

A doe typically nurses the kits only once per day. Kits may show growth rates of up to 35 to 40 grams per day. Lactation peaks at 3 weeks postpartum. The kits start eating solid food at 2 weeks of age and cecotrophy, the consumption of feces directly from the anus, commences about a week later. Weaning should take place at 5 to 6 weeks. ## Anatomy and physiology

Rabbits have a number of distinguishing morphophysiologic attributes that make them interesting and differentiate them from more traditional pets. For example, rabbits importantly use cecal bacterial fermentation in digestion, cannot vomit, have a narrow pylorus, and engage in cecotrophy. In some part due to the latter three characteristics, they rarely have an empty stomach. The ears are highly vascularized and serve in heat dissipation. Their ears are fragile and rabbits should never be restrained or carried by the ears. Rabbits have a high muscle-to-bone ratio. While 13% of the body weight is comprised of bone in the cat, only 8% is bone in the rabbit (Harkness & Wagner 1989). Because they are engulfed in large muscle masses, the long bones and lumbar spine are particularly at risk of fracture or luxation, respectively. For rabbits used as pets and in research, this is an unfortunate characteristic that can be attributed to a heritage of development for maximal meat production. Three in five rabbits will have atropinesterase in the serum, which rapidly hydrolyzes atropine, essentially rendering the agent unpredictable to worthless in effect. Like cats, rabbits are prone to laryngospasm and may be a challenge to intubate owing to the combination of a small glottis, narrow oropharynx, relatively large and fleshy tongue, and other anatomic factors. The skeletal anatomy of the rabbit is shown in Figure 15.1. **Figure 15.1** Rabbit skeletal anatomy. (Drawing by Scott Stark.)The inguinal canals remain open for the life of the buck and the testicles may interchangeably be found in the scrotum or retracted into the abdomen.Herniation of other intraabdominal organs is prevented by large fat depots immediately covering the canals (Swindle & Shealy 1996).Figure 15.2 shows rabbit visceral anatomy.**Figure 15.2** Rabbit visceral anatomy.(Drawing by Scott Stark.)

In one family a woman was born with two pointed ears, she later had a son with two less dramatically pointed ears, and she had a great uncle with one pointed ear. Some cases of pointed ears may be due to trauma to ears during labor, and the ear crease may unfold with time. The pointed ear(s) in Stahl's ear is caused by misshapen cartilage. It is characterized by an extra horizontal fold of cartilage (crus). Normally, there are two: superior and inferior. In Stahl's ear, there is a third horizontal crus. The helix (or upper portion of the ear) may uncurl, giving the ear a pointed shape.

  At temperatures greater than 44 C, proteins begin losing their three-dimensional shape and start breaking down. This results in cell and tissue damage. Many of the direct health effects of a burn are secondary to disruption in the normal functioning of the skin. They include disruption of the skin's sensation, ability to prevent water loss through evaporation, and ability to control body temperature. Disruption of cell membranes causes cells to lose potassium to the spaces outside the cell and to take up water and sodium. In large burns (over 30% of the total body surface area), there is a significant inflammatory response. This results in increased leakage of fluid from the capillaries, and subsequent tissue edema. This causes overall blood volume loss, with the remaining blood suffering significant plasma loss, making the blood more concentrated. Poor blood flow to organs such as the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract may result in kidney failure and stomach ulcers. Increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol can cause a hypermetabolic state that can last for years. This is associated with increased cardiac output, metabolism, a fast heart rate, and poor immune function.

  In the United States, fire and hot liquids are the most common causes of burns. Of house fires that result in death, smoking causes 25% and heating devices cause 22%. Almost half of injuries are due to efforts to fight a fire. Scalding is caused by hot liquids or gases and most commonly occurs from exposure to hot drinks, high temperature tap water in baths or showers, hot cooking oil, or steam. Scald injuries are most common in children under the age of five and, in the United States and Australia, this population makes up about two-thirds of all burns. Contact with hot objects is the cause of about 20–30% of burns in children. Generally, scalds are first- or second-degree burns, but third-degree burns may also result, especially with prolonged contact. Fireworks are a common cause of burns during holiday seasons in many countries. This is a particular risk for adolescent males. In the United States, For non-fatal burn injuries, white males, aged <6 comprise most cases. Thermal burns from grabbing/touching and spilling/splashing were the most common type of burn and mechanism, while the bodily areas most impacted were hands and fingers followed by head/neck.

  Older people are more likely to suffer from heatstroke than younger people due to dysfunctional thermoregulatory mechanisms, chronic dehydration, medication, and diseases involving the thermoregulatory system. If left untreated, heatstroke can fail to reduce body temperature rapidly, which is fatal, and survivors may suffer long-term disability.

  A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or ultraviolet radiation (like sunburn). Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids (called scalding), solids, or fire. While rates are similar for males and females, the underlying causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self-harm or violence between people (assault). Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or

  Abscesses may occur in any kind of tissue but most frequently within the skin surface (where they may be superficial pustules known as boils or deep skin abscesses), in the lungs, brain, teeth, kidneys, and tonsils. Major complications may include spreading of the abscess material to adjacent or remote tissues, and extensive regional tissue death (gangrene). The main symptoms and signs of a skin abscess are redness, heat, swelling, pain, and loss of function. There may also be high temperature (fever) and chills. If superficial, abscesses may be fluctuant when palpated; this wave-like motion is caused by movement of the pus inside the abscess. An internal abscess is more difficult to identify, but signs include pain in the affected area, a high temperature, and generally feeling unwell. Internal abscesses rarely heal themselves, so prompt medical attention is indicated if such an abscess is suspected. An abscess can potentially be fatal depending on where it is located.

  The heart is a muscular organ situated in the mediastinum. It consists of four chambers, four valves, two main arteries (named as coronary arteries), and the conduction system. The left and right sides of the heart have different functions: the right side receives blood coming from the body through the superior and inferior venae cavae and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary artery, while the left side receives saturated blood from the lungs.

  In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle constitutes the majority of muscle mass in the body and is responsible for locomotor activity. Smooth muscle forms blood vessels, gastrointestinal tract, and other areas in the body that produce sustained contractions. Cardiac muscle make up the heart, which pumps blood. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are called striated muscle because of their striped appearance under a microscope, which is due to the highly organized alternating pattern of A bands and I bands.

   Derived from the Greek ἀνατομή anatomē "dissection" (from ἀνατέμνω anatémnō "I cut up, cut open" from ἀνά aná "up", and τέμνω témnō "I cut"), anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs and tissues. It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts. Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved. For example, an anatomist is concerned with the shape, size, position, structure, blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile, the

  Muscle cells (myocytes) form the active contractile tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.

  The heart has the shape of a pyramid, with its apex pointing towards the left nipple while its base forms the posterior surface of the heart. Other surfaces are the anterior, inferior (or diaphragmatic), and two pulmonary surfaces facing the lungs. Its longest dimension (apical to base) is broadly 12–13 cm, while the average weight is 250 grams in females and 300 grams in males.

 Body parts affected by autoimmune diseases include the heart, brain, nerves, muscles, skin, eyes, joints, lungs, kidneys, glands, the digestive tract, blood vessels etcetera. The classic sign of an autoimmune disease is inflammation, which can cause redness, heat, pain, and swelling. How an autoimmune disease affects you depends on what part of the body it targets.
If an autoimmune disease affects the joints, as in Rheumatoid Arthritis, you might have joint pain, stiffness, and loss of functions. If it affects the thyroid, as in Graves’ Disease and Thyroiditis, it might cause tiredness, weight gain, and muscle aches. If it attacks the skin, as it does in Scleroderma, Sclerosis, Vitiligo, and Lupus (SLE), it can cause rashes, blisters, and color changes. Many autoimmune diseases don’t restrict themselves to one part of the body.
For Example: Lupus can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, nerves, blood vessels, and more. Type 1 Diabetes can affect your glands, eyes, kidneys, muscles, and more. No one is sure what causes autoimmune diseases. In most cases, a combination of factors is probably at work.
For Example: You might have a genetic tendency to develop a disease and then, under the right conditions, an outside invader like a virus might trigger it. The acquired immune system develops as a person grows. It “remembers” invaders so that it can fight them if they come back. When the immune system is working properly, foreign invaders provoke the body to activate immune cells against the invaders and to produce proteins called antibodies that attach to the invaders so they can be recognized and destroyed. The more primitive, innate, or inborn immune system activates white blood cells to destroy invaders, without using antibodies.
The definitions of illness and disease are equally difficult problems. Despite the fact that these terms are often used interchangeably, illness is not to be equated with disease. A person may have a disease for many years without even being aware of its presence. Although diseased, this person is not ill. Similarly, a person with diabetes who has received adequate insulin treatment is not ill. An individual who has cancer is often totally unaware of having the disorder and is not ill until after many years of growth of the tumour, during which time it has caused no symptoms. The term illness implies discomfort or inability to function optimally. Hence it is a subjective state of lack of well-being produced by disease. Regrettably, many diseases escape detection and possible cure because they remain symptom less for long years before they produce discomfort or impair function.
Disease, defined as any deviation from normal form and function, may be trivial if the deviation is minimal. A minor skin infection might be considered trivial, for example. On the eyelid, however, such an infection could produce considerable discomfort or illness. Any departure from the state of health, then, is a disease, whether health be measured in the theoretical terms of normal measured values or in the more pragmatic terms of ability to function effectively in harmony with one’s environment.
The Stomach (from ancient Greek στόμαχος, stomachos, stoma means mouth) is a muscular, hollow organ in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and many other animals, including several invertebrates. The stomach has a dilated structure and functions as a vital digestive organ. In the digestive system the stomach is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).
The Brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 10–20 billion neurons and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 55–70 billion. Each neuron is connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.
The Mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and produces saliva. The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane epithelium lining the inside of the mouth. In addition to its primary role as the beginning of the digestive system, in humans the mouth also plays a significant role in communication. While primary aspects of the voice are produced in the throat, the tongue, lips, and jaw are also needed to produce the range of sounds included in human language.
The Spinal Cord is a long, thin, tubular bundle of nervous tissue and support cells that extends from the medulla oblongata in the brainstem to the lumbar region of the vertebral column. The brain and spinal cord together make up the central nervous system (CNS). In humans, the spinal cord begins at the occipital bone where it passes through the foramen magnum, and meets and enters the spinal canal at the beginning of the cervical vertebrae. The spinal cord extends down to between the first and second lumbar vertebrae where it ends. The enclosing bony vertebral column protects the relatively shorter spinal cord. It is around 45 cm (18 in) in men and around 43 cm (17 in) long in women. Also, the spinal cord has a varying width, ranging from 13 mm (1⁄2 in) thick in the cervical and lumbar regions to 6.4 mm (1⁄4 in) thick in the thoracic area.
The Human Eye is an organ which reacts to light and pressure. As a sense organ, the mammalian eye allows vision. Human eyes help to provide a three dimensional, moving image, normally coloured in daylight. Rod and cone cells in the retina allow conscious light perception and vision including color differentiation and the perception of depth. The human eye can differentiate between about 10 million colors and is possibly capable of detecting a single photon. Similar to the eyes of other mammals, the human eye's non-image-forming photosensitive ganglion cells in the retina receive light signals which affect adjustment of the size of the pupil, regulation and suppression of the hormone melatonin and entrainment of the body clock.
The Joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones in the body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.
The Pancreas /ˈpæŋkriəs/ is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide, all of which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ.
The Lungs are the primary organs of the respiratory system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone on either side of the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via buccal pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm.
The Gastrointestinal tract (digestive tract, digestional tract, GI tract, GIT, gut, or alimentary canal) is an organ system within humans and other animals which takes in food, digests it to extract and absorb energy and nutrients, and expels the remaining waste as feces. The mouth, esophagus, stomach and intestines are part of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal is an adjective meaning of or pertaining to the stomach and intestines. A tract is a collection of related anatomic structures or a series of connected body organs. The gastrointestinal tract contains trillions of microbes, with some 4,000 different strains of bacteria having diverse roles in maintenance of immune health and metabolism.
The Blood Vessels are the part of the circulatory system, and microcirculation, that transports blood throughout the human body. There are three major types of blood vessels: the arteries, which carry the blood away from the heart; the capillaries, which enable the actual exchange of water and chemicals between the blood and the tissues; and the veins, which carry blood from the capillaries back toward the heart. The word vascular, meaning relating to the blood vessels, is derived from the Latin vas, meaning vessel. A few structures (such as cartilage and the lens of the eye) do not contain blood vessels and are labeled.
The Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs present in left and right sides of the body in vertebrates. They are located at the back of the abdominal cavity. In adults they are about 11 centimetres (4.3 in) in length. They receive blood from the paired renal arteries; blood exits into the paired renal veins. Each kidney is attached to a ureter, a tube that carries excreted urine to the bladder. The nephron is the structural and functional unit of the kidney. Each adult kidney contains around one million nephrons. The nephron utilizes four processes to alter the blood plasma which flows to it: filtration, reabsorption, secretion, and excretion. The kidney participates in the control of the volume of various body fluid compartments, fluid osmolality, acid-base balance, various electrolyte concentrations, and removal of toxins.
The Urinary Bladder is a hollow muscular organ in humans and some other animals that collects and stores urine from the kidneys before disposal by urination. In the human the bladder is a hollow muscular, and distensible (or elastic) organ, that sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. The typical human bladder will hold between 300 and 500 mL (10.14 and 16.91 fl oz) before the urge to empty occurs, but can hold considerably more.
The Heart is a muscular organ in most animals, which pumps blood through the blood vessels of the circulatory system. Blood provides the body with oxygen and nutrients, as well as assists in the removal of metabolic wastes. In humans, the heart is located between the lungs, in the middle compartment of the chest. The heart pumps blood with a rhythm determined by a group of pacemaking cells in the sinoatrial node. These generate a current that causes contraction of the heart, traveling through the atrioventricular node and along the conduction system of the heart.
The Liver, an organ only found in vertebrates, detoxifies various metabolites, synthesizes proteins, and produces biochemicals necessary for digestion. In humans, it is located in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, below the diaphragm. Its other roles in metabolism include the regulation of glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells and the production of hormones. The liver is an accessory digestive gland that produces bile, an alkaline compound which helps the breakdown of fat. Bile aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. The gallbladder, a small pouch that sits just under the liver, stores bile produced by the liver.

 Muscular dystrophy is a group of genetic muscle diseases that can affect various body systems. The most common types of muscular dystrophy include Duchenne, Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery-Dreifuss. However, there are more than 100 diseases in total that have similarities to muscular dystrophy.

Most types of muscular dystrophy are considered multi-system disorders. This means that they can affect multiple body systems. Some of the body systems that can be affected by muscular dystrophy include the heart, gastrointestinal system (which includes the stomach and intestines), nervous system (including nerves and the brain), endocrine glands (such as the thyroid or adrenal glands), skin, eyes, and other organs.

It is important to note that the specific effects on these body systems may vary depending on the type and severity of muscular dystrophy. Therefore, it is crucial for individuals with muscular dystrophy to receive appropriate medical care and management from healthcare professionals who specialize in this condition.

For the individual cell, the most immediate challenge is the safeguarding of its own energy supply. Beyond the imperative of self-preservation, however, cells and organs must cooperate unselfishly for the common good of the body. Together they must master the everyday challenges of fasting, feasting, and muscular activity as well as the less routine challenges of infectious illnesses. These challenges require the organism-wide coordination of metabolic pathways, achieved through hormonal and nervous signals. This chapter discusses the metabolic adaptations to environmental challenges and varying physiological needs, with special emphasis on the challenges posed by overeating and the resulting pathologies.Therefore their actions can be understood only in the context of the physiological conditions that cause their release.Insulin is the hormone of the well-fed state.It is released by the β-cells in the islets of Langerhans when the levels of blood glucose and other nutrients rise after a meal.There are approximately 1 million islets in the human pancreas.

  In meteorology, visibility is a measure of the distance at which an object or light can be clearly discerned. It depends only on the transparency of the surrounding air; as such, it is unchanging no matter the ambient light level or time of day. It is reported within surface weather observations and METAR code either in meters or statute miles, depending upon the country. Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing and aviation.

This is from Rayleigh scattering, which redirects higher frequency/shorter wavelength (blue) sunlight back into the field of view of the observer. ; The reddish color of the Sun when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as during a sunrise or sunset. This is because red light is scattered less than blue light. The red light reaches the observer's eye, whereas the blue light is scattered out of the line of sight. ; Other colours in the sky, such as glowing skies at dusk and dawn. These are from additional particulate matter in the sky that scatter different colors at different angles. ;

It was said to be the largest candle-powered light in the world at the time, which light could be seen on clear nights as far as seventy miles away by planes and visible on the ground as far as twenty-five miles from the hotel. On February 25, 1931, the lighthouse division of the Department of Commerce has ruled that only actual airway beacons could use white light. Experiments are conducted with colored lenses but prove unfeasible. The beacons on top of the McAlpin, the St. George and the Beacon go dark, never to be lit again.

  in magnitude corresponds to a brightness ratio of, or about 2.512. For example, a star of magnitude 2.0 is 2.512 times brighter than a star of magnitude 3.0, 6.31 times brighter than a star of magnitude 4.0, and 100 times brighter than one of magnitude 7.0. The brightest astronomical objects have negative apparent magnitudes: for example, Venus at −4.2 or Sirius at −1.46. The faintest stars visible with the naked eye on the darkest night have apparent magnitudes of about +6.5, though this varies depending on a person's eyesight and with altitude and atmospheric conditions. The apparent magnitudes of known objects range from the Sun at −26.7 to objects in deep Hubble Space Telescope images of magnitude +31.5. The measurement of apparent magnitude is called

   From the South Pole, in good visibility conditions, the Southern Sky features over 2,000 fixed stars that are easily visible to the naked eye, while about 20,000 to 40,000 with the aided eye. In large cities, about 300 to 500 stars can be seen depending on the extent of light and air pollution. The farther north, the fewer are visible to the observer. The brightest stars are all larger than the Sun. Sirius in the constellation of Canis Major has the brightest apparent magnitude of −1.46; it has a radius twice that of the Sun and is 8.6 light-years away. Canopus and the next fixed star Toliman (α Centauri), 4.2 light-years away, are also located in the Southern Sky, having declinations around −60°—too close to the south celestial pole that neither are visible from Central Europe.

The star is not just very small and far away, it also emits comparatively little visible light, mainly shining in the invisible infrared. Even from the close in proximity of TRAPPIST-1d, about 50 times closer than Earth is from the Sun, the planet receives less than 1% the visible light Earth sees from our Sun. This would probably make the days on TRAPPIST-1d never brighter than twilight is on Earth. However, that still means that TRAPPIST-1 could easily shine at least 3000 times brighter in the sky of TRAPPIST-1d than the full moon does in Earth's night sky.

  Orion's Belt or The Belt of Orion is an asterism within the constellation. It consists of the three bright stars Zeta (Alnitak), Epsilon (Alnilam), and Delta (Mintaka). Alnitak is around 800 light years away from earth and is 100,000 times more luminous than the Sun; much of its radiation is in the ultraviolet range, which the human eye cannot see. Alnilam is approximately 1340 light years away from Earth, shines with magnitude 1.70, and with ultraviolet light is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Mintaka is 915 light years away and shines with magnitude 2.21. It is 90,000 times more luminous than the Sun and is a double star: the two orbit each other every 5.73 days. In the Northern Hemisphere, Orion's Belt is best visible in the night sky during the month of January around 9:00 pm, when it is approximately around the local meridian. Just southwest of Alnitak lies Sigma Orionis, a multiple star system composed of five stars that have a combined apparent magnitude of 3.7 and lying 1150 light years distant. Southwest of Mintaka lies the quadruple star Eta Orionis.

 Simulated appearance of Haidinger's brush for vertically polarized light. Size and intensity exaggerated for clarity. Orientation varies with that of polarization of light source. Haidinger's brush, more commonly known as Haidinger's brushes is an image produced by the eye, an entoptic phenomenon, first described by Austrian physicist Wilhelm Karl von Haidinger in 1844. Haidinger saw it when he looked through various minerals that polarized light. Many people are able to perceive polarization of light. Haidinger's brushes may be seen as a yellowish horizontal bar or bow-tie shape (with "fuzzy" ends, hence the name "brush") visible in the center of the visual field against the blue sky viewed while facing away from the sun, or on any bright background. It typically occupies roughly 3–5 degrees of vision, about twice or three times the width of one's thumb held at arm's length. The direction of light polarization is perpendicular to the yellow bar (i.e., vertical if the bar is horizontal). Fainter bluish or purplish areas may be visible between the yellow brushes (see illustration). Haidinger's brush may also be seen by looking at a white area on many LCD flat panel computer screens (due to the polarization effect of the display), in which case it is often diagonal.

  The rise and fall of the oceans due to tidal effects is a key influence upon the coastal areas. Ocean tides on the planet Earth are created by the gravitational effects of the Sun and Moon. The tides produced by these two bodies are roughly comparable in magnitude, but the orbital motion of the Moon results in tidal patterns that vary over the course of a month. The ebb and flow of the tides produce a cyclical current along the coast, and the strength of this current can be quite dramatic along narrow estuaries. Incoming tides can also produce a tidal bore along a river or narrow bay as the water flow against the current results in

  deposited or produced by anaerobic reduction of iron oxides. The electron acceptor with the highest redox potential is oxygen. Produced by photosynthesis, it is transported to the ocean floor. There, it is quickly taken up if there is a lot of organic material, and may only be present in the top few centimeters. In organic-poor sediments it can be found at greater depths, even to the oceanic crust. Nitrate can be produced by degradation of organic matter or nitrogen fixation. Oxygen and nitrate are derived from photosynthesis, so underground communities that utilize them are not truly independent of the surface.

  paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.  Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are photo-voltaic cells that are organized into panels and concentrated solar power, which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an electrical generator via a steam turbine or heat engine, or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells. The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a direct current and has to be converted to alternating current before it can be used in a household. At this point,

  Energy for the ocean circulation (and for the atmospheric circulation) comes from solar radiation and gravitational energy from the sun and moon. The amount of sunlight absorbed at the surface varies strongly with latitude, being greater at the equator than at the poles, and this engenders fluid motion in both the atmosphere and ocean that acts to redistribute heat from the equator towards the poles, thereby reducing the temperature gradients that would exist in the absence of fluid motion. Perhaps three quarters of this heat is carried in the atmosphere; the rest is carried in the ocean. The atmosphere is heated from below, which leads to convection, the largest expression of which is the Hadley circulation. By contrast the ocean is heated from above, which tends to suppress convection. Instead ocean deep water is formed in polar regions where cold salty waters sink in

  Chemical oceanography is a broad and complex study of the metamorphosis that the chemicals within oceans, living marine organisms, and the ocean floor. The ocean contains a multitude of chemicals; some are natural, and others are man-made. These chemicals enter the sea in a number of ways. Rivers and streams bring freshwater into the ocean along the coastline. Freshwater inputs contain dissolved and particulate chemicals from natural weathering and human activities. Examples of this would be the weathering of rocks or soils, industrial sources like agriculture, power plants, or manufacturing facilities, and pollution from nearby towns and cities. Chemicals can also enter and leave the oceans through the via exchange at the air-water boundary. Substances like aerosols and pesticides may be deposited in this way. Other ways chemicals can enter the ocean are through ocean exploration, the shipping industry, and petroleum extraction. Some chemicals introduced to the ocean can be harmful to the ecosystems within it.

  Energy in the Faroe Islands is produced primarily from fossil fuels, with further contributions from hydro and wind power. Oil products are the main energy source, mainly consumed by fishing vessels and sea transport. Electricity is produced by oil, hydropower and wind farms, mainly by the SEV, which is owned by all the municipalities of the Faroe Islands. The Faroe Islands are not connected by power lines with continental Europe, and thus the archipelago cannot import or export electricity.

Terrestrial organic matter (mainly from plants) is typically harder to process than marine (phytoplankton). Some organisms break down organic compounds using fermentation and hydrolysis, making it possible for others to convert it back to carbon dioxide. Hydrogen is a good energy source, but competition tends to make it scarce. It is particularly rich in hydrothermal fluids where it is produced by serpentinization. Multiple species can combine fermentation with methanogenesis and iron oxidation with hydrogen consumption. Methane is mostly found in marine sediments, in gaseous form (dissolved

  have motile sperm that swim directly to the egg inside the ovule, whereas conifers and gnetophytes have sperm that are unable to swim but are conveyed to the egg along a pollen tube. The study of pollination spans many disciplines, such as botany, horticulture, entomology, and ecology. The pollination process as an interaction between flower and pollen vector was first addressed in the 18th century by Christian Konrad Sprengel. It is important in horticulture and agriculture, because fruiting is dependent on fertilization: the result of pollination. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology. There are also studies in economics that look at the positive and negative benefits of pollination, focused on bees, and how the process affects the pollinators themselves.

  Pollination is the transfer of pollen from an anther (male part) of a plant to the stigma (female part) of a plant, later enabling fertilisation and the production of seeds, most often by an animal or by wind. Pollinating agents are animals such as insects, birds, and bats; water; wind; and even plants themselves, when self-pollination occurs within a closed flower. Pollination often occurs within a species. When pollination occurs between species it can produce hybrid offspring in nature and in plant breeding work. In angiosperms, after the pollen grain (gametophyte) has landed on the stigma, it germinates and develops a pollen tube which grows down the style until it reaches an ovary. Its two gametes travel down the tube to where the

The undivided leaves are arranged alternately, and are 4 – long, ovate to round in shape, with very finely toothed margins. The upper side of the leaf is rough in texture but hairless; the lower side bears hairs. The yellow flowers are arranged in cymes and are sweetly scented. The petals of each flower are fused together to form a trumpet shape, 2 – across at the mouth, which has five to eight lobes. Inside the flower there are five to eight stamens. After fertilization, a globular white fruit (a drupe) forms, 8 – across, containing from one to four seeds.

The surviving one develops as a megaspore and divides repeatedly to form an immature female gametophyte (egg sac). Two or three archegonia containing an egg then develop inside the gametophyte. Meanwhile, in the spring of the second year two sperm cells are produced by mitosis of the body cell of the male gametophyte. The pollen tube elongates and pierces and grows through the megasporangium wall and delivers the sperm cells to the female gametophyte inside.

When a pollen grain lands close enough to the tip of an ovule, it is drawn in through the micropyle ( a pore in the integuments covering the tip of the ovule) often by means of a drop of liquid known as a pollination drop.

  containing the female gametes are held within the carpel. After entering an ovum cell through the micropyle, one male nucleus fuses with the polar bodies to produce the endosperm tissues, while the other fuses with the ovule to produce the embryo. Hence the term: "double fertilization". This process would result in the production of a seed made of both nutritious tissues and embryo. In gymnosperms, the ovule is not contained in a carpel, but exposed on the surface of a dedicated support organ, such as the scale of a cone, so that the penetration of carpel tissue is unnecessary. Details of the process vary according to the division of gymnosperms in question. Two main modes of fertilization are found in gymnosperms. Cycads and

  In mathematics, the magnitude or size of a mathematical object is a property which determines whether the object is larger or smaller than other objects of the same kind. More formally, an object's magnitude is the displayed result of an ordering (or ranking)—of the class of objects to which it belongs. In physics, magnitude can be defined as quantity or distance.

  If one looks at a one-centimeter object at a distance of one meter and a two-centimeter object at a distance of two meters, both subtend the same visual angle of about 0.01 rad or 0.57°. Thus they have the same retinal image size which determines the size of the retinal image.

  The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be equal or congruent or equal in measure. In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the orientation of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full turn are effectively equivalent. In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a spiral curve or describing the cumulative rotation of an object in

  In astronomy the term apparent size refers to the physical angle, the object's physical width or height or diameter. Widespread use of the ambiguous  terms "apparent size" and "perceived size" without specifying the units of  measure has caused confusion.

 An eye examination is a battery of tests performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist assessing vision and ability to focus on and discern objects, as well as other tests and examinations pertaining to the eyes. All people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine care by the primary care physician, especially since many eye diseases are silent or asymptomatic.
What does an Eye examination contain?
Ideally, the eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for visual acuity, pupil function, extraocular muscle motility, visual fields, intraocular pressure and ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil.
A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil.
External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the eyelids, surrounding tissues and palpebral fissure. Palpation of the orbital rim may also be desirable, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms. The conjunctiva and sclera can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid. The cornea and iris may be similarly inspected.
Visual acuity is the eye’s ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye’s ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance. The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc. The terms 20/20 and 6/6 are derived from standardized sized objects that can be seen by a “person of normal vision” at the specified distance. For example, if one can see at a distance of 20 ft an object that normally can be seen at 20 ft, then one has 20/20 vision. If one can see at 20 ft what a normal person can see at 40 ft, then one has 20/40 vision. Put another way, suppose you have trouble seeing objects at a distance and you can only see out to 20 ft what a person with normal vision can see out to 200 feet, then you have 20/200 vision. The 6/6 terminology is more commonly used in Europe, and represents distances in meters.
An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1 mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation. These steps can be easily remembered with the mnemonic PERRLA (D+C): Pupils Equal and Regular; Reactive to Light and Accommodation (Direct and Consensual).
A swinging-flashlight test may also be desirable if neurologic damage is suspected. The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a general physician for the assessment of optic nerve anomalies. This test detects the afferent pupil defect, also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil. In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to light. As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye.

  Assuming finitely many kinds only, the notion of similarity can be defined by that of kind: an object A is more similar to B than to C if A and B belong jointly to more kinds than A and C do. Vice versa, it remains again unclear how to define kind by similarity. Defining e.g. the kind of red things as the set of all things that are more similar to a fixed "paradigmatical" red object than this is to another fixed "foil" non-red object (cf. left picture) isn't satisfactory, since the degree of overall similarity, including e.g. shape, weight, will afford little

Harry the eagle has all the properties that we can attribute to an eagle, for example his parents were eagles, he is a bird, he is a meat eater and so on. It is a special kind of is a relationship.

 Accommodation; mechanism by which eye spontaneously adjusts to objects at different distances to achieve a clear image.
With correction; wearing prescribed lenses with glasses.
Counting fingers; low visual acuity; used in conjunction with distance. For example, CF at I foot - the individual can count fingers at a distance of one foot.
Extraocular muscles. A check to see if the individuals eye can move normally in different fields.
Esotropia; inward deviation of eye, towards nose.
Fluorescein angiogram; a dye test. Dye is injected into blood and a picture is taken of the retina.
Behind the lens. Examination of the eye to check what is behind the lens.
Hand motion (also known as hand movement); used in conjunction with distance. For example, HM at 1 foot means the individual can see hand movement at one foot.
Intraocular pressure; the pressure of aqueous humor within the eye.
Jaeger test; a test for near vision. Lines of reading matter printed in a series of various sizes of type.
Light perception; ability to distinguish light from dark.
Light projection; the ability to perceive and localize light.
Muscle balance; how eyes line up.
No light perception; inability to distinguish light from dark.
Both eyes together; oculi unitas.
Pupils; equally round and reactive to light. If optic nerve is damaged the pupils will not respond normally.
Perceives and localizes light in one or more quadrants.
Presbyopia; a gradual lessening of the power of accommodation due to a physiological change which affects eyes after the age of forty.
Without correction; not wearing glasses.
Visual acuity; the ability of the eye to perceive the shape of objects in the direct line of sight. Visual acuity is measured by viewing standardized letters of varying sizes and is expressed as a fraction such as 20/20.
Visual field; entire area which can be seen without moving the gaze, normally 180 degrees.
Exotropia; outward deviation of eye, away from nose.
Normal visual acuity; ability to correctly perceive an object or letter of a designated size from a distance of 20 feet.

  In mathematics, a degenerate case is a limiting case of a class of objects which appears to be qualitatively different from (and usually simpler than) the rest of the class, and the term degeneracy is the condition of being a degenerate case. The definitions of many classes of composite or structured objects often implicitly include inequalities. For example, the angles and the side lengths of a triangle are supposed to be positive. The limiting cases, where one or several of these inequalities become equalities, are degeneracies. In the case of triangles, one has a degenerate triangle if at least one

 Example: Given a simple system = { { ←, ↑, →, ↓ }, ∫ } for a very simple relationship between the objects as signified by the symbol ∫: Or, we might specify that ∫ represents 90-degree counter-clockwise rotations of a simple object →. Object theory is a theory in mathematical logic concerning objects and the statements that can be made about objects. In some cases "objects" can be concretely thought of as symbols and strings of symbols, here illustrated by a string of four symbols " ←←↑↓←→←↓" as composed from the 4-symbol alphabet { ←, ↑, →, ↓ }.

  The melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance (in liquid state) is the point where the vapour pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid and all the liquid changes state to gas. As a metal is heated to its melting point, the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around, and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metal's boiling point. Therefore, the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals

  Adiabatic cooling does not have to involve a fluid. One technique used to reach very low temperatures (thousandths and even millionths of a degree above absolute zero) is via adiabatic demagnetisation, where the change in magnetic field on a magnetic material is used to provide adiabatic cooling. Also, the contents of an expanding universe can be described (to first order) as an adiabatically cooling fluid. (See heat death of the universe.) Rising magma also undergoes adiabatic cooling before eruption, particularly significant in the case of magmas that rise quickly from great depths such as kimberlites. In the Earth's convecting mantle (the asthenosphere)

 What is Cold Water Extraction?
Cold water extraction, or shortly CWE is a physicochemical procedure in which a substance is extracted from a mixture through cold water. It is a type of fractional crystallization. This procedure is based on solubility differences of different substances in a low temperature mixture. CWE involves taking a combination of substances, dissolving them in warm water, and then rapidly cooling the mixture.
Insoluble compounds will precipitate out of the water, while the soluble ones stay dissolved. The solution can then be separated by decantation or filtration. It is commonly used to separate out opiate drugs that have been mixed with common non-opiate-based analgesics.
So, Opiates such as morphine, codeine, hydrocodone and oxycodone are much more soluble in cold water comparing to acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen so they will be dissolved, while acetaminophen, aspirin and ibuprofen will be precipitated.
Why is Cold Water Extraction performing?
Many opioid drugs combination such as Vicodin (hydrocodone), Lortab (Hydrocodone/paracetamol), Lorcet, Tylenol forte, Percocet etc., may be harmful for the patient. A cold water extraction is a procedure that is most commonly used to remove acetaminophen (paracetamol) from such combinations.
CWE also works fine with aspirin and to a slighter extent with ibuprofen, which may be all very toxic if they are taken in high doses together with opioid drugs and overdosed. Serious side effects may result in permanent liver damage.
Acetaminophen’s hepatotoxicity is one of the major causes of poisoning worldwide, and in the UK and US, it is one of the most common cause of acute liver failure. By performing cold water extraction acetaminophen and aspirin can be easily removed from prescription pills.
Manufacturers and health professionals generally recommended that adults with no issues may take no more than 4 grams of acetaminophen during a day, and not more than 1g APAP at once, however in some cases, and in predisposed patients, even the lower doses may cause liver damage. Cold water extraction is most commonly used with Hydrocodone/acetaminophen, Oxycodone/acetaminophen and Codeine/acetaminophen medications.
There is one exception of this rule. Many opioid/analgesic combinations also contain caffeine. Such products can be also used with the knowledge that the most of the caffeine dose will ended in the finished product. Most patients should not matter, however some patients with issues after taking caffeine have to be warned!
The main idea is that acetaminophen and aspirin are hardly soluble in water. However, most opioids are very soluble in water. Acetaminophen and Aspirin are soluble in methanol, ethanol, ethylene dichloride, dimethyl-formamide, acetone and ethyl acetate; slightly soluble in ether; very soluble in cold water, considerably more soluble in hot water.
Extraction works because the opioids will be dissolved into the cold water and leaves the APAP, aspirin, or ibuprofen behind. Also, the aspirin will be able to be caught in your filter.
If capsules are, you will not need to crush them, they only need to be opened and their content poured into water. Capsules are also much easier to dissolve. If you don’t have capsules, tablets/pills should be crushed before performing the CWE.
How to do a cold water extraction?
Crush your tablets into a fine powder. Try to minimize powder loss. If you have capsules, simply open them and pour the content.
Tip: Put tablets in a Ziplock bag. Use some object to crush all tablets into a fine powder without perforating the bag.
Fine powder should be dissolved into warm water. You should get hot water from your tap and it should not be too hot, because boiling water may destroy the opioid molecule. Put the water in a bowl or container that should be with a wide surface area, allowing the mixture to cool more quickly. Add the powder to about ½ or ¾ cup of water.
Tip: It is always better to have too much water than not to have enough.
Let the mixture cool to room temperature on for about 10-20 minutes. Stir it every few minutes until it is completely dissolved. Mixture should not be cooled to too quickly, because codeine may be destroyed within. Leave it sit on the counter for a period of time, until it is at or near room temperature.
Put the bowl or container with a mixture into the freezer to be cold enough. This is where magic happens. You do not need to put the lid on the container. You should leave it until it is extremely cold to the touch. However, do not let it freeze! This might take up to 20 or 25 minutes.
The next step is filtration. You can use for that filter paper, cheesecloth, coffee filter, or even aeropress. A handkerchief might also work well if you do not have mentioned stuff. Put the filter at the top of a cup and secure it with a tape. Pour slowly the mixture into the filtered cup. Do not pour in too much water and do not touch the filter, as you make break it and have to do filtering again.
When appears that filter is done with dripping into the cup and there is nothing left to be filtered, you will then get a dense, marshmallow-like substance. You can the squeeze the contents of the old filters via new filter to save any remaining moisture. You also add more water to the marshmallow mixture and re-filter it; nevertheless it isn’t necessary to do.
Drink your filtered mixture and throw away the acetaminophen/ibuprofen/aspirin. The most of these should have been successfully removed. The solution might be really bitter, so you can mix it with something sweet for better taste.

  the change of state to liquid, and then to solid; and the sum of the enthalpy of vaporization (gas to liquid) and enthalpy of fusion (liquid to solid) exceeds the ideal gas's change in enthalpy to absolute zero. In the quantum-mechanical description, matter (solid) at absolute zero is in its ground state, the point of lowest internal energy. The laws of thermodynamics indicate that absolute zero cannot be reached using only thermodynamic means, because the temperature of the substance being cooled approaches the temperature of the cooling agent asymptotically, and a system at absolute zero still possesses quantum mechanical zero-point energy, the energy of its ground state at absolute zero. The kinetic energy of the ground state cannot be removed. Scientists and technologists routinely achieve temperatures close to absolute zero, where matter exhibits quantum effects such as Bose–Einstein condensate, superconductivity and superfluidity.

  Drinks cooled with small ice cubes cool faster than drinks cooled with the same mass of larger ice cubes. The common explanation for this phenomenon is that smaller cubes have greater surface area, and this greater area causes greater heat conduction and therefore faster cooling. For a given volume of ice, the total surface area of the ice is proportional to so that the cooling time is proportional to the length scale of the ice cube squared, not just the length scale.

  One of the first to discuss the possibility of an absolute minimal temperature was Robert Boyle. His 1665 New Experiments and Observations touching Cold, articulated the dispute known as the primum frigidum. The concept was well known among naturalists of the time. Some contended an absolute minimum temperature occurred within earth (as one of the four classical elements), others within water, others air, and some more recently within nitre. But all of them seemed to agree that, "There is some body or other that is of its own nature supremely cold and by participation of which all other bodies obtain that quality."

 Accueil > Wellness information center > Why does my skin turn red after a minor burn or sunburn?
A sunburn is a burn caused by UVB rays. If it’s red and slightly painful, then it’s a first-degree burn. If it also has blisters, then it’s a second-degree burn. Yet another reason why you should use sunscreen.
When we think of a burn, we typically think of a fire, hot object, or scalding liquid. In medical terms, a burn is a skin lesion caused by contact with a hot, corrosive, or extremely cold object or substance or an electrical current. There are different severities or “degrees” of burns depending on the kind, size, and depth of the lesion.
Why is my skin red ?
When the skin is burned, your body responds immediately by increasing blood flow to the area. This makes the skin look red and feel warm to the touch. Your body also releases histamine, which triggers the inflammatory response behind the pain and warmth.
What should I do if I’ve been burned ?
– If you have a minor burn : Disinfect the area and dry it by dabbing gently with a towel. Then apply a soothing, healing balm and cover with a gauze bandage.
– If you have a sunburn : Apply an aloe vera-based lotion to the burned area to ease the inflammation—and stay out of the sun until it’s completely healed!
Many burn ointments have a greasy consistency. Don’t put them on your sunburn before going outdoors, unless you want to get “fried”!

For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

  eat them, and the elements move up the food chain. Larger organisms may also consume soil (geophagia) or use mineral resources, such as salt licks, to obtain limited minerals unavailable through other dietary sources. Bacteria and fungi play an essential role in the weathering of primary elements that results in the release of nutrients for their own nutrition and for the nutrition of other species in the ecological food chain. One element, cobalt, is available for use by animals only after having been processed into complex molecules (e.g., vitamin B12) by bacteria. Minerals are used by animals and microorganisms for the process of mineralizing structures, called biomineralization, used to construct bones, seashells, eggshells, exoskeletons and mollusc shells.

  Minerals can be bioengineered by bacteria which act on metals to catalyze mineral dissolution and precipitation. Mineral nutrients are recycled by bacteria distributed throughout soils, oceans, freshwater, groundwater, and glacier meltwater systems worldwide. Bacteria absorb dissolved organic matter containing minerals as they scavenge phytoplankton blooms. Mineral nutrients cycle through this marine food chain, from bacteria and phytoplankton to flagellates and zooplankton, which are then eaten by other marine life. In terrestrial ecosystems, fungi have similar roles as bacteria, mobilizing minerals from matter inaccessible by other organisms, then transporting the acquired nutrients to local ecosystems.

 Microorganisms play a crucial role in decomposing detritus in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Detritus refers to non-living organic material such as dead organisms, fragments of organisms, or fecal material. When detritus is present, it becomes colonized by communities of microorganisms that initiate the process of decomposition.

In terrestrial ecosystems, detritus can be found on the soil surface or intermixed with soil. Microorganisms like bacteria and fungi break down this organic matter into simpler compounds through a process called decomposition or remineralization. These microorganisms secrete enzymes that help break down complex molecules into smaller ones, which are then absorbed by other organisms or further broken down into inorganic nutrients that can be used by plants.

Similarly, in aquatic ecosystems, detritus refers to organic material suspended in water. Along with plankton, detritus forms an important part of seston (suspended materials) and may accumulate at the base of a water column. Microorganisms present in water bodies play a vital role in breaking down this detritus through similar processes of decomposition.

The decomposition of detritus by microorganisms is essential for nutrient cycling in ecosystems. As microorganisms break down organic matter, they release nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals back into the environment. These nutrients are then available for uptake by plants and other organisms, contributing to the overall productivity and functioning of the ecosystem.

Overall, microorganisms are key players in decomposing detritus in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Their activities contribute to nutrient recycling and energy flow within these ecosystems, supporting the growth and survival of various organisms within them.

Reference:
- In biology, detritus is non-living particulate organic material (as opposed to dissolved organic material). It typically includes the bodies of dead organisms or fragments of organisms or fecal material.
- Detritus is normally colonized by communities of microorganisms which act to decompose (or remineralize) the material.
- In terrestrial ecosystems, the term refers to litter on the soil surface as well as organic matter intermixed with soil.
- In aquatic ecosystems, the term refers to organic material found suspended in water. Together with plankton, detritus is an important constituent of seston (materials in suspension), and may also accumulate at the base of a water column.

 According to Casper's dictum, decomposition is known to occur most rapidly in soil environments. Soil acts as a natural medium where organic materials can break down more quickly due to various factors such as microbial activity, moisture, temperature, and the presence of decomposers like bacteria, fungi, insects, and earthworms. These decomposers play a vital role in breaking down complex organic matter such as dead plant materials, animal carcasses, and other organic waste. In soil environments, the decomposition process is facilitated by the efficient nutrient cycling, aeration, and the presence of a diverse range of decomposers. As a result, the organic matter is broken down into simpler compounds, effectively recycling nutrients back into the soil and promoting a healthy ecosystem. So, based on Casper's dictum, it can be concluded that decomposition occurs at its fastest rate in soil environments.

 The purpose of using Azolla pinnata, Aspergillus terreus, and Eisenia fetida in the recycling of surplus wheat straw and cattle dung is to facilitate faster recycling of nutrients from these organic materials. The mentioned study investigated the use of these organisms in the vermicomposting and aerobic composting of wheat straw spiked with cattle dung. 

Azolla pinnata plays a role in enhancing the conversion of wheat straw into a nutrient-rich product that can be used in agriculture. It aids in the decomposition and breakdown of the wheat straw, allowing for the release of essential nutrients for plants. Additionally, Azolla pinnata helps reduce the amount of cattle dung required in the mixture, thereby enabling farmers to handle a smaller bulk of organic waste.

Aspergillus terreus is a type of fungus that contributes to the degradation and decomposition of organic materials. In the mentioned study, its presence in the wheat straw and cattle dung mixture likely promoted the breakdown of these materials and facilitated the release of nutrients during the composting process.

Eisenia fetida, also known as red worms or red wigglers, are commonly used in vermicomposting due to their ability to rapidly consume and break down organic matter. They enhance the decomposition process and produce nutrient-rich castings (worm waste) that can be used as a natural fertilizer.

By utilizing Azolla pinnata, Aspergillus terreus, and Eisenia fetida in the recycling process, the study found that the time required for degradation of the wheat straw and cattle dung mixtures was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the resulting products had improved nutrient profiles, making them suitable for agronomic use.

Overall, the purpose of incorporating these organisms in the recycling of surplus wheat straw and cattle dung is to promote the efficient decomposition of organic materials, accelerate nutrient release, improve nutrient quality, and provide an alternative to burning, contributing to sustainable waste management practices.

This material is chewed up and semi-digested by the termites, fertilised with their faeces and placed in the chambers where it is quickly colonised by the fungus to form a "fungus comb". The termites cultivate these fungus gardens, adding more substrate as required, and removing the older parts of the comb for consumption by all members of the colony. In addition, some species feed on various types of living and dead plant material including wood, but not on decomposing vegetation; these termites have a similar microbial gut flora to other species of termite.

  Saprotrophic bacteria are bacteria that are typically soil-dwelling and utilize saprotrophic nutrition as their primary energy source. They act as important decomposers, connecting the foundation of the food web, but they can also tie up nutrients in an ecosystem, leaving them as an ecologically limiting factor. Saprotrophic bacteria are often associated with soil fungi that also use saprotrophic nutrition and both are classified as saprotrophs. Some saprotrophic bacteria may be vectors for food borne illnesses such as Escherichia coli. They are common pathogens in medicine and agriculture, as they move readily between individuals via consumption or other modes of exposure, such as contact with excrement. When cultivating

  activated in the light (which is why the name "dark reaction" is misleading), and also by products of the light-dependent reaction. These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide. Energy (in the form of ATP) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net productivity. The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following: Hexose (six-carbon) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle. Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as, this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration, where six-carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria. The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three-carbon sugar phosphate molecules, or "triose phosphates", namely, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).

  In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (Azolla), angiosperms (Gunnera), etc. There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is no direct reaction that converts to a sugar because all

Atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by leaves in the process of photosynthesis, where is used to generate sugars in a molecular pathway known as the Calvin cycle. This draw-down of induces more atmospheric  to diffuse through stomata into the air spaces of the leaf. While stoma are open, water vapor can easily diffuse out of plant tissues, a process known as transpiration. It is this exchange of and water vapor that is measured as a proxy of photosynthetic rate.

  a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago. The main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.  Timeline of Photosynthesis on Earth

  Plants use carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it. Plant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion.

  Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation. Research on this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight.

In land plants, leaves absorb mostly red and blue light in the first layer of photosynthetic cells because of Chlorophyll absorbance. Green light, however, penetrates deeper into the leaf interior and can drive photosynthesis more efficiently than red light. Because green and yellow wavelengths can transmit through chlorophyll and the entire leaf itself, they play a crucial role in growth beneath the plant canopy.

 Chloroplasts play a crucial role in the survival of eukaryotic cells. They are believed to have originated from symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria that were acquired by eukaryotic cells possessing mitochondria. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome and perform photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is the process by which chloroplasts use the energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. This process converts light energy into chemical energy stored in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. The carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis serve as a source of energy and organic compounds for the host eukaryotic cell.

The products of photosynthesis, including glucose and oxygen, are delivered to the host cell as food. Glucose serves as a vital energy source for cellular processes, providing the necessary fuel for various metabolic reactions. Oxygen, on the other hand, is released into the surrounding environment, supporting aerobic respiration in other organisms.

The presence of chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells, particularly in plants and algae, enables these organisms to generate their own food through photosynthesis. This ability to produce energy-rich carbohydrates gives them a significant advantage in terms of survival and growth. Furthermore, the partnership between eukaryotic cells and chloroplasts is believed to have evolved around 1.5 billion years ago when the Earth's atmosphere became rich in oxygen.

In summary, chloroplasts contribute to the survival of eukaryotic cells by performing photosynthesis, synthesizing carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight energy. The products of photosynthesis, such as glucose and oxygen, provide nourishment and energy for the host cell, enabling it to carry out essential cellular processes and ensuring the organism's survival.

 1 -0.11881  Plants use carbon dioxide gas in the process of photosynthesis, and exhale oxygen gas as waste. The chemical equation of photosynthesis is 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) and 6 H2O (water), which in the presence of sunlight makes C6H12O6 (glucose) and 6 O2 (oxygen). Photosynthesis uses electrons on the carbon atoms as the repository for the energy obtained from sunlight. Respiration is the opposite of photosynthesis. It reclaims the energy to power chemical reactions in cells. In so doing the carbon atoms and their electrons are combined with oxygen forming CO2 which is easily removed from both the cells and the organism. Plants use both processes, photosynthesis to capture the energy and oxidative metabolism to use it. Plant respiration is limited by the process of diffusion. 
 2 -0.15616  Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation. Research on this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight.

 4 -0.26731  Photosynthesis systems function by measuring gas exchange of leaves. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by leaves in the process of photosynthesis, where is used to generate sugars in a molecular pathway known as the Calvin cycle. This draw-down of induces more atmospheric  to diffuse through stomata into the air spaces of the leaf. While stoma are open, water vapor can easily diffuse out of plant tissues, a process known as transpiration. It is this exchange of and water vapor that is measured as a proxy of photosynthetic rate. The basic components of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), batteries and 
 5 -0.27509  In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (Azolla), angiosperms (Gunnera), etc. There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).

 Magnolia Rehabilitation offers mild hyperbaric oxygen therapy at all three of our locations in Columbus, Starkville, and West Point.
Mild Hyperbaric Therapy, also known as HBT is a safe method of delivering increased oxygen to the body at the cellular level. It provides an optimal environment for the body to carry out vital cell processes thereby increasing the effectiveness of the body to heal itself. HBT utilizes filtered pressurized ambient air to dissolve oxygen directly into the plasma, cerebral and spinal fluids, flooding tissues and vital organs with oxygen. Mild hyperbaric therapy allows for healing at the cellular level, which is critical for changes to occur which in turn allows healthy tissue formation that provides the possibility for healthier organs thus resulting in an overall healthier body.
HBT uses filtered ambient air, so there is no risk of oxygen toxicity to the body even with regular use. The chamber can be depressurized and opened from the inside. Once inside the chamber, both visual and verbal communication is possible with a buzzer for assistance or help. Most people report a comfortable, relaxing experience and emerge from the chamber feeling refreshed. HBT is non-invasive, non-pharmaceutical; therefore there are no dangerous side effects.
The mild hyperbaric chamber is filled with compressed ambient air from 2 to 4.5 pounds per square inch. (1.3 ATA max). This is the equivalent to 11 feet below sea level.
The increased pressure allows the blood plasma and other liquids of the body to absorb additional oxygen thus increasing oxygen uptake by the cells, tissues, glands, organs, brain and fluids of the body. This resulting uptake of oxygen allows for increased circulation to areas with inflammation and swelling.
Oxygen is then utilized by the body for vital cell functions and healthier cells equal healthier tissues and organs. The human body can be capable of healing itself when it has what it needs and there is nothing more beneficial to the body than oxygen.
Henry’s Law of Physics states that: An increase in atmospheric pressure allows for more gas to be dissolved into any liquid.
Oxygen, which is the 8th element on the Periodic Table, exists as a gas at room temperature.
The Human Body is composed mostly of water. Gas…..under pressure…..dissolves in water.
Some people experience a mild discomfort in their ears when pressurizing the chamber, not unlike an experience when ascending in an airplane upon take off.
Some people following their first few sessions experience slight fatigue as the body sweeps itself clear of toxic debris that has built up in the body. This is completely safe and necessary.
It is advisable to wear comfortable loose fitting clothing. (Pantyhose, spanx, and other tight fitting garments can trigger feelings of claustrophobia.) Bring something to read, favorite music cd, portable DVD player, portable game, etc., as the sessions last from 30-60 minutes.
Do not drink large amounts of fluids before entering the chamber.
Do not wear perfume or cologne when you are coming for your session.
What can I expect to happen during my session?
The chamber will seem much smaller when it is deflated than when it is fully pressurized. Within 1 minute, the chamber will inflate completely, allowing enough room for an adult to sit upright or lie down fully extended.
Close your mouth and firmly clamp your nose shut with your fingers and thumb. Blow as if you were blowing your nose but keep your mouth closed and your nose clamped. You will feel the air come out through your ears when you have done this correctly, and this should relieve the pressure.
If you are a parent of a small child who is having trouble or discomfort with their ears during pressurization, try massaging the area just below the ears and directly behind the jaw. A baby that is still taking a bottle or pacifier can be given either of these, but please keep in mind the necessity to keep drinks from spilling inside the chamber.
The sessions last from 30 minutes to 60 minutes.
Are there any reasons a person should NOT go into the chamber?
Yes. You should not go into the chamber if you are inebriated (drunk), if you have ear canal problems or an ear infection or if you are experiencing flu or cold symptoms. It is also important that you do not enter the chamber if you are wearing perfume or cologne due to people who may enter the chamber after you that may be sensitive to chemicals.
How frequently should I schedule my sessions?
We will make recommendations for you through your doctor based on your initial evaluation by the physical therapist.
Sessions will vary in cost depending on the time spent in the chamber. Please contact the clinic for more specific information.

  There are two principal ways of formulating thermodynamics, (a) through passages from one state of thermodynamic equilibrium to another, and (b) through cyclic processes, by which the system is left unchanged, while the total entropy of the surroundings is increased. These two ways help to understand the processes of life. The thermodynamics of living organisms has been considered by many authors, such as Erwin Schrödinger, Léon Brillouin and Isaac Asimov. To a fair approximation, living organisms may be considered as examples of (b). Approximately, an animal's physical state cycles by the day, leaving the animal nearly unchanged. Animals take in food, water, and oxygen, and, as a result of metabolism, give out breakdown products and heat. Plants take in radiative energy from the sun, which may be regarded as heat,

  different foods will have varying levels of each of these three sugars. The sugar contents of common fruits and vegetables are presented in Table 1. In general, in foods that contain free fructose, the ratio of fructose to glucose is approximately 1:1; that is, foods with fructose usually contain about an equal amount of free glucose. A value that is above 1 indicates a higher proportion of fructose to glucose, and below 1 a lower proportion. Some fruits have larger proportions of fructose to glucose compared to others. For example, apples and pears contain more than twice as much free fructose as glucose, while for apricots the proportion is less than half as much fructose as glucose. Apple and pear juices are of

  Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a ketonic simple sugar found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into blood during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name "fructose" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Allen Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid, and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables. Commercially,

  carbon dioxide and water. They give out oxygen. In this way they grow. Eventually they die, and their remains rot away, turning mostly back into carbon dioxide and water. This can be regarded as a cyclic process. Overall, the sunlight is from a high temperature source, the sun, and its energy is passed to a lower temperature sink, i.e. radiated into space. This is an increase of entropy of the surroundings of the plant. Thus animals and plants obey the second law of thermodynamics, considered in terms of cyclic processes. Furthermore, the ability of living organisms to grow and increase in complexity, as well as to form correlations with their environment in the form of adaption and memory, is not opposed to the second law – rather, it is akin

  a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies, reported in March 2018, also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago. The main source of oxygen in the atmosphere is oxygenic photosynthesis, and its first appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around 2 billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic. Oxygenic photosynthesis uses water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.  Timeline of Photosynthesis on Earth

  Plant nutrients consist of more than a dozen minerals absorbed through roots, plus carbon dioxide and oxygen absorbed or released through leaves. All organisms obtain all their nutrients from the surrounding environment. Plants absorb carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from air and soil in the form of carbon dioxide and water. Other nutrients are absorbed from soil (exceptions include some parasitic or carnivorous plants). Counting these, there are 17 important nutrients for plants: these are macronutrients; nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sulfur (S), magnesium (Mg), carbon (C), oxygen(O) and hydrogen (H), and the micronutrients; iron (Fe), boron (B), chlorine (Cl), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), molybdenum (Mo) and nickel (Ni). In addition to carbon, hydrogen and oxygen; nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur are also needed in relatively large quantities. Together, the "Big Six" are the elemental macronutrients for all organisms. They are sourced from inorganic matter (for example, carbon dioxide, water, nitrates, phosphates, sulfates, and diatomic molecules of nitrogen and, especially, oxygen) and organic matter (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins).

  In nature, sucrose is present in many plants, and in particular their roots, fruits and nectars, because it serves as a way to store energy, primarily from photosynthesis. Many mammals, birds, insects and bacteria accumulate and feed on the sucrose in plants and for some it is their main food source. Although honeybees consume sucrose, the honey they produce consists primarily of fructose and glucose, with only trace amounts of sucrose. As fruits ripen, their sucrose content usually rises sharply, but some fruits contain almost no sucrose at all. This includes grapes, cherries, blueberries, blackberries, figs, pomegranates, tomatoes, avocados, lemons and limes. Sucrose is a naturally occurring sugar, but with the advent of industrialization, it has been increasingly refined and consumed in all kinds of processed foods.

  The biosynthesis of sucrose proceeds via the precursors UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme sucrose-6-phosphate synthase. The energy for the reaction is gained by the cleavage of uridine diphosphate (UDP). Sucrose is formed by plants, algae and cyanobacteria but not by other organisms. Sucrose is the end product of photosynthesis and is found naturally in many food plants along with the monosaccharide fructose. In many fruits, such as pineapple and apricot, sucrose is the main sugar. In others, such as grapes and pears, fructose is the main sugar.

 ** copper overload

**C.** globin overload

**D.** increased blood viscosity

**E.** iron overload

**Answer E:** Iron is primarily absorbed from the diet, in the duodenum, as either organic or heme-bound forms.** cardiac arrhythmias

**B.**A.What is the most serious complication of transfusion therapy?Therapy for severe anemia involves multiple transfusions.The resulting increase in H+ inside the erythrocyte in the capillaries of the tissues reduces oxygen-binding affinity and the hemoglobin thus releases the bound oxygen to the tissues. **10. ** The "Bohr effect" is best described by which of the following statements? **A. ** binding of O2

**B. ** covalent attachment of CO2 forming hemoglobin carbamate

**C.** release of O2 from hemoglobin in response to the buffering of Cl− by hemoglobin

**D.** release of CO2 from erythrocytes when they enter the high O2 concentration of the alveoli

**E.** release of O2 from hemoglobin in response to the buffering of H+ by hemoglobin

**Answer E:** The Bohr effect is the physiological phenomenon, first described by Christian Bohr, describing that the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is inversely related both to acidity and to the concentration of CO2. A decrease in blood pH or an increase in blood CO2 concentration will result in hemoglobin proteins releasing their oxygen and a decrease in carbon dioxide or increase in pH will result in hemoglobin picking up more oxygen. Since carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, an increase in CO2 results in a decrease in blood pH. **11. ** Beta-thalassemias are genetic disorders in the synthesis of the β-globin chains in hemoglobin. Affected individuals usually begin to exhibit some degree of anemia at about 6 months of age. Therapy for severe anemia involves multiple transfusions. What is the most serious complication of transfusion therapy? **A. ** cardiac arrhythmias

**B. ** copper overload

**C.** globin overload

**D.** increased blood viscosity

**E.** iron overload

**Answer E:** Iron is primarily absorbed from the diet, in the duodenum, as either organic or heme-bound forms.Depending on total body iron stores, the iron is either transferred to the plasma, where it binds to plasma transferrin, or it remains in the enterocyte until it is lost with cell shedding.Once absorbed, iron is avidly retained by the body.

 A broken, cracked, or chipped front tooth is commonly caused by an unanticipated encounter with something hard, such as a chicken bone. Or, being bumped while drinking from a bottle. Or, a bad fall on the street, etc.
Dental mishaps of this nature can create a cosmetic crisis and quite possibly a very sensitive, if not outright painful, situation that leads to the dreaded emergency dental visit. At my office we handle a broken or chipped front tooth with a similar sense of scheduling priority as a toothache – namely, we try to get you in as soon as you can get here.
Sudden damage to a front tooth tends to create a greater sense of urgency than say, a chipped back tooth. Even a relatively small chip in your front tooth can lead to an outsized sense of panic. After all, your smile is front and center for the world to see. And, to your tongue and lips, the jagged gap is a tremendous inconvenience.
The remedy for a chipped front tooth can be a simple, elegant bonding procedure, porcelain veneer, a ceramic crown, or more involved treatment such as root canal. Sometimes a tooth replacement with a dental implant is required, depending on how severe is the chip, fracture, or break.
However, it is not damage to a front tooth resultant of a sudden mishap that I devote this treatise to, but rather to the more gradual deterioration, wear, chipping, and cracking that occurs because of bruxism.
Bruxism is what’s referred to as a parafunctional habit. Unlike eating, talking or swallowing, bruxism itself has no functional purpose. But, it causes systematic rubbing of the upper and lower teeth together with varying degrees of force during the night (nocturnal bruxism) or during the day (awake bruxism).
Accelerated wear – on the biting surfaces of your teeth.
Dental abfractions – notches along the gum line that look like someone took a mini-hatchet to the base of your tooth as if it were a tree trunk.
Sensitive teeth – when tooth enamel wears so thin that the sensitive dentin underneath becomes exposed.
Loose teeth – very common amongst bruxers.
Sore jaw muscles – some bruxers can generate forces in excess of 500 lbs. per square inch – more than enough power to wreak severe damage over time.
Enlarged jaw – your jaw muscles are like any other muscle in your body; the more you use it, the more developed, larger and stronger it can become and actually change the shape of your jaw.
Now back to the original premise of this discourse. Besides a sudden encounter of the hard kind, the leading cause of a cracked, broken, or chipped front tooth is bruxism. Minor chipping that occurs over a long period of time can result in your teeth getting shorter.
Enamel is the hardest substance in your body, but the tooth structure underneath it is soft. When your teeth grind and gnash against each other continuously over an extended period with an increasingly stronger force, enamel become thinner and thinner. Once the tooth enamel is worn through, wear accelerates even faster. Acidic foods make the situation even worse because they demineralize and further soften the tooth.
Imagine what would happen if you rubbed two large, pieces of chalk together. Chalkdust sprinkles and the chalk pieces gradually get thinner and thinner. Little pieces chip off or even an entire section breaks apart. Attrition is the technical term for the wear that occurs when two like and kind materials abrade away each other. This is what happens to your teeth over time when you have untreated bruxism.
As wear continues, the incisal edges of your front teeth (upper and lower) become irregular in shape and rougher. As your teeth glide against each other, such irregularities in structure make them vulnerable to literally “catching an edge,” which causes the enamel to chip. Usually, the chip is located at a corner of the tooth, but sometimes an entire piece of enamel cleaves off.
Many people who brux are not aware they have the problem until symptoms appear. It can go undetected for years because the wear is subtle and happens over a long period of time.
An effective way to demonstrate this phenomenon to the unknowing bruxer is to demonstrate how the chips in their upper front teeth fit into the irregularities and chips in their lower teeth like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. The precise matching of tooth wear patterns reflect the pathway of the lower teeth against the upper teeth as they machine each other over time.
I’ve seen many patients whose bed partner told them about an awful grating sound that emanates from their mouth while they’re asleep. That’s the sound of enamel scouring enamel.
As bruxism continues over time your back teeth can be affected, as well. Chipping and pitting (the development of shallow craters on chewing surfaces) will occur. As the tooth becomes thinner and the nerve gets closer to the surface, back teeth begin to fracture and become more sensitive.
Sadly, we do not yet have a miracle cure for bruxism. But we do have numerous ways to treat it. Your dentist may recommend braces or remove an “offending” tooth. Botox injections can decrease the force of your jaw muscles. Biofeedback, meditation, and at-home exercises have been found to have a positive impact for some people.
If you have a distinct chipped front tooth, if you have irregular edges and they feel flatter or sharper to your tongue than they once did, or if they look shorter, there’s a pretty good chance you have bruxism. Please see your dentist right away or discuss it at your next dental check-up (you do have an appointment, right?).

  Albert Frederick Schoenhut (1849-1912) created the A. Schoenhut Company, one of the leading toy producers in America at the turn of the twentieth century. In 1872, he founded the Schoenhut Piano Company in Philadelphia, which later became known as the A. Schoenhut Company and was incorporated in 1897. They established a reputation, based on German handicraft traditions, and created toy pianos and other musical instruments in the early days. Eventually, they introduced dolls, play sets, games and more and they became the largest toy manufacturer in America. In 1919, Schoenhut patented his “All-Wood Perfection Art Doll” and in 1997, the United States Postal Service issued stamps of Classic American Dolls and included his wooden dolls as part of the collection.

 Crepitus in bones is created when two rough surfaces within the body come into contact and grind against each other. For example, in conditions like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis, when the cartilage around joints erodes, the surfaces in the joint start rubbing together, producing the grating or crackling sounds and sensations of crepitus. Similarly, when two fractured surfaces of broken bones rub against each other, crepitus can also occur. This is why crepitus is a common sign of bone fracture. 

The process of creating crepitus can also be observed by exerting a small amount of force on a joint, causing bubbles of nitrogen to form in the synovial fluid and burst, resulting in a cracking sound. Almost every joint in the body can be 'cracked' in this way, with joints like the hallux, knuckles, and neck joints requiring the least effort to produce crepitus.

Additionally, crepitus can be created in soft tissues when gas is introduced into an area where it is not normally present. This can occur due to various reasons, such as gas gangrene caused by anaerobic infection or the presence of small, loose fibrinous particles in the fluid of a bursa.

It's important to note that crepitus can also be heard in lung conditions such as interstitial lung disease, which are referred to as "rales." In such cases, a stethoscope may be needed to detect the crepitus caused by respiratory diseases.

Overall, crepitus in bones is a result of rough surfaces in the body coming into contact and rubbing against each other, either due to joint pathologies or fractures. Furthermore, the introduction of gas in soft tissues can also lead to crepitus.

  Both under-watering and over-watering can be detrimental to a houseplant. Different species of houseplants require different soil moisture levels. Brown crispy tips on a plant's leaves are a sign that the plant is under-watered. Yellowing leaves can show that the plant is over watered. Most plants can not withstand their roots sitting in water and will often lead to root rot. Most species of houseplant will tolerate low humidity environments if they're watered regularly. Different plants require different amounts of light, for different durations. Houseplants are generally grown in specialized soils called potting compost or potting soil. A good potting compost mixture includes soil conditioners to provide the plant with nutrients, support, adequate drainage, and proper aeration. Most potting composts contain a combination of peat and vermiculite or perlite. Plants require soil minerals, mainly nitrate, phosphate, and potassium. Houseplants do not have a continuous feed of nutrients

  changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the microbiota mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

  water and air into the soil. A well aerated soil is important for plant and microbial health. Without access to oxygen, plant roots and aerobic microorganisms are unable to respire, and can die. To have a high biodiversity of soil organisms it is important to have a mix of different pore sizes and habitats in the soil (Trivedi, 2018 ). Soil pores create space in the soil that allows for root penetrability. In a compacted soil with few aggregates and limited pore spaces, roots have difficulty growing and may be excluded from nutrients and water stored in different parts of the soil. Soils with good aggregate stability typically have a higher water infiltration rate, allowing more water into the soil profile faster, and are not susceptible to water ponding.

 E.** Transformation is the process that describes the absorption of DNA by bacteria that is subsequently expressed.**99.Another explanation could be that the untreated bacteria or the agar plate on which they were growing were contaminated with bacteria from the treated-bacteria batch.Antibiotic resistance in untreated bacteria may have been acquired by mutation.That is, the expected and observed results don't differ at all. In contrast, if there were a 0% chance that the difference between expected and observed data could be explained by chance, then the data can only be explained by some variable in the experiment and that the hypothesis is incorrect (and must be rejected). If this were the case, any of the answer choices C, D, or E, or some other explanation, could explain the results. **93. D.** RuBP carboxylase fixes O2 as well as CO2. The Calvin cycle occurs when CO2 is combined with RuBP. When O2 combines with RuBP, photorespiration occurs. As O2 concentration increases, more O2 and less CO2 is fixed. **94. E.** A CO2 uptake of less than zero means that CO2 is being released. This occurs when the CO2 concentration is so low that photosynthesis cannot be supported and cellular respiration begins. **95. C.** Comparing plates I and II indicates that both kinds of bacteria can grow on regular agar (with no tetracycline). **96. A. ** Comparing plates III and IV indicates that normal bacteria die in the presence of tetracycline but that at least some of the treated bacteria survive. This shows that the treated bacteria have successfully absorbed the plasmid and have expressed the plasmid gene for antibiotic resistance. **97. D.** Not all of the treated bacteria were successfully transformed. Some of the bacteria did not absorb the plasmid while others may have absorbed the plasmid but were unable to express the antibiotic-resistant gene. **98. B. ** Some of the bacteria among the untreated bacteria are resistant to tetracycline. Antibiotic resistance in untreated bacteria may have been acquired by mutation. Another explanation could be that the untreated bacteria or the agar plate on which they were growing were contaminated with bacteria from the treated-bacteria batch. **99. E.** Transformation is the process that describes the absorption of DNA by bacteria that is subsequently expressed.**100.B.** A vector, or cloning vector, is a DNA molecule into which DNA has been inserted.The vector is subsequently used to carry the new, recombinant DNA into an organism.In this experiment, the vector is a plasmid.Phage vectors are also used.

 Diversification of agricultural products, such as fuelwood, medicinal plants, and multiple crops, increases income security ; Increased food security and nutrition by restored soil fertility, crop diversity and resilience to weather shocks for food crops ; Land restoration through reducing soil erosion and regulating water availability ; Multifunctional site use, e.g., crop production and animal grazing ; Reduced deforestation and pressure on woodlands by providing farm-grown fuelwood ; Possibility of reduced chemicals inputs, e.g. due to improved use of fertiliser, increased resilience against pests ,and increased ground cover which reduces weeds ; Growing space for medicinal plants e.g., in situations where people have limited access to mainstream medicines Agroforestry systems can provide a number of ecosystem services which can contribute to sustainable agriculture in the following ways; According to FAO's The State of the World’s Forests 2020, adopting agroforestry and sustainable production practices, restoring the productivity of degraded agricultural lands, embracing healthier diets and reducing food loss and waste are all actions that urgently need to be scaled up. Agribusinesses must meet their commitments to deforestation-free commodity chains and companies that have not made zero-deforestation commitments should do so.

The chains that are used on these guide bars are normally modified by reducing the length of the teeth in order that they are able to cut efficiently at the tip of the bar. The reason for this modification is that all chains manufactured currently (circa 2007) are made to be used on standard guide bars only. These "carving bars" are manufactured by "Cannon", "GB", and by a companies in Japan supplying "Stihl" and others. The other very important advantage with these guide bars is that they do not "kickback" when using the

When invented, the designer Ron Hickman had difficulty convincing anyone to market the Workmate, and sold them himself at trade shows. He had his first breakthrough in 1968, after convincing a DIY magazine to let him exhibit at the Ideal Home Exhibition in London, which enabled him to sell 1,800 units that year.

  MKII version of the Workmate went into production. When released, it was first sold in the United Kingdom for £24.95. Black & Decker had trouble keeping up with demand for the Workmate in the UK, but was still unconvinced of how well the Workmate would be accepted in the United States. As a test of demand, the UK-manufactured Workmate WM325 was introduced to the United States market in 1974 as the Model 79-001 Type E ("E" for England). U.S. consumers snapped them up, and Black & Decker began building Workmates for the North American market at their factory in Brockville, Ontario, Canada.

It is a folding table for portability, but when expanded stands about 3 ft tall. The table top consists of two wooden jaws, one of which is fixed and the other able to be moved in and out on threaded rods operated by handles, so it can be used as a bench vice to hold wood, metal and other parts while working on them.

  George I took over the mill and had it turned into a silver hammer mill. But this mill only worked for two years and was then closed. It was not worth turning it back into an iron hammer mill, so the prince-elector sold it in 1629 to a scissorsmith. Even its new owner did not have the luck to make it an economic success, the turmoil of war forcing him to give the operation up in 1631. From 1632, the place was used as a copper hammer mill, until its new owner left the business in 1642 probably due to the hardships of the Thirty Years'

In 1927, Emil Lerp, the founder of Dolmar, developed the world's first gasoline-powered chainsaw and mass produced them. World War II interrupted the supply of German chain saws to North America, so new manufacturers sprang up, including Industrial Engineering Ltd (IEL) in 1939, the forerunner of Pioneer Saws Ltd and part of Outboard Marine Corporation, the oldest manufacturer of chainsaws in North America.

Types E, and 1 through 5 used a pair of cast-aluminum pivoting H-frames to support the vise jaws and to allow the Workmate to fold for storage. The aluminum H-frame gave the Workmate a very distinctive appearance and was considered to be "Hickman's greatest aesthetic stroke." By the Type 6, the aluminum H-frames were gone, replaced by ones of stamped steel. They have since sold thirty million Workmates. Ron Hickman received a royalty of about 50 pence (£0.50, sterling) for each Workmate sold, and became a wealthy man.

These "carving bars" are manufactured by "Cannon", "GB", and by a companies in Japan supplying "Stihl" and others.

Types E, and 1 through 5 used a pair of cast-aluminum pivoting H-frames to support the vise jaws and to allow the Workmate to fold for storage. The aluminum H-frame gave the Workmate a very distinctive appearance and was considered to be "Hickman's greatest aesthetic stroke." By the Type 6, the aluminum H-frames were gone, replaced by ones of stamped steel. They have since sold thirty million Workmates. Ron Hickman received a royalty of about 50 pence (£0.50, sterling) for each Workmate sold, and became a wealthy man.

  the fixed stars and determining how much of the sky is visible. For example, New York City is about 40° north of the equator. The apparent motion of the Sun blots out slightly different parts of the sky from day to day, but over the course of the entire year it sees a dome of 280° (360° - 80°). So for example, both Orion and the Big Dipper are visible during at least part of the year. Making stellar observations from a representative set of points across Earth, combined with knowing the shortest on-the-ground distance between any two given points, makes an approximate sphere the only possible shape for Earth.

  The main source of information about celestial bodies and other objects is visible light, or more generally electromagnetic radiation. Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made. Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere. Specific information on these subfields is given below.

  The fixed stars can be demonstrated to be very far away by diurnal parallax measurements. Such measurements show no shifts in the stars' positions. Unlike the Sun, Moon, and planets, they do not change position with respect to one another over human lifetimes; the shapes of the constellations are constant. This makes them a convenient reference background for determining the shape of Earth. Adding distance measurements on the ground allows calculation of Earth's size. The fact that different stars are visible from different locations on Earth was noticed in ancient times. Aristotle wrote that some stars are visible from Egypt which are not visible from Europe. This would not be possible if Earth

  What is the ratio in brightness between the Sun and the full Moon? The apparent magnitude of the Sun is −26.74 (brighter), and the mean magnitude of the full moon is −12.74 (dimmer). Difference in magnitude: The Sun appears about 400,000 times brighter than the full moon.

  astronomers have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework; however, since the beginning of the twentieth century, professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy and associated activities. Amateur astronomers typically view the sky at night, when most celestial objects and astronomical events are visible, but others observe during the daytime by viewing the Sun and solar eclipses. Some just look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes or binoculars, but more dedicated amateurs often use portable telescopes or telescopes situated in their private or club observatories. Amateurs can also join as members of amateur astronomical societies, which can advise, educate or guide them towards ways of finding and observing celestial objects. They can also promote the science of astronomy among the general public.

In order to explain day and night, time zones, and the seasons, some flat Earth conjecturists propose that the Sun does not emit light in all directions, but acts more like a spotlight, only illuminating part of the flat Earth at a time. This conjecture is not consistent with observation: At sunrise and sunset, a spotlight Sun would be up in the sky at least a little bit, rather than at the horizon where it is always actually observed. A spotlight Sun would also appear at different angles in the sky with respect to a flat ground than it does with respect to a curved ground. Assuming

   As Earth rotates on its axis, the stars in the night sky appear to follow circular paths around the celestial poles. (This daily cycle of apparent movement is called diurnal motion.) All the stars seem fixed on a celestial sphere surrounding the observer. In the same way that positions on Earth are measured using latitude and longitude, the apparent places of stars on this sphere are measured in right ascension (equivalent to longitude) and declination (equivalent to latitude). If viewed from a latitude of 50° N on Earth, any star with a declination of +50° would pass directly overhead (reaching the zenith at upper

However, for much of Antarctica in the Southern Hemisphere's winter months, the Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (and thus Orion) are then visible at twilight for a few hours around local noon, low in the North. At the same time of day at the South Pole itself (Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station), Rigel is only 8° above the horizon, and the Belt sweeps just along it. In the Southern Hemisphere's summer months, when Orion is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation is actually not visible in Antarctica because the sun does not set at that time of year south of the Antarctic Circle. In countries close to the equator (e.g., Kenya, Indonesia, Colombia, Ecuador), Orion appears overhead in December around midnight and in the February evening sky.

   Astronomy is one of the sciences to which amateurs can contribute the most. Collectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and phenomena sometimes with equipment that they build themselves. Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae. Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky. Many amateurs like to specialize in the observation of particular objects, types of objects, or types of events that interest them. Most amateurs work at visible wavelengths, but

  too dim to be seen with the naked eye (the limit for that is 5.5). The star is not just very small and far away, it also emits comparatively little visible light, mainly shining in the invisible infrared. Even from the close in proximity of TRAPPIST-1d, about 50 times closer than Earth is from the Sun, the planet receives less than 1% the visible light Earth sees from our Sun. This would probably make the days on TRAPPIST-1d never brighter than twilight is on Earth. However, that still means that TRAPPIST-1 could easily shine at least 3000 times brighter in the sky of TRAPPIST-1d than the full moon does in Earth's night sky.

  An FM radio station transmitting at 100 MHz emits photons with an energy of about 4.1357 × 10−7 eV. This minuscule amount of energy is approximately 8 × 10−13 times the electron's mass (via mass-energy equivalence). Very-high-energy gamma rays have photon energies of 100 GeV to over 1 PeV (1011 to 1015 electronvolts) or 16 nanojoules to 160 microjoules. This corresponds to frequencies of 2.42 × 1025 to 2.42 × 1029 Hz. During photosynthesis, specific chlorophyll molecules absorb red-light photons at a wavelength of 700 nm in the photosystem I, corresponding to an energy of each photon of ≈ 2 eV ≈ 3 x 10−19 J ≈ 75 kBT, where kBT denotes the thermal energy. A minimum of 48 photons is needed for the synthesis of a single glucose molecule from CO2 and water (chemical potential difference 5 x 10−18 J) with a maximal energy conversion efficiency of 35%

  Ionizing radiation includes rays of "particles" as well as rays of "waves". Especially X-rays and Gamma rays transfer enough energy in non-thermal, (single) collision processes to separate electron(s) from an atom.

  photonics. In this context, light often includes invisible forms of radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet and infrared, in addition to visible light. Optoelectronic devices are electrical-to-optical or optical-to-electrical transducers, or instruments that use such devices in their operation. Electro-optics is often erroneously used as a synonym, but is a wider branch of physics that concerns all interactions between light and electric fields, whether or not they form part of an electronic device. Optoelectronics is based on the quantum mechanical effects of light on electronic materials, especially semiconductors, sometimes in the presence of electric fields.  Important applications of optoelectronics include:

  Photon energy is the energy carried by a single photon. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the photon's electromagnetic frequency and thus, equivalently, is inversely proportional to the wavelength. The higher the photon's frequency, the higher its energy. Equivalently, the longer the photon's wavelength, the lower its energy. Photon energy can be expressed using any unit of energy. Among the units commonly used to denote photon energy are the electronvolt (eV) and the joule (as well as its multiples, such as the microjoule). As one joule equals 6.24 × 1018 eV, the larger units may be more useful in denoting the energy of photons with higher frequency and higher energy, such as gamma rays, as opposed to lower energy photons, such as those in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

 Some computer graphical user interfaces in radiation therapy.
In this review, five graphical user interfaces (GUIs) used in radiation therapy practices and researches are introduced. They are: (1) the treatment time calculator, superficial X-ray treatment time calculator (SUPCALC) used in the superficial X-ray radiation therapy; (2) the monitor unit calculator, electron monitor unit calculator (EMUC) used in the electron radiation therapy; (3) the multileaf collimator machine file creator, sliding window intensity modulated radiotherapy (SWIMRT) used in generating fluence map for research and quality assurance in intensity modulated radiation therapy; (4) the treatment planning system, DOSCTP used in the calculation of 3D dose distribution using Monte Carlo simulation; and (5) the monitor unit calculator, photon beam monitor unit calculator (PMUC) used in photon beam radiation therapy. One common issue of these GUIs is that all user-friendly interfaces are linked to complex formulas and algorithms based on various theories, which do not have to be understood and noted by the user. In that case, user only needs to input the required information with help from graphical elements in order to produce desired results. SUPCALC is a superficial radiation treatment time calculator using the GUI technique to provide a convenient way for radiation therapist to calculate the treatment time, and keep a record for the skin cancer patient. EMUC is an electron monitor unit calculator for electron radiation therapy. Instead of doing hand calculation according to pre-determined dosimetric tables, clinical user needs only to input the required drawing of electron field in computer graphical file format, prescription dose, and beam parameters to EMUC to calculate the required monitor unit for the electron beam treatment. EMUC is based on a semi-experimental theory of sector-integration algorithm. SWIMRT is a multileaf collimator machine file creator to generate a fluence map produced by a medical linear accelerator. This machine file controls the multileaf collimator to deliver intensity modulated beams for a specific fluence map used in quality assurance or research. DOSCTP is a treatment planning system using the computed tomography images. Radiation beams (photon or electron) with different energies and field sizes produced by a linear accelerator can be placed in different positions to irradiate the tumour in the patient. DOSCTP is linked to a Monte Carlo simulation engine using the EGSnrc-based code, so that 3D dose distribution can be determined accurately for radiation therapy. Moreover, DOSCTP can be used for treatment planning of patient or small animal. PMUC is a GUI for calculation of the monitor unit based on the prescription dose of patient in photon beam radiation therapy. The calculation is based on dose corrections in changes of photon beam energy, treatment depth, field size, jaw position, beam axis, treatment distance and beam modifiers. All GUIs mentioned in this review were written either by the Microsoft Visual Basic.net or a MATLAB GUI development tool called GUIDE. In addition, all GUIs were verified and tested using measurements to ensure their accuracies were up to clinical acceptable levels for implementations.

 Excessive acoustic radiation produced by bone vibrators during bone conduction audiometry can have several implications. Firstly, it can lead to inaccurate results in high-frequency air-bone gap measurements. The study mentioned that the B-72 bone vibrator produced excessive acoustic radiation for 80% of the subjects, while the B-71 and KH 70 had lower percentages. This excessive radiation can cause an invalid high-frequency air-bone gap, which can affect the interpretation of hearing test results.

Moreover, excessive acoustic radiation can impact the overall accuracy of bone conduction audiometry. The study found that the mean amount of acoustic radiation varied significantly between the different bone vibrator types. The B-72 had the highest mean amount of acoustic radiation (8.3 dB), followed by the B-71 (4.3 dB), and the KH 70 (-0.3 dB). These variations in acoustic radiation levels can introduce inconsistencies in test results, making it challenging to obtain precise and reliable measurements.

To mitigate these implications, precautions should be taken during bone conduction audiometry to reduce or eliminate the possibility of acoustic radiation produced by bone vibrators. Additional standards in this area are also needed to ensure consistent and accurate testing procedures. By addressing and minimizing excessive acoustic radiation, healthcare professionals can improve the reliability and validity of bone conduction audiometry results.

This corresponds to frequencies of 2.42 × 1025 to 2.42 × 1029 Hz. During photosynthesis, specific chlorophyll molecules absorb red-light photons at a wavelength of 700 nm in the photosystem I, corresponding to an energy of each photon of ≈ 2 eV ≈ 3 x 10−19 J ≈ 75 kBT, where kBT denotes the thermal energy. A minimum of 48 photons is needed for the synthesis of a single glucose molecule from CO2 and water (chemical potential difference 5 x 10−18 J) with a maximal energy conversion efficiency of 35%
 4 -0.08635  Photon energy is the energy carried by a single photon. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the photon's electromagnetic frequency and thus, equivalently, is inversely proportional to the wavelength. The higher the photon's frequency, the higher its energy. Equivalently, the longer the photon's wavelength, the lower its energy. Photon energy can be expressed using any unit of energy. Among the units commonly used to denote photon energy are the electronvolt (eV) and the joule (as well as its multiples, such as the microjoule). As one joule equals 6.24 × 1018 eV, the larger units may be more useful in denoting the energy of photons with higher frequency and higher energy, such as gamma rays, as opposed to lower energy photons, such as those in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum.

  Normally when colder conditions arrive, animals go into a state of suspended animation called hibernation, when they go into a state of inactivity for long periods of time, which they do not come out of until more suitable conditions for them to survive in arrive. However, when animals live in an environment that is inhospitable for much of the year, then hibernation is not necessary. One of the few animals that does so are lemmings, which have a mass migration after they come out of dormancy. However, most animals living in the arctic would still be active, even during the most brutal times of winter. Aquatic animals

In Alaska, only 14–17% of subadult males and 30–48% of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood. Across the range, the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%. With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or a gray wolf pack, adult American black bears are not usually subject to natural predation.

  the snow which allows them to walk more easily. Despite almost being frozen, some insects can survive by going into a dormant state and allowing their naturally occurring antifreeze-like compounds to take effect. The most common coping strategy, however, is to migrate seasonally and find a more suitable habitat for the winter, which can commonly be seen in birds. Animals have a small window of opportunity to successfully reproduce and birth of their young has to coincide with the abundance of prey otherwise the food chain will be disrupted. Species that have adapted well tend to dominate the food chain.

   American black bears were once not considered true or "deep" hibernators, but because of discoveries about the metabolic changes that allow American black bears to remain dormant for months without eating, drinking, urinating or defecating, most biologists have redefined mammalian hibernation as "specialized, seasonal reduction in metabolism concurrent with scarce food and cold weather". American black bears are now considered highly efficient hibernators. The physiology of American black bears in the wild is closely related to that of bears in captivity. Understanding the physiology of bears in the wild is vital to the bear's success in captivity. The bears enter their dens in October and November, although in the southernmost areas of

  The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), also known as the white fox, polar fox, or snow fox, is a small fox native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere and common throughout the Arctic tundra biome. It is well adapted to living in cold environments, and is best known for its thick, warm fur that is also used as camouflage. It has a large and very fluffy tail. In the wild, most individuals do not live past their first year but some exceptional ones survive up to 11 years. Its body length ranges from 46 to 68 cm, with a generally rounded body shape to minimize the escape of body heat. The Arctic fox preys on many small creatures such as lemmings, voles, ringed seal pups, fish, waterfowl, and seabirds. It also eats carrion, berries, seaweed, and insects and other small invertebrates. Arctic foxes form monogamous pairs during the breeding season and they stay together to raise their young in complex underground dens. Occasionally, other family members may assist in raising their young. Natural predators of the Arctic fox are golden eagles, Arctic wolves, polar bears, wolverines, red foxes, and grizzly bears.

  deer is rare, but it has been recorded. They may even hunt prey up to the size of adult female moose, which are considerably larger than themselves, by ambushing them. There is at least one record of a male American black bear killing two bull elk over the course of six days by chasing them into deep snow banks, which impeded their movements. In Labrador, American black bears are exceptionally carnivorous, living largely off caribou, usually young, injured, old, sickly or dead specimens, and rodents such as voles. This is believed to be due to a paucity of edible plant life in this sub-Arctic region

  The Arctic fox lives in some of the most frigid extremes on the planet, but they do not start to shiver until the temperature drops to -70 °C. Among its adaptations for survival in the cold is its dense, multilayered pelage, which provides excellent insulation. Additionally, the Arctic fox is the only canid whose foot pads are covered in fur. There are two genetically distinct coat color morphs: white and blue. The white morph has seasonal camouflage, white in winter and brown along the back with light grey around the abdomen in summer. The blue morph is often a dark blue, brown, or grey color year-round. Although the blue allele is dominant over the white allele, 99% of the Arctic fox population is the white morph. Two similar mutations to MC1R cause the blue color and the lack of seasonal color change. The fur of the Arctic fox provides the best insulation of any mammal. The fox has a low surface area to volume ratio, as evidenced by its generally compact body shape, short muzzle and legs, and short, thick ears. Since less of its surface area is exposed to the Arctic cold, less heat escapes from its body.

  the foot, was long thought to have pointed posterior to the remaining digits, as in perching birds. Therefore, researchers once concluded that Archaeopteryx used the hallux as a balancing mechanism on tree limbs. However, study of the Thermopolis specimen of Archeopteryx, which has the most complete foot of any known, showed that the hallux was not in fact reversed, limiting the creature's ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. Another skeletal feature that is similar in Archaeopteryx and modern birds is the curvature of the claws. Archaeopteryx possessed the same claw curvature of the foot to that of perching birds. However,

  appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features—the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.—as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the Deinonychus leg as support for his idea that a different set of

  accipitrid birds of prey: by leaping onto its quarry, pinning it under its body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range

  prey items for swallowing. In 2011, a study suggested that the sickle claw would likely have been used to pin down prey while biting it, rather than as a slashing weapon. Biomechanical studies by Ken Carpenter in 2002 confirmed that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated coracoid, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that Deinonychus could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian

  Dromaeosaurids, especially Deinonychus, are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that Deinonychus was fleet-footed in his original description. However, when first described, a complete leg of Deinonychus had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the femur (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the ratio of the femur to the tibia (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern fleet-footed birds, like the ostrich, the foot-tibia ratio

  contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by Jacques Gauthier and Gregory S. Paul in 1988. Studies by Phil Senter in 2006 indicated that Deinonychus forelimbs could be used not only for grasping, but also for clutching objects towards the chest. If Deinonychus had feathered fingers and wings, the feathers would have limited the range of motion of the forelimbs to some degree. For example, when Deinonychus extended its arm forward, the 'palm' of the hand automatically rotated to an upward-facing position. This would have caused one wing to block the other if both forelimbs were extended at the same

• Most chronic pain syndromes do not require laboratory testing to make a diagnosis. • The treatment of most chronic pain syndromes is not based on laboratory test findings. #### **DON'T DIAGNOSE BY ONE TEST**

It would therefore be foolhardy to expect that a machine that measures one single aspect of biologic function or takes a picture of a bodily structure can find the source of chronic pain. Just as it is foolish for a surgeon to perform exploratory surgery on a patient to find his or her pain, it is foolish for a doctor to order a laboratory test to find the pain. As one famous pain authority and neurosurgeon, Dr. John D. Loeser (one of our wisest pain management teachers and colleagues), has taught for many decades, "If a surgeon does surgery to try to find the pain of his patient, it will never be found." #### **TEST TO RULE OUT WHAT YOU DO NOT HAVE**

When using laboratory tests, the rules for chronic pain diagnosis and treatment are very different compared to most other medical conditions. You must alter your expectations and your doctors must change their practices when it comes to diagnosing and treating chronic pain. You must not expect a laboratory test to show precisely where the pain is and why it is causing you so much unpleasantness and suffering; and your doctors must learn not to treat the test result, but to treat you, the entire patient. ### Lab Tests Frequently Ordered by Doctors for Chronic Pain

Table 16.1 lists the types of lab tests that doctors frequently order in an effort to diagnose a patient's chronic pain. These tests are divided into two groups: radiological tests and electrophysiological studies. #### **WHAT DO THE DIFFERENT TESTS TELL US?These tests can tell us many things, including whether bones are broken; whether your internal organs, such as your liver, lungs, or kidneys, have abnormal growths or tumors; if soft tissues (muscles, ligaments, and tendons) are torn or inflamed; or if spinal discs are bulging.Electrophysiological studies measure different electrical abilities of nerves.

 The information below pertains to New York State laws. Laws vary from state to state. Please check with your local State Health Department for specifics on your area.
A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order in the patient's medical chart instructs the medical staff not to try to revive the patient if breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This means physicians, nurses and others will not initiate such emergency procedures as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, external chest compression, electric shock, insertion of a tube to open the patient's airway, injection of medication into the heart or open chest heart massage.
If the patient is in a nursing home a DNR order instructs the staff not to perform emergency resuscitation and not to transfer the patient to a hospital for such procedures.
Yes. Under New York law, all adult patients can request a DNR order. If you are sick and incapable of deciding about resuscitation, a family member or others close to you can decide on your behalf.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of CPR?
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), when successful, restores heartbeat and breathing and enables a patient to resume his or her previous lifestyle. In other cases, CPR may fail to restore basic life functions or only partially succeed, leaving the patient brain-damaged or otherwise impaired.
The success of CPR depends of the patient's overall medical condition and level of functioning before hospitalization. Age alone is not a predictor of success, although illnesses and frailties associated with advanced age often result in less successful outcomes.
Is my right to request or receive other treatment affected by a DNR order?
No. A DNR order is only a decision about CPR and does not relate to other treatment.
Are DNR orders ethically acceptable?
It is widely recognized by healthcare professionals, clergy, lawyers and others that DNR orders are medically and ethically appropriate under certain circumstances. For some patients, CPR offers more burdens than benefits and may be contrary to the patient's wishes.
Is my consent required for a DNR order?
Yes, your physician must obtain your consent before entering a DNR order in your record if you are mentally capable of deciding, unless a discussion about CPR and your condition would cause you severe harm. In an emergency, it is assumed that all patients would consent to CPR unless a DNR order is in the record.
An adult patient in a hospital or nursing home can consent to a DNR order orally, as long as two witnesses are present. One witness must be a physician. You can also make your wishes known before or during hospitalization in writing, before any two adults who must sign your statement as witnesses. A living will may be used to convey these wishes as long as it is properly witnessed.
You can specify that you want a DNR order only under certain circumstances (such as if you become terminally ill or permanently unconscious) or that you wish only specific CPR procedures performed such as mouth-to-mouth breathing but not open heart massage.
Before making a decision about CPR you should speak with your physician about your overall health and the benefits and burdens CPR would provide for you. A full and early discussion between you and your doctor can avoid later misunderstandings.
If I request a DNR order, is my physician bound to honor my wishes?
refer the matter to a dispute mediation system in the hospital or nursing home. The mediation system is only authorized to mediate disputes; it cannot overrule your decision.
If mediation has not resolved the dispute within 72 hours, your physician must enter the order or transfer you to the care of another physician.
What happens if I do not have the capacity to decide for myself?
You are presumed by law to be mentally capable of deciding about CPR unless two physicians, or a court, determines that you no longer have the capacity to make the decision. You will be informed of this determination if you are able to understand it, and no DNR order will be written if you object.
If I do not have the mental capacity to make a decision about CPR and do not leave instructions in advance, who will decide?
How can I select someone to decide for me?
If you are a patient in a hospital or nursing home, you can appoint a person orally with two witnesses present.
You can also appoint someone during or in advance of hospitalization by stating your wishes in writing and signing that statement with any two adults present. The adults must also sign your written statement.
Under What circumstances can a family member or close friend consent to a DNR order?
CPR would impose an extraordinary burden on you given your medical condition and the expected outcome of resuscitation.
Anyone deciding for you must base the decision on your wishes, including your religious and moral beliefs, or if your wishes are not known, on your best interest.
What if members of my family disagree?
They can ask for the matter to be mediated. Your physician will request mediation if he or she is aware of any disagreement among family members.
What if I lose the capacity to decide and do not have anyone who can decide on my behalf?
A DNR order can be entered only if two physicians conclude that CPR would be medically useless or if a court approves the DNR order. It would be best if you discussed the matter with your physician and left instructions in advance.
Who can consent to a DNR order for children?
A DNR order can be entered in the record for a patient under the age of 18 only with the consent of the patient's parent or guardian. If the minor has the capacity to decide, the minor's consent is also required for a DNR order.
What happens if I change my mind after I consent to a DNR order?
You or anyone who consents to a DNR order on your behalf can withdraw that consent at any time by informing your physician, nurses or others of the decision.
What happens to a DNR order if I am transferred from a nursing home to a hospital or vice versa?
The health facility where you are sent can continue the DNR order but is not obligated to do so. If the order is not continued, you or anyone who decided on your behalf will be informed and can request that the order be entered again.

 If you have additional questions about your procedure, feel free to contact us at any time. The information listed on this site is NOT a substitute for medical advice from your physician or other medical professional.
General questions and answers about the procedures and how to prepare for imaging.
It varies from procedure to procedure. Depending on the type of exam that you are having, it may take anywhere from a half an hour to 3 hours.
The prep for each type of exam varies. You will be given instructions on what you should do before your exam. If you have questions about the preparation, contact your doctor or a professional at ADI.
What will happen during my MRI exam?
The MRI table will slide you into the scanner, so that your body is in the middle of the scanner. The scan will begin when you are ready. It is extremely important for you to hold very still during the scan in order to get the best quality images possible.
If I am getting an MRI is there anything that the staff needs to know about me?
Besides complete information about your medical history, your doctor and the MR staff must know if you have any metal in your body which cannot be removed, including: pacemakers, implanted insulin pumps, aneurysm clips, vascular coils and filters, heart valves etc. VERY IMPORTANT! DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BE SCANNED IF YOU HAVE A PACEMAKER OR OTHER IMPLANTED MECHANICALLY, ELECTRICALLY OR MAGNETICALLY ACTIVATED DEVICE. UNLESS SPECIFICALLY ORDERED BY THE RADIOLOGIST, YOU WILL NOT BE SCANNED IF YOU HAVE METAL IMPLANTS IN THE HEAD REGION.
A CT or CAT scan is the term that describes a radiologic test known as computed tomography. This diagnostic imaging procedure uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce cross-sectional images (often called slices) of organs and body parts such as lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, pelvis, extremities, brain, spine and blood vessels.
Typically, your tests are read within 24 hours by ADI’s local radiologists and then forwarded to your referring physician.

 As a specialist in internal medicine, assessing the condition of the heart is a key part of the service. Dr. Steven Kamara did his internal medicine residency at Cedars Sinai Medical Center and remained in Los Angeles, California when he opened his private practice. Fluent in five languages, he is able to serve the diverse population in the area as a primary care physician.
EKG stands for electrocardiogram. It offers the doctor a window into the electrical activity of your heart. The human heart has a natural electrical system that allows it to draw in blood and then pump it back out. It takes a sophisticated system to accomplish those two actions. The job of EKG testing services to measure and record the various electrical impulses that make it work.
What is the doctor looking for when he orders EKG Testing?
Ultimately, it is about assessing the overall health of your heart.
What do I do to prepare for an EKG?
There is no specific patient prep for an EKG like there are for other tests. For example, you don’t have to fast before getting an electrocardiogram. Prior to the test, tell the doctor what medications you take, even over-the-counter drugs like pain killers or vitamins. The doctor may give you instructions about taking some medication, especially if testing the effectiveness of a drug plan.
During the test, the technician will ask you to remove your jewelry and open your shirt to expose your chest. Electrodes are connected to different points around you chest and they must touch bare skin in order to collect accurate data.

  health conditions, including viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections and blood disorders such as leukemia. White blood cell differentials may be performed by an automated analyzer – a machine designed to run laboratory tests – or manually, by examining blood smears under a microscope. The test was performed manually until white blood cell differential analyzers were introduced in the 1970s, making the automated differential possible. In the automated differential, a blood sample is loaded onto an analyzer, which samples a small volume of blood and measures various properties of white blood cells to produce a differential count. The manual differential, in which white blood cells are counted on

  A white blood cell differential is a medical laboratory test that provides information about the types and amounts of white blood cells in a person's blood. The test, which is usually ordered as part of a complete blood count (CBC), measures the amounts of the five normal white blood cell types – neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils – as well as abnormal cell types if they are present. These results are reported as percentages and absolute values, and compared against reference ranges to determine whether the values are normal, low, or high. Changes in the amounts of white blood cells can aid in the diagnosis of

  The white blood cell differential is a common blood test that is often ordered alongside a complete blood count. The test may be performed as part of a routine medical examination; to investigate certain symptoms, particularly those suggestive of infection or hematological disorders; or to monitor existing conditions, such as blood disorders and inflammatory diseases. Five types of white blood cells are normally found in blood: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. Marked shifts in the proportions of these cell types, as measured by the automated or manual differential, can indicate various health conditions. Additionally, cell types which do not normally occur in the blood, such as blast cells, can be identified by the manual differential. These cell types may be found in blood disorders and other pathological states. The manual differential can also identify changes in the appearance of white blood cells, such

 Excessive sugar intake can have a negative impact on the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals in the body. When sugar levels in the bloodstream are high, it can interfere with the absorption of certain nutrients.

One example is vitamin C. Sugar and vitamin C use the same transporters to reach the cells. When there is an excess of sugar in the bloodstream, it competes with vitamin C for absorption through these transporters. Consequently, increased glucose levels can inhibit vitamin C from entering the cells, leading to limited vitamin absorption. This can result in suppressed tissue regeneration and decreased immune function.

Another nutrient affected by excessive sugar intake is vitamin D. Sugar promotes the expression of enzymes that degrade vitamin D while simultaneously decreasing enzymes needed to synthesize the vitamin. This can lead to vitamin D deficiency, which has been associated with various health conditions such as autoimmunity, dementia, infection, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. 

In addition to vitamins, minerals can also be impacted by excessive sugar consumption. High blood sugar and insulin levels, which are a result of excessive sugar intake, can promote the excretion of magnesium by the kidneys and inhibit its reabsorption. This leads to a depletion of magnesium reserves in the body. Magnesium is essential for various bodily functions, including blood sugar control, muscle and nerve regulation, and bone building. Therefore, excreting this essential mineral from the body can have adverse health effects.

Overall, excessive sugar intake can deplete and reduce the absorption of essential vitamins like vitamin C and D, as well as the mineral magnesium. It is important to be mindful of the amount of sugar consumed to maintain optimal nutrient absorption and overall health.

 Smoking can have a negative impact on the body's ability to absorb essential vitamins and minerals. It can lead to deficiencies in various nutrients, including calcium, vitamins C and D, vitamins A, E, and the B-vitamin group, as well as minerals such as selenium, zinc, copper, and iron. These deficiencies can occur due to both decreased intake of nutrients and the effects of smoking on the body.

One of the ways smoking affects nutrient absorption is by narrowing the blood vessels and affecting circulation. This can limit the delivery of nutrients to different tissues and organs, impairing their absorption and utilization. Additionally, smoking accelerates the production of free radicals, which can cause damage to organs and tissues.

Nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, is known to negatively impact the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. For example, smoking can result in poor absorption of vitamin D, increasing the risk of conditions like osteoporosis.

Therefore, it is important for smokers to be aware of these potential nutrient deficiencies and take steps to maintain a healthy diet and potentially consider supplementation to meet their nutritional needs. Quitting smoking can also improve nutrient absorption and overall health.

 Vitamin D, along with other vitamins, provides sun protection.
2 What Characteristic Is Shared by Vitamins B6, B12, C & Folate?
An essential part of your diet, vitamin D has a number of physiological functions, from regulating calcium to controlling gene activity. While it does not interact directly with other vitamins, vitamin D does work in combination with several vitamins in your cells and organs. Following a well-balanced diet helps provide enough vitamin D to support your health and also increases your intake of other vitamins that complement vitamin D's function.
Vitamin D works in combination with other vitamins to maintain the health of your skin. Vitamins A, D and E all offer photoprotection -- natural protection to prevent skin damage associated with the sun's harmful rays. Both vitamins A and D also control the growth of new skin cells and promote the development of keratinocytes, the major cell type found in your skin. Vitamin D also maintains healthy hair follicles and prevents hair loss.
Vitamin D works in combination with vitamin C to keep your bones healthy. Vitamin C helps promote collagen synthesis, a process essential to maintain the strength of collagen-rich tissues, including your bones. Vitamin D helps regulate calcium, another essential component of bone tissue. A deficiency in either vitamin D or C negatively affects your bone tissue -- low vitamin C levels cause joint pain, while vitamin D deficiency puts you at risk of developing osteoporosis.
Vitamin D also proves important for a healthy immune system and works in combination with vitamins A and B-6 to boost immunity. Vitamins A and B-6 both aid in the development of new white blood cells -- the immune cells that recognize and attack pathogens -- while vitamin D regulates white blood cell function. Vitamin D also triggers the release of antimicrobial proteins used to help kill pathogens, while vitamin B-6 controls the release of cytokines -- a family of proteins that stimulate an immune response.
A healthful diet provides the range of vitamins your body needs to support vitamin D's function. For example, most fruits and vegetables serve as good sources of vitamin C, while dark leafy greens and orange fruits and vegetables offer beneficial vitamin A. Adding sources of healthy fat, such as hazelnuts or almonds, to your diet helps boost your vitamin E intake, while bananas, chicken and potatoes offer vitamin B-6. Boost your vitamin D intake with dairy products, and get moderate sun exposure to support vitamin D synthesis in your skin.

 According to the research conducted by Dr. Paul Kouchakoff, the impact of cooked food on the immune system is different compared to raw food. When cooked food is ingested, the body's immune system responds by increasing the number of white blood cells, which is known as "digestive leukocytosis." This reaction is typically seen as a defense mechanism against stress, infection, trauma, toxins, or any harmful substances. However, Dr. Kouchakoff found that raw food doesn't cause this increase in white blood cells, indicating that it is viewed as "friendly" by the immune system. On the other hand, cooked food is perceived as dangerous by the immune system, leading to a negative overall effect known as "pathological leukocytosis."

This difference in immune system response suggests that cooked food may have a more detrimental impact on the body compared to raw food. Additionally, the research conducted by Dr. Francis Pottenger, who studied the effects of raw and cooked food on cats, further supports the benefits of raw food. He found that cats on an entirely raw-food diet were very healthy and didn't require veterinary care.

The reason for these differences may be attributed to the fact that cooked protein and fat are more difficult to digest compared to their raw counterparts. This adds a strain on the body and can affect overall health, activity, and longevity. Furthermore, impaired digestion may result in the body's inability to produce certain nutrients and biochemicals that are naturally formed in a healthy digestive system, such as vitamin K and some B vitamins.

In conclusion, the research suggests that cooked food may have a more negative impact on the immune system compared to raw food. Incorporating raw food into one's diet may provide potential benefits in terms of immune system function and overall health. It is important to note that individual dietary needs may vary, and consulting with a healthcare professional or nutritionist is recommended for personalized advice.

  or other water-based effluents. Apart from food, many poisons readily enter the body through the skin and lungs. Hydrofluoric acid is a notorious contact poison, in addition to its corrosive damage. Naturally occurring sour gas is a notorious, fast-acting atmospheric poison (as released by volcanic activity or drilling rigs). Plant-based contact irritants, such as that possessed by poison ivy or poison oak, are often classed as allergens rather than poisons; the effect of an allergen being not a poison as such, but to turn the body's natural defenses against itself. Poison can also enter the body through faulty medical implants, or

  Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, but the term alloy steel usually only refers to steels that contain other elements— like vanadium, molybdenum, or cobalt—in amounts sufficient to alter the properties of the base steel. Since ancient times, when steel was used primarily for tools and weapons, the methods of producing and working the metal were often closely guarded secrets. Even long after the Age of reason, the steel industry was very competitive and manufacturers went through great lengths to keep their processes confidential, resisting any attempts to scientifically analyze the material for fear it would reveal their methods.

   A magnet is a material or object that produces a magnetic field. This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials, such as iron, steel, nickel, cobalt, etc. and attracts or repels other magnets. A permanent magnet is an object made from a material that is magnetized and creates its own persistent magnetic field. An everyday example is a refrigerator magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials that can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic (or ferrimagnetic). These include the elements iron, nickel and cobalt and their alloys, some

  Powdered cores made of carbonyl iron, a highly pure iron, have high stability of parameters across a wide range of temperatures and magnetic flux levels, with excellent Q factors between 50 kHz and 200 MHz. Carbonyl iron powders are basically constituted of micrometer-size spheres of iron coated in a thin layer of electrical insulation. This is equivalent to a microscopic laminated magnetic circuit (see silicon steel, above), hence reducing the eddy currents, particularly at very high frequencies. Carbonyl iron has lower losses than hydrogen-reduced iron, but also lower permeability. A popular application of carbonyl iron-based magnetic cores is in high-frequency and broadband inductors and transformers, especially higher power ones. Carbonyl iron cores are often called "RF cores". The as-prepared particles, "E-type"and have onion-like skin, with concentric shells separated with a gap. They contain significant amount of carbon. They behave as much smaller than what their outer size would suggest. The "C-type" particles can be prepared by heating the E-type ones in hydrogen atmosphere at 400 °C for prolonged time, resulting in carbon-free powders.

  Usually metal furniture is made from either steel or aluminum. To tell aluminum from steel, place a magnet on a metal surface and if it is steel it will stick. Steel furniture is typically pricier when it is used as furniture, with the price varying according to the type of metal and thickness. However, it is hard to identify it after a finish is applied. Steel has low, medium or high carbon, with most metal furniture being made with low carbon because it is cheaper than a higher grade of carbon. Stainless steel is good for low maintenance.

  Many materials have unpaired electron spins, and the majority of these materials are paramagnetic. When the spins interact with each other in such a way that the spins align spontaneously, the materials are called ferromagnetic (what is often loosely termed as magnetic). Because of the way their regular crystalline atomic structure causes their spins to interact, some metals are ferromagnetic when found in their natural states, as ores. These include iron ore (magnetite or lodestone), cobalt and nickel, as well as the rare earth metals gadolinium and dysprosium (when at a very low temperature). Such naturally occurring ferromagnets were used in the first experiments with magnetism. Technology has since expanded the availability of magnetic materials to include various man-made products, all based, however, on naturally magnetic elements.

 Hardware disease is a common term for bovine traumatic reticulopericarditis. It is usually caused by the ingestion of a sharp, metallic object. These pieces of metal settle in the reticulum and can irritate or penetrate the lining.   It is most common in dairy cattle, but is occasionally seen in beef cattle. It is very rarely reported in any other ruminants. It can be difficult to conclusively diagnose, but can be prevented by the oral administration of a magnet around the time that the animal reaches the age of one year.

Causes 
Cattle commonly swallow foreign objects, because they do not use their lips to discriminate between materials and they do not completely chew their feed before swallowing. Sharp metallic objects, such as nails or wire, are the common initiators of hardware disease. The object travels into the rumen and is then pushed into the reticulum along with the rest of the feed. In some cases, contractions of the reticulum can push the object through part of the reticulum wall into the peritoneal cavity, where it causes severe inflammation. In rare cases, the metal object penetrates the entire wall of the reticulum and can pierce the heart sac, causing pericarditis.  Compression by the uterus in late pregnancy, straining during parturition and mounting during estrus can increase the likelihood of the object penetrating the abdominal wall or the heart sac.

Diagnosis 
Diagnosis is typically based on history and clinical findings when the veterinarian examines the cow. Symptoms of hardware disease vary depending on where the object penetrates. The cow exhibits an arched back, a reluctance to move and a slow, careful gait. The cow may groan when lying down, getting up, defecating and urinating. The heart rate is normal or slightly elevated, and the respiration is shallow and rapid. In dairy cows, there is often a decrease in milk production. Laboratory tests are not always necessary, but increases in fibrinogen and total plasma protein often result from hardware disease and may be diagnosed with a blood sample. Electronic metal detectors can be used, but not all heavy sharp objects will be metal and it does not distinguish between penetrating and nonpenetrating bodies. Radiographs are also used and are advantageous because the location of the metallic body can be identified. However, if the sharp object is not metallic or dense enough the radiograph is of no use. If there is inflammation in either the Peritoneal cavity or the Pericardium, it can be detected using an ultrasonograph.

Treatment 
If hardware disease is suspected, a magnet should be administered orally through a tube into the reticulum. Depending on the type of magnet used, inserting a second magnet could cause internal pinching which could lead to serious complications. A broad-spectrum antibiotic should also be given to control infection. The cow should be confined and movement limited in the hopes that the reticulum can repair the hole. Surgery is necessary in some cases and involves rumenotomy with a physical removal of the object. In some advanced cases that don’t respond to medical or surgical therapy, slaughter is often considered from an economic perspective.

Prevention 

Good feed management is also important; in smaller operations, some farmers pass metal detectors or magnets over the feed.

A cow magnet is a  veterinary medical device for the treatment or prevention of hardware disease in cattle.  Traditionally, cow magnets were strong Alnico magnets about 1 cm by 8 cm (0.4 by 3.1 inches) in the shape of a smoothed rod, but today they are more commonly several ring-shaped ferrite magnets attached to a stainless-steel or plastic core, in the same shape as the single-piece original. Newer designs to help increase effectiveness include a cage design, in which the magnet holds metal objects inside a protective plastic framework. Even newer designs include a stronger array of rare-earth magnets inside a stainless steel body that resembles the original Alnico design. 

A rancher or dairy farmer feeds a magnet to each calf at branding time; the magnet settles in the rumen or reticulum and remains there for the life of the animal.

The  magnet is administered after fasting the cow for 18–24 hours. This is most effective if done to the entire herd before the age of one.

The cow magnet attracts such objects and prevents them from becoming lodged in the animal's tissue. While the resultant mass of iron remains in the cow's rumen as a pseudobezoar (an intentionally introduced bezoar), it does not cause the severe problems of hardware disease.

Cow magnets are widely available from veterinary, feed supply, and scientific supply sources.

There is so much carbon present that the hardness cannot be switched off. Hence, cast iron is a brittle metal, which can break like glass. Cast iron cannot be forged without special heat treatment to convert it to malleable iron.

   An alloy is an admixture of metals, or a metal combined with one or more other elements. For example, combining the metallic elements gold and copper produces red gold, gold and silver becomes white gold, and silver combined with copper produces sterling silver. Combining iron with non-metallic carbon or silicon produces alloys called steel or silicon steel. The resulting mixture forms a substance with properties that often differ from those of the pure metals, such as increased strength or hardness. Unlike other substances that may contain metallic bases but do not behave as metals, such as aluminium oxide (sapphire), beryllium aluminium silicate (emerald) or sodium chloride (salt), an alloy will retain all the properties of a metal in the resulting material,

 Each magnet has two poles, north (yin/green) and south (yang/red).Magnets possess the ability to attract certain substances, such as iron.A magnet is an object, such as a piece of iron or steel, that is charged with an electromagnetic field.As this emphasis shifts, medicine will undergo rapid change, such as illustrated by the use of magnets in healing.Tibetan bells, crystal bowls, Gregorian and Buddhist chants, mantras, and the most natural and powerful, "over toning" (vocal harmonics with the human voice) are among the tools still used today to achieve spiritual realization and healing. They can be used for healing our cats as well. (See "Music" in Resources on page 174 for suppliers' contact information.) Music reduces stress, and you and your cats can experience many benefits by listening together. Animal facilities from shelters to dairy barns use music to keep animals calm, healthy, and productive. Cats respond quite favorably to Mozart. Perhaps this can be explained by a study which found that listening to ten minutes of a Mozart piano sonata improved the scores of college students in a test of abstract reasoning. The researchers believe the music stimulated brain cell activity. You might want to leave your radio on a classical music station to keep your cats content while you are out. Whatever soothing sounds or music you choose should be enjoyed by not only you but your cats, too. ### MAGNETIC THERAPY

The oldest form of physical therapy known to human-kind, magnetic therapy dates back to 420 b.c. when Hippocrates used magnets to treat jaundice and hernias. Biochemistry has historically overshadowed biophysics. As this emphasis shifts, medicine will undergo rapid change, such as illustrated by the use of magnets in healing. A magnet is an object, such as a piece of iron or steel, that is charged with an electromagnetic field. Magnets possess the ability to attract certain substances, such as iron. Each magnet has two poles, north (yin/green) and south (yang/red).In addition, exposure to north decreases the white blood cell count and increases the red blood cell count, which when done just after birth increases the life span by decreasing protein metabolism and thus increasing intelligence.(Note: The south pole increases intelligence when used just _before_ birth).

  Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young. Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs. The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate. Nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea. Mammals are amniotes, and most are viviparous, giving birth to live young. The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia. Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development.

This allows the researchers to tell whether the bats are changing the pitch of their calls in flight.

She will often stay close to her dead offspring for short periods of time and may investigate the reasons for the baby's non-response.

This twittering call is given when the bat is excited or before leaving the roost to feed. A chirp uttered by the species resembles crickets.

 About a week ago I had and ultra-sound and a hysteroscope. My Dr. said that the lining of my uterus was thick but my uterus was of normal size. She said that it was probably a polyp. She then did a biopsy of the tissue lining of the uterus. She said that it was difficult to get out because something in my uterus was hard. What could have been “hard” inside of my uterus???
I am 34 years old and my complaints have been heavy bleeding, big blood clots, pain in my pelvic region that feels as if a bowling ball was sitting on my pelvic bones, constant bloating, my stomache is so bloated that I look about 4 months pregnant, (my tubes are tied), chronic constapation, lower back pain for sometimes brief moments or sometimes days.
I have read so much on uterine fibroids, polyps, and nothing refers to anything being hard.
Thanks so much for any information that you might have.
Your symptoms are classic for Adenomyosis. Tissue biopsy is the only way to confirm the diagnosis, however, not all biopsies are successful.
This disease is associated with a hard, painful uterus, heavy bleeding and clots.
Most gyns will recommend hysterectomy…we recommend our FAS procedure that will laser remove the disease. We reconstruct the uterus to prevent the major side effects that can occur after hysterectomy.
You may want to have an MRI done to check for changes in the uterine muscle..however you will need a good radiologist to diagnose the disease.
Okay, finally my doctor scheduled me for a D&C on July 9th. I asked for a MRI to see if maybe there would be something there that would indicate that I suspect that I have adenmyosis. I was told that the MRIs are not very good in the pelvic region for finding anything that the ultrasound was the best. (Everything that I have read has said otherwise.) I was given 3 choices by my doctor. 1 was to do nothing, the 2nd was to do a D&C, and the 3rd was a hysterectomy. The only reasonable thing to do was the D&C. Everything has been the same for the last 6 months or longer, heavy bleeding, large blood clots, swollen stomache, the feeling of a bowling ball sitting on my pelvic bones, constipation, but now I have hemorroids. Could this be related? Also I have found a protrusion (like a lump) above my pubic bone and a larger one on my left side of my stomache, could this be related?
These other problems are probably not related. You should have them looked at by a physician. Hemorrhoids will occur with straining, if you are constipated.
Your D&C may temporarily stop your heavy bleeding and clots, but once the endometrial lining builds up again, the symptoms will reoccur. It is a wasted procedure that buys time. You need to have the adeno removed. Your symptoms will only continue to worsen the longer you delay.
I have irregular periods, bleeding heavy and other time not at all. My periods come every 2months. I have alot of pain, to the point, that I have to Lay down. Had a ultrasound and transvaginal one. Results: the Uterus measures 10.1×5.5×2.3cm I also have a fundal fibroid posteriorly measuring about 24mm. Also, I have to simple cysts measuring 8mm and 10mm. They have suggested I have a hysterectomy. What do you think?

   A powder is a dry, bulk solid composed of many very fine particles that may flow freely when shaken or tilted. Powders are a special sub-class of granular materials, although the terms powder and granular are sometimes used to distinguish separate classes of material. In particular, powders refer to those granular materials that have the finer grain sizes, and that therefore have a greater tendency to form clumps when flowing. Granulars refers to the coarser granular materials that do not tend to form clumps except when wet.

 What Fruits Are Easiest To Digest?
People who have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often find themselves wondering what to eat. Often, this results in a diet that consists mainly of simple carbohydrates and tea, which is not a nourishing diet for someone who requires extra nutrients. While a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist or dietician are going to be the best source of information about diet, there is also a certain amount of trial and error that needs to be undertaken. What some people, especially those recently diagnosed or not feeling well, might not realize right away is that there are better choices available when it comes to foods. Fruits that are easier to digest may be helpful additions to the diet. A diet consisting of many fresh foods is the best way to receive vitamins and minerals.
Remember to check with a doctor before making any additions or deletions in a diet plan. Keeping a food and symptom diary is also a good idea when making dietary changes.
Papaya is one example of a fruit that is often easier to digest, and in fact, it can actually aid the digestion of protein. Papayas contain an enzyme called papain that breaks down proteins and makes them more available for use by the body. In fact, it's so effective that this enzyme is used as a meat tenderizer.
Like most fruits, papayas are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Some of the vitamins and minerals that can be found in papayas include those that people who have IBD may find themselves deficient: vitamin A, vitamin K, and folate.
Bananas are one of the world's most perfect foods. From a practical standpoint, they couldn't be any easier to eat—they come in their own packaging and can be eaten almost anywhere without utensils or even a napkin. They are a good source of potassium, which is a nutrient that people with IBD may be lacking. Other vitamins and minerals contained in bananas include magnesium, B vitamins, and vitamin C. Bananas are easy to digest and are often recommended for people who are experiencing vomiting and diarrhea. People with a j-pouch or an ileostomy may find that bananas will help thicken up the output and help to avoid or clear up loose stools.
The best type of banana for those with IBD is going to be when there is no more green on the skin and it is yellow or even beginning to see some brown spots. A ripe banana will contain more antioxidants than an unripened one and will also be easier to digest.
Cantaloupe is a type of melon with a fragrant, fleshy interior. In the United States, the cantaloupe we often find in the grocery store is actually called a muskmelon. All the varieties of cantaloupes contain many nutrients important to better health, and in fact contain some that are quite important to people who have IBD. Cantaloupes are high in vitamins A and C, as well as potassium, dietary fiber, and antioxidants.
Cantaloupes are sweet when eaten raw, and because the flesh of the fruit is so soft, can be easily blended into a smoothie. It can also be mixed into a fruit salad with other easy to digest fruits, or eaten with yogurt.
Cantaloupes should be sliced and eaten when they are properly ripened so that the flesh is not too hard. To choose a ripe cantaloupe, give the end of the melon a little push. You should feel a little bit of give in the outer rind—it should not sink in too much, or be hard and resistant. To save the cantaloupe for eating in a few days, choose one that does have the harder rind on the end, and let it ripen on the counter for a day or two. After it is ripe, store it in the refrigerator.
Watermelon brings on thoughts of summer barbecues and eating at a picnic table outside. But many grocery stores stock watermelon all year-round, which is good news for people with IBD who need nutrient-packed, easily digestible foods in their diet. The seedless variety isn't completely seedless, but it is largely so, which is also helpful for those who need to avoid the seeds in their food.
Most people would probably guess that watermelon is high in antioxidants and beta-carotene, but also vitamins A and C, which is helpful for people who have IBD that are looking to increase their intake of those vitamins. But watermelon also contains some potassium—not as much as some other foods, but yet a little surprising extra for this melon.
True to its name, watermelon has a high water content. Hydration is key for people with IBD.
Honeydew is a type of melon that often gets a bad rep. It is sometimes ignored in favor of other fruits, but it can be a helpful addition to the diet for people who have IBD. Honeydew has a smooth rind and a fleshy, light green interior. It has a mild taste and it is sweet when eaten alone but also makes a good addition to a fruit salad.
What makes honeydew a good choice for IBD is the fact that it is easily digestible and is also high in vitamin C. Honeydew won't continue to ripen on your counter or in the refrigerator if it has a green rind, so you've got to make your best choice of the melon while you're at the market. A ripe honeydew will have a rind that is somewhere between creamy white and golden yellow, with no green. The rind should give a little when pushed: it shouldn't be hard, and it shouldn't be mushy. Letting it stand for a few more days after buying it will make for a sweeter taste. Just don't let it go too long — it can get become overripe and develop an unappetizing texture.

  Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together.

  In the context of nutrition, a mineral is a chemical element required as an essential nutrient by organisms to perform functions necessary for life. However, the four major structural elements in the human body by weight (oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen), are usually not included in lists of major nutrient minerals (nitrogen is considered a "mineral" for plants, as it often is included in fertilizers). These four elements compose about 96% of the weight of the human body, and major minerals (macrominerals) and minor minerals (also called trace elements) compose the remainder. Nutrient minerals, being elements, cannot be synthesized biochemically by living organisms. Plants get minerals from soil. Most of the minerals in a human diet come

  this does not account for conversion losses and plant operating and capital costs which are significant. The raw materials can be as simple as corn stalks and scrap petroleum-based vehicle tires, but used tires are an expensive feedstock with other more-valuable uses. GM has over 4 million E85 cars on the road now, and by 2012 half of the production cars for the US will be capable of running on E85 fuel. But by 2012, the supply of ethanol will not even be close to supplying this much E85. Coskata Inc. is building two new plants for the ethanol fuel. Theoretically, the process is claimed to be five times more energy efficient than corn based ethanol, but it

  of water, is a very expensive and energy intensive. Hydrogen cars, either as hydrogen combustion or fuel cells, require the installation of new infrastructure for hydrogen production, transportation, storage, distribution, and vehicle refueling. The current gasoline infrastructure is designed to operate around a liquid fuel, not a gaseous fuel. Current vehicles are not designed to use hydrogen fuel, which would require existing cars to be retrofitted and future cars to be redesigned. Another option being considered is battery powered electric vehicles. Though they do not directly consume fossil fuels, they do rely on an external source to provide the necessary electricity, and the most widely used fuel for electricity generation is coal. As with hydrogen cars, current cars would

  are not currently cost-effective without significant subsidies. "America's ethanol program is a product of government subsidies. There are more than 200 different kinds, as well as a 54 cents-a-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. This prices Brazilian ethanol out of an otherwise competitive market. Brazil makes ethanol from sugarcane rather than corn (maize), which has a better EROEI.  Federal subsidies alone cost $7 billion a year (equal to around $1.90 a gallon)." General Motors is starting a project to produce E85 fuel from cellulose ethanol for a projected cost of 1 $/usgal. This is optimistic, because $1 per US gallon equates to 10 $/MMBtu which is comparable to woodchips at 7 $/MMBtu or firewood at 6 to 12 $/MMBtu,

  that food prices could rise and shortages might be experienced in some countries. Corn, wheat, and sugar beet can also require high agricultural inputs in the form of fertilizers, which limit the greenhouse gas reductions that can be achieved. Biodiesel produced by transesterification from rapeseed oil, palm oil, or other plant oils is also considered a first-generation biofuel. The goal of second-generation biofuel processes is to extend the amount of biofuel that can be produced sustainably by using biomass consisting of the residual non-food parts of current crops, such as stems, leaves and husks that are left behind once the food crop has been extracted, as well as other crops

 A few weeks later, I sat down with Dr. C in his office.Our first two appointments were with a young physician/fellow whom I'll call Dr. C. He conducted a thorough medical history and then, with the help of a senior attending physician, Dr. D, ordered a battery of tests.Only years later did we articulate our fears to each other: we both felt as if we were dying, and we were terrified for our children. Back on our case, Dr. B sent us to a gastrointestinal specialist who listened to us list our symptoms and told us that he thought we had a bacterial infection. I left a tearful message on Dr. B's voicemail, begging him to let us try antibiotics again. Reluctantly, he prescribed twenty days of doxycycline, the recommended antibiotic for treating early Lyme disease. It miraculously eliminated all our symptoms, but three weeks after the drugs ran out, neurological symptoms, old and new, hit us like a ton of bricks. Now, along with the same symptoms as before, it felt like we had Alzheimer's disease. Our short-term memory was seriously impaired, and I could no longer read. I would lose my shopping cart in the grocery store or get out of my car and leave the engine running. One day I found myself at a stoplight unable to remember what the red, yellow, and green lights meant. Rather than admit defeat, Dr. B decided that I was an attention-seeking, hysterical female whose husband was suffering from sympathy pains. He diagnosed us with "a psychosomatic couples thing." It was time to find a new doctor. I spent weeks pulling strings to get an appointment with another infectious disease specialist, this one at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Our first two appointments were with a young physician/fellow whom I'll call Dr. C. He conducted a thorough medical history and then, with the help of a senior attending physician, Dr. D, ordered a battery of tests. A few weeks later, I sat down with Dr. C in his office.When he closed the folder, I asked, "But what about the Lyme test?"He told us that the Lyme antibody screening test was positive for me and negative for my husband.He said that the positive didn't mean anything because it was an unreliable test, a "false positive."

The bear keeping track of the changing days allows it to awaken from hibernation at the appropriate time of year to conserve as much energy as possible. The hibernating American black bear does not display the same rate of muscle and bone atrophy relative to other nonhibernatory animals that are subject to long periods of inactivity due to ailment or old age. A hibernating American black bear loses approximately half the muscular strength compared to that of a well-nourished, inactive human. The bear's bone mass does not change in geometry or mineral composition during hibernation, which implies that the bear's

In Alaska, only 14–17% of subadult males and 30–48% of subadult females were found in a study to survive to adulthood. Across the range, the estimated number of cubs who survive past their first year is 60%. With the exception of the rare confrontation with an adult brown bear or a gray wolf pack, adult American black bears are not usually subject to natural predation. However, as evidenced by scats with fur inside of them and the recently discovered carcass

  of cougar kills in Yellowstone and Glacier National Parks, usurping 10% of the carcasses. Another study found that American black bears visited 48% of cougar kills in summer in Colorado and 77% of kills in California. As a result, the cats spend more time killing and less time feeding on each kill. American black bear interactions with gray wolves are much rarer than with brown bears, due to differences in habitat preferences. The majority of American black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Despite the American black bear being more powerful on a one-to-one basis, packs of wolves have been recorded to kill black bears

  The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is one of the most omnivorous animals in the world and has been recorded consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear. Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Certainly no other animal in their given ecosystems, short perhaps of other bear species and humans, can claim to feed on as broad a range of dietary opportunities. Food that is both abundant and easily obtained is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas

  forage for food. Females also give birth in February and nurture their cubs until the snow melts. During winter, American black bears consume 25–40% of their body weight. The footpads peel off while they sleep, making room for new tissue. Many of the physiological changes an American black bear exhibits during hibernation are retained slightly post-hibernation. Upon exiting hibernation, bears retain a reduced heart rate and basal metabolic rate. The metabolic rate of a hibernating bear will remain at a reduced level for up to 21 days after hibernation. After emerging from their winter dens in spring, they wander their home ranges for two weeks so that their metabolism accustoms itself

   Despite living in North America, American black bears are not closely related to brown bears and polar bears; genetic studies reveal that they split from a common ancestor 5.05 million years ago (mya). American and Asian black bears are considered sister taxa and are more closely related to each other than to the other modern species of bears. According to recent studies, the sun bear is also a relatively recent split from this lineage. A small primitive bear called Ursus abstrusus is the oldest known North American fossil member of the genus Ursus, dated to 4.95 mya. This suggests that

If such a bear was shot, the huntsman would offer it to yama no kami, and give up hunting from that time on. Similar beliefs were held in Nagano, where the completely black Asian black bears were termed nekoguma or cat-bear. Matagi communities believed that killing an Asian black bear in the mountains would result in a bad storm, which was linked to the belief that bear spirits could affect weather. The matagi would generally hunt Asian black bears in spring or from late autumn to early winter,

  Biologically and morphologically, Asian black bears represent the beginning of the arboreal specializations attained by sloth bears and sun bears. Asian black bears have karyotypes nearly identical to those of the five other ursine bears, and, as is typical in the genus, they have 74 chromosomes. From an evolutionary perspective, Asian black bears are the least changed of the Old World bears, with certain scientists arguing that it is likely that all other lineages of ursine bear stem from this species. Scientists have proposed that Asian black bears are either a surviving, albeit modified, form of Ursus etruscus, specifically the early, small variety of the Middle Villafranchian (Upper Pliocene to Lower Pleistocene) or a larger form of Ursus minimus, an extinct species that

During their time in hibernation, an American black bear's heart rate drops from 40 to 50 beats per minute to 8 beats per minute and the metabolic rate can drop to a quarter of the bear's (nonhibernating) basal metabolic rate (BMR). These reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate do not appear to decrease the bear's ability to heal injuries during hibernation. Their circadian rhythm stays intact during hibernation.

 Humans with echolocation abilities detect objects in their environment by actively creating sounds and sensing the echoes that bounce back from those objects. This is achieved through various methods such as tapping canes, lightly stomping their foot, snapping fingers, or making clicking noises with their mouths. By emitting these sounds and listening to the returning echoes, individuals trained in echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects.

Through this process, they are able to accurately identify the location and size of objects in their surroundings. The ability to perceive these echoes allows them to navigate and interact with their environment effectively.

Reference:
- Human echolocation is the ability of humans to detect objects in their environment by sensing echoes from those objects, by actively creating sounds: for example, by tapping their canes, lightly stomping their foot, snapping their fingers, or making clicking noises with their mouths. People trained to orient by echolocation can interpret the sound waves reflected by nearby objects, accurately identifying their location and size.

As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. Strong acids and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive, but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid. The second category of acids are Lewis acids, which form a covalent bond with an electron pair.

  In the wine/water mixing problem, one starts with two barrels, one holding wine and the other an equal volume of water. A cup of wine is taken from the wine barrel and added to the water. A cup of the wine/water mixture is then returned to the wine barrel, so that the volumes in the barrels are again equal. The question is then posed—which of the two mixtures is purer? The answer is that the mixtures will be of equal purity. The solution still applies no matter how many cups of any sizes and compositions are exchanged, or how little or much stirring at any point in time is done to any barrel, as long as at the end each barrel has the same amount of liquid. The problem can be solved with logic and without resorting to computation. It is not necessary to state the volumes of wine and water, as long as they are equal. The volume of the cup is irrelevant, as is any stirring of the mixtures.

  Water hydrates the grains and enables fermentation. The pH and mineral content of the water also contribute to the flavor and quality of the drink. Many regions are famous not only for their alcoholic beverages but also for the flavor and quality of their water sources. Emphasis is placed on gathering the cleanest water directly from springs or streams or from the center of lakes, where the water has been exposed to the least amount of pollutants. Water should be low in iron and sodium, with a higher proportion of magnesium and calcium ions as part of its total mineral content.

  thermal shock, being able to survive immersion in water while red hot, its high melting temperature (1723 °C) and viscosity make it difficult to work with. Other substances are therefore added to simplify processing. One is the "soda", or sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), which lowers the glass-transition temperature. However, the soda makes the glass water-soluble, which is usually undesirable. To provide for better chemical durability, the "lime" is also added. This is calcium oxide (CaO), generally obtained from limestone. In addition, magnesium oxide (MgO) and alumina, which is aluminium oxide (Al2O3), contribute to the durability. The resulting glass contains about 70 to 74% silica by weight.

Again pour the oats with water and boil until a white broth, drain, and take inside.
After the grain is unsuitable for treatment, the preparation scheme should be repeated.
Drink broth for a week.
During treatment with the oatmeal of the thyroid gland, it is allowed to take 1 cup of tea or milk during the day, and exclude other drinks. It is useful to expand the diet of seafood, fish.
In rare cases, infusions and otters can cause individual intolerance. An overdose can cause headache.
Oats do not contain important microelements, which must necessarily enter the body. A prolonged oat diet can cause their deficiency.
Oats in some cases have a bad effect on teeth.

But a bacterial infection like strep throat (from streptococcus) often comes on suddenly, accompanied by swollen glands and fever. Throat irritation from smoking, dry heat, postnasal drip, or an allergic reaction can also cause soreness. ### Get Gargling

• For fast and effective relief, nothing beats an old-fashioned saltwater gargle. Salt acts as a mild antiseptic, and also draws water out of mucous membranes in the throat, which helps to clear phlegm. Dissolve a half-teaspoon salt in a glass of warm water, gargle, and spit out. Repeat up to four times a day. • For a spicier gargle, substitute a few drops of Tabasco sauce for salt. • Alternatively, gargle with a baking-soda solution. Dissolve one-half teaspoon of baking soda in a glass of warm water. ### Tonight, Honey

• Honey has long been used as a sore-throat remedy. It has antibacterial properties, which can help speed healing. It also acts as a hypertonic osmotic, which means that it draws water out of inflamed tissue. This reduces the swelling and discomfort. Add several teaspoons to 1 cup of hot water or herbal tea. • Hot lemonade with honey can also relieve pain. Combine the juice of half a lemon with hot water. ### Capital Teas

• Horehound reduces the swelling of inflamed throat tissue. It also thins mucus, which makes it easier for you to clear it from your throat. To make the tea, steep 2 teaspoons chopped herb in 1 cup boiling water for 10 minutes; strain and drink. • Slippery elm contains mucilage that coats the throat and eases the soreness. Steep 1 teaspoon of the inner bark in 2 cups boiling water, strain, and drink.To make the tea, steep 2 teaspoons dried herb in 1 cup boiling water for 10 minutes; strain and drink.Drink three to five cups a day.### Throw Down the Gullet

• Take 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C three times a day.Whether your sore throat is caused by a cold, the flu, or strep, this vitamin will help boost your immune system and fight off infection.Reduce the dose if you develop diarrhea.

There are many possible causes for that frog in your throat: Strained vocal chords, excessively dry ambient air or a viral infection, to name just a few. Resting your vocal chords may be all that is needed, so speak softly and as little as possible. In addition, an array of simple remedies can speed up the healing process. If there is no improvement, you should consult a doctor. • Hot tea of any kind can soothe a sore throat, especially sage tea, which should ideally be made fresh every time from dried sage leaves. Warm elderberry tea also alleviates discomfort. • If your mother treated your sore throat with a soothing mug of hot milk and honey, she was spot on. Drinking this beverage several times a day will ease hoarseness quickly. • A potato wrap speeds healing. Boil, peel and mash 2–3 potatoes.Wear the wrap and scarf until the potatoes cool down.Repeat three times a day.• Make a refreshing throat compress by soaking a tightly woven cloth in warm thyme, sage or meadowsweet tea.Gently wring out the cloth and wrap it around your throat, then cover it with a woolen scarf.• Add a few drops of either lavender or eucalyptus essential oil to 1 cup (250 ml) boiling water.

 Some natural treatments that can help relieve symptoms and speed up recovery from a cold include:

1. Saltwater gargle: Dissolve 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt in an 8-ounce glass of warm water and gargle several times a day. This can provide relief to a dry or scratchy throat.

2. Getting plenty of rest: When you have a cold, it's important to stay home and rest. Getting adequate sleep allows your body to focus on fighting off the infection and promotes faster recovery.

3. Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal tea, and clear broths. This helps to keep your respiratory system hydrated and loosens mucus, making it easier to clear congestion.

4. Nasal irrigation: Using a saline nasal rinse or spray can help relieve nasal congestion and promote drainage. This can be especially beneficial for alleviating sinus congestion.

5. Steam inhalation: Inhaling steam from a hot shower or a bowl of hot water can help soothe nasal and throat irritation, reduce congestion, and provide temporary relief from cold symptoms.

6. Honey and warm beverages: Consuming warm beverages like tea or warm water mixed with honey can help soothe a sore throat and provide temporary relief from coughing.

It's important to note that while these natural treatments can provide symptom relief and support recovery, there is no cure for the common cold. If symptoms persist or worsen, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate medical advice and treatment.

After being heated to incandescence for a few hours, carbon from the filament would be deposited on the inside walls of the bulb, turning it black. Hammer noticed the carbon seemed to be coming from the end of the filament that was attached to the negative terminal of the DC power supply, and seemed to be flying through the vacuum onto the walls of the bulb, a phenomenon that Edison observed in 1875. On February 13, 1880, Edison determined that not only was carbon flying through the vacuum, but that it carried a charge. That is,

During the midst of the smallpox outbreak, Jesty transferred pieces of cow udder which he knew had been infected with cowpox into the skin of his family members in the hopes of protecting them. Jesty did not publicize his findings, and Jenner, who performed his first inoculation 22 years later and publicized his findings, assumed credit. It is said that Jenner made this discovery by himself, possibly without knowing previous accounts 20 years earlier. Although Jesty may have been the first to discover it, Jenner made vaccination widely accessible and has therefore been credited for its invention.

The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage. After sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s.

The company's publications gradually extended over the entire field of literature. It issued the works of contemporary scientists at moderate prices, for example, Herbert Spencer, John Tyndall, Thomas Huxley, Charles Darwin, etc. Medical books formed a special department, and books in the Spanish language for the South American market were a specialty which the firm made its own. In belles lettres and American history, it had a strong list of names among its authors.

In the domain of plant chemistry, Braconnot contributed to the isolation and the description of several compounds, most of which were shown later to be mixtures of simpler products. Among others, Braconnot discovered gallic and ellagic acids (1818) and pyrogallic acid (pyrogallol) which later enabled the development of photography. He discovered also in 1811 chitin in mushrooms, the earliest known polysaccharide. In 1819, he published a memoir describing for the first time the conversion of wood, straw or cotton into a sugar

Most recognized for inventing the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the electric light bulb, Edison's contributions to electrochemistry were monumental. ; John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham, and Akira Yoshino, all long time ECS members, shared the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry “for the development of lithium-ion batteries”. ; Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura shared the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physics for “the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes, which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources”. ; Jack Kilby’s invention of the integrated

  was flowing not only through the filament but also through the evacuated bulb, a phenomenon initially reported in 1873 by Frederick Guthrie in Britain. In order to measure this flow, he made a special bulb with a third electrode, to which he could attach an instrument to measure the current. He reasoned that if the current would flow between the two ends of the filament, it would also flow to this third electrode. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments.

He foresaw the potential of inventions such as the Marconi wireless telegraph, the telephone, the phonograph, the trolley car, and the automobile; "to all of these he gave of his time, his money and his judgment, to aid in their development." Thomas Edison, inventor of the light bulb, was financed and supported by Trask. For over 14 years he was president of the New York Edison Company, the world's first electric power company. The company became known as Consolidated Edison. Trask was an original trustee of the Edison Electric Light Company, the predecessor to the General Electric Company, being for many years a member of the executive committee.

The pasteurization process was developed in 1864 by French scientist Louis Pasteur, who discovered that heating beer and wine was enough to kill most of the bacteria that caused spoilage, preventing these beverages from turning sour. The process achieves this by eliminating pathogenic microbes and lowering microbial numbers to prolong the quality of the beverage. After sufficient scientific study led to the development of germ theory, pasteurization was introduced in the United States in the 1890s.

In order to measure this flow, he made a special bulb with a third electrode, to which he could attach an instrument to measure the current. He reasoned that if the current would flow between the two ends of the filament, it would also flow to this third electrode. While he was proven to be right about the current flow, Edison could not explain it, and the third electrode did not prevent blackening of the bulb, so he moved on to other experiments.

   One of the key realizations made by cosmologists in the 1970s and 1980s was that the majority of the matter content of the universe was composed not of atoms, but rather a mysterious form of matter known as dark matter. Dark matter interacts through the force of gravity, but it is not composed of baryons, and it is known with very high accuracy that it does not emit or absorb radiation. It may be composed of particles that interact through the weak interaction, such as neutrinos, but it cannot be composed entirely of the three known kinds of neutrinos (although some have suggested it is a

  An atom is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics—as if they were tennis balls, for example—is not possible due to quantum effects. Every atom is composed of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made of one or more protons and a number of neutrons. Only the most common variety of hydrogen has no neutrons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have

  For example, a positron (the antiparticle of the electron) and an antiproton (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom. The nuclei of antihelium have been artificially produced, albeit with difficulty, and are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements. There is strong evidence that the observable universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, as opposed to an equal mixture of matter and antimatter. This asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. The process by which this inequality between matter and antimatter particles developed is called baryogenesis.

  (the one that occurs in matter usually interacted with in daily life). The other (usually given the prefix "anti-") is designated the antiparticle. Particle–antiparticle pairs can annihilate each other, producing photons; since the charges of the particle and antiparticle are opposite, total charge is conserved. For example, the positrons produced in natural radioactive decay quickly annihilate themselves with electrons, producing pairs of gamma rays, a process exploited in positron emission tomography. The laws of nature are very nearly symmetrical with respect to particles and antiparticles. For example, an antiproton and a positron can form an antihydrogen atom, which is believed to have the

   In modern physics, antimatter is defined as matter composed of the antiparticles (or "partners") of the corresponding particles in "ordinary" matter. Minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at particle accelerators—total artificial production has been only a few nanograms —and in natural processes like cosmic ray collisions and some types of radioactive decay, but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form antiatoms. No macroscopic amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling. Theoretically, a particle and its antiparticle (for example, a proton and an antiproton) have the same mass, but opposite electric charge, and other differences in quantum numbers. For example, a proton has

  properties as a hydrogen atom. This leads to the question of why the formation of matter after the Big Bang resulted in a universe consisting almost entirely of matter, rather than being a half-and-half mixture of matter and antimatter. The discovery of charge parity violation helped to shed light on this problem by showing that this symmetry, originally thought to be perfect, was only approximate. Because charge is conserved, it is not possible to create an antiparticle without either destroying another particle of the same charge (as is for instance the case when antiparticles are produced naturally via beta decay or the

  such as crystals. Allotropy refers only to different forms of an element within the same physical phase (the state of matter, such as a solid, liquid or gas). The differences between these states of matter would not alone constitute examples of allotropy. Allotropes of chemical elements are frequently referred to as polymorphs or as phases of the element. For some elements, allotropes have different molecular formulae or different crystalline structures, as well as a difference in physical phase; for example, two allotropes of oxygen (dioxygen, O2, and ozone, O3) can both exist in the solid, liquid and gaseous states. Other elements do not maintain distinct allotropes in different physical phases; for example, phosphorus has numerous solid allotropes, which all revert to the same P4 form when melted to the liquid state.

  D.L. Hawkins has the ability to phase through solid matter, though it has not been confirmed whether he is able to perform this whilst through liquid or gas matter. When he is phasing through something, its surface will warp slightly, like a liquid in slow-motion. D.L. can phase specific parts of his body, such as phasing his arm through a door to unlock it from the opposite side. D. L. can also phase others as long as they remain in physical contact, though his passengers generally experience discomfort. As evidenced by his threat to Jessica, D. L. is able to revert his passengers to their corporeal state before successfully moving their bodies out of the solid matter - though whether it would be fatal is unknown. He can also

   A microscope slide is a thin flat piece of glass, typically 75 by 26 mm (3 by 1 inches) and about 1 mm thick, used to hold objects for examination under a microscope. Typically the object is mounted (secured) on the slide, and then both are inserted together in the microscope for viewing. This arrangement allows several slide-mounted objects to be quickly inserted and removed from the microscope, labeled, transported, and stored in appropriate slide cases or folders etc. Microscope slides are often used together with a cover slip or cover glass, a smaller and thinner sheet of glass that is placed over the specimen. Slides are held in place on the microscope's stage by slide clips, slide clamps or a cross-table which is used to achieve precise, remote movement of the slide upon the microscope's stage (such as in an automated/computer operated system, or where touching the slide with fingers is inappropriate either due to the risk of contamination or lack of precision).

  The stage of an inverted microscope is usually fixed, and focus is adjusted by moving the objective lens along a vertical axis to bring it closer to or further from the specimen. The focus mechanism typically has a dual concentric knob for coarse and fine adjustment. Depending on the size of the microscope, four to six objective lenses of different magnifications may be fitted to a rotating turret known as a nosepiece. These microscopes may also be fitted with accessories for fitting still and video cameras, fluorescence illumination, confocal scanning and many other applications.

   The smallest organisms found on Earth can be determined according to various aspects of organism size, including volume, mass, height, length, or genome size. Given the incomplete nature of scientific knowledge, it is possible that the smallest organism is undiscovered. Furthermore, there is some debate over the definition of life, and what entities qualify as organisms; consequently the smallest known organism (microorganism) is debatable.

## **Disorders of Organelles**

**CHAPTER SUMMARY**

The functions of cell organelles like the nucleus and mitochondria are critical to the processes on which life depends. But that does not mean they are easy to study. From a general biology course you probably learned facts like a nucleus controls the growth and reproduction of a cell and ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis (Figure 13-1). But for a moment, take a step back and ask a more basic question, "How do we know these things?" Just seeing the microscopic structures inside a cell is hard enough. How can we know the way they actually work? For medical genetics, the next question is then obvious. What are the medical effects of a genetic change in the structure or activity of a cell organelle? Can that knowledge lead to appropriate treatment? **Figure 13-1**. Electron microscopy opens cell ultrastructure to a world of detail that could not be imagined by early researchers. But seeing structure does not always explain function. (Reprinted with permission from Cheville, N., _Ultrastructural Pathology_ , Iowa State University Press, Ames, IA. p 2, 1994.)The real champion is how human ingenuity can figure out a process, especially a small, elusive one hidden somewhere in the complexity of the body—or of a cell.Let's step back in history to remind ourselves of both the limitations and the scientific revolutions that have been spurred by experimentation at the level of a cell.

 With thousands of human beings successfully using a variety of stem cell therapies and getting positive results, we can be assured that under proper conditions stem cell therapy is safe.
Safety is a main concern in stem cell therapy. This therapy consists of putting a substance in the form of capsule or solution into the body. Once inside or inserted into the body, the substance is hard to control.
Why is stem cell therapy often compared with the hepatitis B virus?
They are similar in some aspects. Both are foreign bodies. Both make changes in the body causing it to react.
However, they are different. Hepatitis B virus makes you sick. Stem cell therapy heals you.
“Virus” is plural; “virion” is singular. Hepatitis is a disease that consists mainly of inflammation of the liver. Major complications are cirrhosis (scarring of the liver) and liver cancer. Some symptoms of hepatitis are fatigue, stomach pain, jaundice, and loss of appetite.
There are several kinds of hepatitis: Hepatitis A is caused by the hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B is from the hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C from the hepatitis C virus, hepatitis D from the hepatitis D virus, and hepatitis E is caused by hepatitis E virus.
Virus are of two kinds: DNA virus and RNA virus. DNA means deoxyribonucleic acid that makes up the hereditary material of humans and plants. It contains the information code that controls how a human being looks, thinks, and acts. RNA means ribonucleic acid, a messenger that transmits the information code in the making of protein.
You might compare the making of a body to the construction of a house — similar to house plans given to the carpenters who use them to build a house.
Our body is mostly made up of protein. Muscles have protein, as do blood, brain, and nerves. DNA and RNA work together in making a human being. DNA contains the plan of a human being; RNA delivers the plan that serves as guide in making the components of a human being. A virion is neither living nor dead, according to what we believe a living thing is. It is not even a cell. However, it becomes alive when it attaches to a host, like a human being, pig, or fowl. That is, when it attaches to and enters a cell of a living host, it then activates.
Hepatitis B is a DNA viron. It is a very small thing that cannot be seen by the ordinary microscope. Its size and shape can be detected with the help of a powerful microscope called electron microscope.
Hepatitis B virion is transmitted to a person by means of blood and body fluid or both. A small amount of blood is enough to cause hepatitis B. A syringe used on a person with hepatitis B can transmit the virion to another person who is injected with the same syringe. Even a nail clipper can transmit hepa B virus. Sexual acts can transmit hepa B virus, too.
When a hepa B virion lands in a human cell, it looks for a hole in the cell that matches its size and shape. A human cell may have 500 to many thousands of holes. Although it doesn’t fit the definition of something that is alive, the virion actually is a different form of life or at least acts that way, as is shown by its search for a hole. Once it finds a matching hole, the virion gets inside the cell and “looks for” (in layman’s terms) the nucleus that contains the hereditary material, among other things. That material is the chromosome made up of several DNA and RNA. A human being has 46 chromosomes. A chromosome is like a bean pod that is two inches long. Chromosomes can be seen in a patch of blood or saliva by the ordinary microscope.
A chromosome is made of genes like the seeds of a bean pod. A viral chromosome may have 5 to 10 genes. The chromosomes of a human being contains 3 trillion genes, according the Human Genome Project (Internet, Oct. 6, 2013).
Once inside the nucleus of a human cell, the virion inserts itself into the chromosomes. So now the infected human being has 3 trillion plus 10 genes. That is one kind of change the hepatitis B virion makes on the human being – it increases the number of its genes.
Hepa B virus favor the liver cells because these contain a lot of folic acid (a B-complex vitamin) that are components of new cells. Without folic acid, no new cells can be made. The hepa B virion needs it to be able to multiply or replicate into thousands then millions of new virus. We say that the virion parasitizes (becomes a parasite on) the liver cell. A virion duplicates its population every 20 minutes, which is why infection with hepatitis occurs so rapidly.
A human cell onto whose one chromosome a hepatitis virion has inserted itself is virtually a hepatitis virion. This one infected cell duplicates its chromosomes and produces two sets of new chromosomes containing viral genes. The two sets of chromosomes form two daughter cells that are virtually virus. These virus infect neighboring healthy human cells that will also turn into virtual virus.
To summarize, the hepatitis virion looks for a hole in a human cell. It inserts its genes into a chromosome of this cell. When the cell produces new cells, the virion likewise replicates. Parasitizing the liver, hepatitis B causes inflammation that may result in cirrhosis or liver cancer.
When given to a patient, stem cells from plants trigger the native stem cells to multiply and differentiate. Plant stem cells do not insert their genes into the person’s chromosomes. That is why someone given plant stem cells will not grow leaves or bark.
While the hepatitis B virus cause hepatitis B, stem cells from plants cause healing in a person afflicted with degenerative disorders like arthritis, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, Parkinson’s disease, autism, and many more diseases and afflictions.
With so many similarities, you can see why it is important to understand the differences between stem cell therapy and hepatitis B virus and how stem cell therapy is also clearly safer.

  Dissections become threatening to the health of the organism when growth of the false lumen prevents perfusion of the true lumen and the end organs perfused by the true lumen. For example, in an aortic dissection, if the left subclavian artery orifice were distal to the origin of the dissection, then the left subclavian would be said to be perfused by the false lumen, while the left common carotid (and its end organ, the left hemisphere of the brain) if proximal to the dissection, would be perfused by the true lumen proximal to the dissection.

 ProHSN is a supplement that supports healthy hair, skin, and nails. It contains various vitamins and minerals that provide several functions and benefits. 

One of the key vitamins in ProHSN is vitamin C. Vitamin C is necessary for the synthesis of collagen and glycosaminoglycans, which are essential for the structure and health of connective tissues like skin, blood vessels, tendons, joint cartilage, and bone. It is also crucial for wound healing and maintaining capillary health. Additionally, vitamin C participates in the synthesis of carnitine, serotonin, and certain neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine. It is known for its powerful antioxidant properties, protecting against harmful free radicals. 

Another important vitamin found in ProHSN is vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for vision, growth, reproduction, cell division, and the integrity of the immune system. It plays a vital role in maintaining healthy skin, as well as promoting the growth and development of hair and nails.

ProHSN also contains minerals that have crucial functions in the body. Calcium, for example, is the primary mineral component of bone and is essential for maintaining healthy bone structure and function. It also plays a role in blood clotting, nerve conduction, and muscle contraction. Magnesium is involved in energy metabolism and is particularly important for the heart, skeletal muscles, and nervous system. Manganese is necessary for antioxidant systems, bone growth, fat metabolism, and the synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and cartilage. Zinc is important for growth, immune system function, protein synthesis, antioxidant mechanisms, and wound healing.

In summary, ProHSN provides a combination of vitamins and minerals that contribute to healthy hair, skin, and nails. The included vitamins, such as vitamin C and vitamin A, have various functions in the body, including collagen synthesis, wound healing, antioxidant protection, and maintaining immune system integrity. The minerals in ProHSN, like calcium, magnesium, manganese, and zinc, play important roles in bone health, energy metabolism, antioxidant systems, and overall well-being.

 The different physiological systems of the human body that are classified in medical textbooks are as follows:

1. Integumentary System: This system includes the skin, hair, nails, and sweat glands. It serves as a protective barrier for the body and regulates temperature.

2. Muscular System: This system consists of muscles that provide movement, stability, and support for the body. There are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.

3. Skeletal System: The skeletal system is composed of bones, joints, and connective tissues. It provides support, protection, and structure to the body, as well as allowing for movement.

4. Neurological System: The neurological system includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It controls and coordinates the body's activities, processes sensory information, and enables communication between body parts.

5. Endocrine System: This system is responsible for producing and secreting hormones that regulate various bodily functions. It includes glands such as the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands.

6. Cardiovascular/Circulatory System: The cardiovascular system comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood. It transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.

7. Respiratory System: This system involves the lungs, airways, and respiratory muscles. Its main function is to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment.

8. Gastrointestinal System: The gastrointestinal system, also known as the digestive system, includes organs such as the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. It is responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients.

9. Lymphatic System: The lymphatic system consists of lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and lymphoid organs. It plays a crucial role in the body's immune response and fluid balance.

10. Hematological System: This system involves the blood, blood cells, and bone marrow. It is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and immune cells throughout the body.

11. Urological/Renal/Urinary System: The urinary system includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. It filters waste products from the blood and helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.

12. Reproductive System: The reproductive system is responsible for the production of gametes (sperm and eggs) and the development of offspring. It includes organs such as the ovaries, uterus, testes, and penis.

In medical textbooks, these physiological systems are often classified separately, as diseases and disorders are studied and categorized according to the system they affect. This allows for a specialized approach in understanding and treating specific medical conditions. Each system is also associated with a medical specialty, indicated by the suffix "-ology." For example, endocrinology is the specialty devoted to diseases of the endocrine system.

 3 -0.43761 The different physiological systems of the human body that are classified in medical textbooks are as follows:

1. Integumentary System: This system includes the skin, hair, nails, and sweat glands. It serves as a protective barrier for the body and regulates temperature.

2. Muscular System: This system consists of muscles that provide movement, stability, and support for the body. There are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac.

3. Skeletal System: The skeletal system is composed of bones, joints, and connective tissues. It provides support, protection, and structure to the body, as well as allowing for movement.

4. Neurological System: The neurological system includes the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It controls and coordinates the body's activities, processes sensory information, and enables communication between body parts.

5. Endocrine System: This system is responsible for producing and secreting hormones that regulate various bodily functions. It includes glands such as the thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary glands.

6. Cardiovascular/Circulatory System: The cardiovascular system comprises the heart, blood vessels, and blood. It transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body.

7. Respiratory System: This system involves the lungs, airways, and respiratory muscles. Its main function is to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide between the body and the environment.

8. Gastrointestinal System: The gastrointestinal system, also known as the digestive system, includes organs such as the stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. It is responsible for the digestion and absorption of nutrients.

9. Lymphatic System: The lymphatic system consists of lymph nodes, lymphatic vessels, and lymphoid organs. It plays a crucial role in the body's immune response and fluid balance.

10. Hematological System: This system involves the blood, blood cells, and bone marrow. It is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and immune cells throughout the body.

11. Urological/Renal/Urinary System: The urinary system includes the kidneys, bladder, ureters, and urethra. It filters waste products from the blood and helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance.

12. Reproductive System: The reproductive system is responsible for the production of gametes (sperm and eggs) and the development of offspring. It includes organs such as the ovaries, uterus, testes, and penis.

In medical textbooks, these physiological systems are often classified separately, as diseases and disorders are studied and categorized according to the system they affect. This allows for a specialized approach in understanding and treating specific medical conditions. Each system is also associated with a medical specialty, indicated by the suffix "-ology." For example, endocrinology is the specialty devoted to diseases of the endocrine system.
 4 -0.69108  Dissections become threatening to the health of the organism when growth of the false lumen prevents perfusion of the true lumen and the end organs perfused by the true lumen. For example, in an aortic dissection, if the left subclavian artery orifice were distal to the origin of the dissection, then the left subclavian would be said to be perfused by the false lumen, while the left common carotid (and its end organ, the left hemisphere of the brain) if proximal to the dissection, would be perfused by the true lumen proximal to the dissection.  Vessels and organs that are perfused from a false

Some specific systems studied in human anatomy include the respiratory system, digestive system, cardiovascular system, urinary system, integumentary system, skeletal system, endocrine system, lymphatic system, and immune system. The digestive system is responsible for digestion and processing food, and includes structures like the salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, rectum, and anus. The integumentary system includes the skin, hair, fat, and nails, serving as a protective barrier for the body. The structural support and protection of the body is provided by the skeletal system, which includes bones, cartilage, ligaments, and tendons. Finally, the immune system plays a vital role in protecting the body against infections and diseases. It involves the development of antibodies and immune responses. These systems are extensively studied in human anatomy and are also present in many other animals. Reference:

  Spontaneous abortion occurs in various animals. For example, in sheep it may be caused by stress or physical exertion, such as crowding through doors or being chased by dogs. In cows, abortion may be caused by contagious disease, such as brucellosis or Campylobacter, but can often be controlled by vaccination. Eating pine needles can also induce abortions in cows. Several plants, including broomweed, skunk cabbage, poison hemlock, and tree tobacco, are known to cause fetal deformities and abortion in cattle and in sheep and goats. In horses, a fetus may be aborted or resorbed if it has lethal white syndrome (congenital intestinal aganglionosis). Foal embryos that are homozygous for the dominant white gene (WW) are theorized to also be aborted or resorbed before birth. In many species of sharks and rays, stress-induced abortions occur frequently on capture. Viral infection can cause abortion in

In mammals, the process is initiated by hormones which cause the muscular walls of the uterus to contract, expelling the fetus at a developmental stage when it is ready to feed and breathe. Commonly considered the beginning of one's life. "First you are born, then you live life, then you die." ; De-extinction – process of creating an organism, which is a member of or resembles an extinct species, or a breeding population of such organisms. Cloning is the most widely proposed method, although selective breeding has also been proposed. Similar techniques have been applied to endangered species.

  has been a drop in births that cannot be explained solely by the numbers of females preyed upon each year by wolves. A “large decline in pregnancy rates” was detected when the effort was put forth to figure out another possible cause for the decline in population size. This is also supported by the fact that most calves up to six months old are sufficiently protected by their mother and the herd and are not killed by predators. This was shown in one study, where newborn calves were radio-collared and by six months of age they were still alive and healthy. Since the

A foundling wheel was a cylinder set upright in the outside wall of the building, rather like a revolving door. Mothers placed the child in the cylinder, turned it around so that the baby was inside the church, and then rang a bell to alert caretakers.

  A queen told an old woman that she had two griefs: a new one, that her husband was at war, and an old one, that they had no children. She gave her a basket with an egg: the queen was to put it somewhere warm. In three months, it would break and let out a doll. She was to let it alone, and then it would become a baby girl. She would have a baby of her own, a son, and she was to put the girl with him and show them both to the king, and then raise the son herself but entrust

During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides. Giraffe gestation lasts 400–460 days, after which a single calf is normally born, although twins occur on rare occasions. The mother gives birth standing up. The calf emerges head and front legs first, having broken through the fetal membranes, and falls to the ground, severing the umbilical cord. A newborn giraffe is 1.7 - 2 m tall. Within a

  teaching of basic statistics as an example to highlight that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation. The child-bringing myth has appeared in different forms in history. Children of African American slaves were sometimes told that white babies were brought by storks, while black babies were born from buzzard eggs. Psychoanalyst Marvin Margolis suggests the enduring nature of the stork fable of the newborn is linked to its addressing a psychological need, in that it allays the discomfort of discussing sex and procreation with children. Birds have long been associated with the maternal symbols from pagan goddesses such as Juno to the Holy Ghost, and the stork may

 There is much controversy surrounding the safety of VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarean), so much so that some hospitals are now refusing to admit women requesting this type of birth. A lot of hospitals and birthing centers started dropping their VBAC practices soon after the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a 1999 bulletin urging doctors to only perform a VBAC in a setting where proper emergency care is available.
According to an article published in the American Academy of Family Physicians (http://www.aafp.org/afp/990915ap/special.html) the ACOG still promotes the inclusion of VBAC as a birthing option, but it also takes the stance that no current or past study has proven that maternal and neonatal outcomes are better with VBAC than with repeat cesarean.
- One or two previous low-transverse cesarean deliveries.
- No other uterine scars or previous rupture.
- Physician immediately available throughout active labor capable of monitoring labor and performing an emergency cesarean delivery.
- Availability of anesthesia and personnel for emergency cesarean delivery.
One popular 2001 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/short/345/1/3) concluded that women who chose to have a VBAC were at a higher risk of uterine rupture than those women who had planned cesarean deliveries. The study goes on to say that women who were induced using a prostaglandin (a cervical ripening agent) before their VBAC were at a much greater risk of rupture.
These findings, however, are very controversial because they only focus on uterine rupture. For example, the risks of having a second cesarean alone can range from severe infection to subsequent infertility. The findings give no information about other risks of cesareans versus VBAC.
The wide range of conflicting research, studies, and recommendations only add to the confusion of making such an important decision.
After doing the research then sitting down with physician and family, how does a woman decide?
Do you think doctors and hospitals should be required to perform VBAC if a woman has chosen it as her birthing option and is a viable candidate for the procedure?
As woman who has had four successful VBAC's after a ceseaean, I would have to encourage other women in this situation to try to find a dr who would at least be willing to allow them to attempt a VBAC.
I was very aware with each of my VBAC's that at any point if my Dr. felt a c-section was necessary that I would be taken to surgery.
Commnuncation between mother and Dr. is key!
It is definitely a decision everyone would have to make on their own. If it were me I would want to take no chances. I would just have another caesarean. It wouldn't be worth the possible risk to have a natural birth and either way I would have a beautiful healthy baby at the end of it all and that's the important part.
I think that with any medical care Dr./Patient communication is VITAL. Dr.s need to lay all of their concerns on the table and have the right 'plan B' in place with the patience understanding that if an emergancy were to come into play the Dr. can go to 'plan B'. However, the ultimate decision is the patients. I had a very successful vaginal birth with twins and understand the joy of giving birth, but also knew that at any moment my doctor could choose a c-section for the babies safety. An OB's job isn't just to protect the mother, it is to protect the child..
I attempted a VBAC after my first baby because I wanted to experience a natural birth and the caesaren was done because I had been in labor for 24hrs and never progressed past 6cm. It was important for me to at least try(didn't work) and my doctor understood that and actually encouraged it. I'm with the other women who believe that open communication with your Dr. is important. When I found out I was pregnant, the 2nd time, VBAC was one of the first things we discussed. Every situation is different and there may be medical reasons that your doctor feels strongly about, which supports his decision not to approve a VBAC. Everyone should approach the situation with an open mind to ensure that the BEST decision is made.
I think that it should be up to the mother. I had my first child by cesarean due to not being able to dilate all the way but with my second child i tried VBAC but ended up not being able to dilate again i was in labor for a long time and ended up doing a caesarean, But i think that trying to do the VBAC after my first child was born was worth it even though i had to have the caesarean. As long as the baby isn't compromised it should be the mothers choice.
I had to have a cesarean too with my first born this past April. I was set to give birth vaginally, but after 20 hours of labor, the baby wasn't budging, his heartrate kept going up and down, the dr talked c-section and that's what we did. I was glad too for my baby's safety. I don't think I will take the risk of a VBAC and have a c-section again the next time around. I agree, it should be a decision left for the mother. We know our bodies and what they can handle. It's kind of weird, but I had a feeling that I would end up having a cesarean birth and I did.
Ladies we must all remember that no matter how your child arrives into this world, VBAC or C-section, the outcome is the same...we become mothers to a precious gift. I had an emergency C-section with my first child due to complications at 25 weeks. When i became pregnant w/ my 2nd i wanted a VBAC be/c i thought i had missed out on a rite of passage. LABOR. Every week for 32 weeks after i found out i was pregnant i had to be seen by the Dr and every week we discussed it-VBAC. In the end we scehduled an appt at 38 weeks to deliver my son. I never experienced my water breaking, labor pains, or yelling at my husband for doing this to me. Instead the day before my mom and I had a mother -daughter day at the Spa. I got my hair and nails done and a massage. The next day we took our kids (i have 2 stepsons and a girl) to stay with friends while my mom and hubby took me to the hospital. we unpacked and got settled. we were wheeled in, a local anesthetic was given and out he came. Half an hour later he was in my arms in my room. After it was all said in done, it didn't matter. My children were born and the only thing on my mind after that was enjoying them. But that is my story. Discussing with your doctor your capabilities and the risks to you and your child are key. Every woman is different and what may work for one may not necessarily work for another.
The reason the docs are so uptight about vbac is a missed diagnose or report by nurse of uterine rupture in its early stage..which doesn't last long, before it is deadly. I have had 2 c-sections, which were medically necesary: first one due to my cervix closing after dialation...second one due to a twin delivery with large twins. I think that before taking the risk, we should just ask why we want to go that way? Is it for the experience? Is it to compensate for that slight twinge of guilt that we feel for not delivering aux natural? Because both of these reasons are less important that the safest possible delivery of our babies, and the saving of our lives. There are lots of pains during labor. I pain in the side during a contraction that could be guesses as adhesions, just might be your babie's head popping out the side of your uterus, on the inside of your belly. I personally, don't feel comfortable taking this chance and I understand how a doctor wouldn't either.
I had my first son via c-section, after 30 hours of labor. I really hated that. I pushed and tried, unmedicated, until they told me it was no longer safe for my son. Then I agreed to the procedure. I believe I actually mourned the fact that I could not birth my own child. 14 months later I was happily pregnant again. I searched low and high to find a dr. who would allow me to do v-bac. I was elated. Then at 23 wks, I found out I was having twins. My dr. backed out of the v-bac. No one else would take me. Short of having an unattended home birth, I had no other choice but to have another c-section. I knew that this would be my last pregnancy and my last chance for what I felt was a real birth. I will never be at peace with the fact that I had no choice of my own. I was forced into something that I didn't want or need. I feel like it is sheer laziness on the dr.'s part. He would have to be in the room doing his job for more than the average birth, and this is just asking to much. I hope in the future that this changes. It is a very unfair practice to deny a natural birth to any mother who feels like it is what she needs to do.
I had my only daughter via Emergency C-Section, and I'm planing on having one more child in the next couple of years, my choice this time it's a C-Section, I don't want to take chances or risk my health/life and my baby's life.

Temperature rise is also affected by climate feedbacks such as the loss of sunlight-reflecting snow cover, and the release of carbon dioxide from drought-stricken forests. Collectively, these amplify global warming. On land, temperatures have risen about twice as fast as the global average. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms and other weather extremes.

Some communities may adapt to climate change through better coastline protection, disaster management, and development of more resistant crops. By themselves, these efforts to adapt cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread and permanent impacts. Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C" through mitigation efforts. However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C by the end of the century. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

  the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet. Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature. This is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation. The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean. The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents. The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole

   In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain. Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat. However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet. In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide. She concluded that "An atmosphere of that gas would

  temperature of the planet would drop below -40 C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 C. In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water – a so-called ocean planet – the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 C. In 2021, scientists reported that Earth dimmed by ~0.5% over two decades (1998-2017) as measured by earthshine using modern photometric techniques. This may have both been co-caused by climate change as well as a substantial increase in global warming. However, the link to climate change has not been explored to date and it is unclear whether or not this represents an ongoing trend.

  In April 2008 Stern said that the severity of his findings were vindicated by the 2007 IPCC report and admitted that in the Stern Review, "We underestimated the risks [...] we underestimated the damage associated with temperature increases [...] and we underestimated the probabilities of temperature increases". In June 2008, Stern said that because climate change is happening faster than predicted, the cost to reduce carbon would be even higher, of about 2% of GDP instead of the 1% in the original report. In an interview at the 2013 World Economic Forum, Stern said "Looking back, I underestimated the risks. The planet and the atmosphere seem to be absorbing less carbon than we expected, and emissions are rising pretty strongly. Some of the effects are coming through more quickly than we thought then" in the 2006 Review. He now believes we are "on track for something like four degrees".

  Attenborough starts the second programme by looking at potential future events, before warning that what happens over the next few years is crucial. A BBC weather forecast for the year 2050 shows that summer temperatures of 38 °C for the UK are "par for the course". The probable range by which the planet will warm over the next century is between 1.4 °C and 5.8 °C. Or, says Attenborough, "to put it another way, the impact of global warming will be somewhere between severe and catastrophic." The naturalist is invited to watch a film that illustrates regional change over the next 100 years. A 2 °C rise for the south of England, for example, may not seem to be much but that is not all there is to it. Rainfall is also predicted to be more intense and storms could be five times more frequent than they are

  maximum and minimum declination vary because the plane of the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined about 5.14° with respect to the ecliptic plane, and the spatial direction of the Moon's orbital inclination gradually changes over an 18.6-year cycle, alternately adding to or subtracting from the 23.5° tilt of Earth's axis. Therefore, the maximum declination of the Moon varies roughly from (23.5° − 5° =) 18.5° to (23.5° + 5° =) 28.5°.

  of natural gas from methane clathrate deposits in runaway climate change could be a cause of past, future, and present climate changes. The release of this trapped methane is a potential major outcome of a rise in temperature; some have suggested that this was a main factor in the planet warming 6 °C, which happened during the end-Permian extinction, as methane is much more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Despite its atmospheric lifetime of around 12 years, it has a global warming potential of 72 over 20 years, 25 over 100 years, and 33 when accounted for aerosol interactions. The theory also predicts this will greatly affect available oxygen and hydroxyl radical content of the atmosphere.

  A common type of short circuit occurs when the positive and negative terminals of a battery are connected with a low-resistance conductor, like a wire. With a low resistance in the connection, a high current will flow, causing the delivery of a large amount of energy in a short period of time. A high current flowing through a battery can cause a rapid increase of temperature, potentially resulting in an explosion with the release of hydrogen gas and electrolyte (an acid or a base), which can burn tissue and cause blindness or even death. Overloaded wires will also overheat causing damage to the wire's insulation, or starting a

  High current conditions may also occur with electric motor loads under stalled conditions, such as when the impeller of an electrically driven pump is jammed by debris; this is not a short, though it may have some similar effects. In electrical devices, unintentional short circuits are usually caused when a wire's insulation breaks down, or when another conducting material is introduced, allowing charge to flow along a different path than the one intended. In mains circuits, short circuits may occur between two phases, between a phase and neutral or between a phase and earth (ground). Such short circuits are likely to result in a very high current and

  The polarity of voltage on an anode with respect to an associated cathode varies depending on the device type and on its operating mode. In the following examples, the anode is negative in a device that provides power, and positive in a device that consumes power: In a discharging battery or galvanic cell (diagram on left), the anode is the negative terminal because it is where conventional current flows into the cell. This inward current is carried externally by electrons moving outwards, negative charge flowing in one direction being electrically equivalent to positive charge flowing in the opposite direction. In a recharging battery, or an electrolytic cell, the anode is the positive terminal, which receives

  injury to other organs. For a burn to be classified as electrical, electricity must be the direct cause. For example, burning a finger on a hot electric steam iron would be thermal, not electrical. According to Joule's first law: electricity passing through resistance creates heat, so there is no current entering the body in this type of burn. Likewise, a fire that is ruled to be "electrical" in origin, does not necessarily mean that any injuries or deaths are due to electrical burns. Unless someone was injured at the exact moment that the fire began, it is unlikely that any electrical burns would occur.

 To prevent electric shock or lightning injury in children, there are several precautions that should be taken:

1. Teach your child to avoid open water, tall trees, high ground, or metal objects (e.g., a shovel) during thunderstorms. This is important as being near these objects can increase the risk of being struck by lightning.

2. Ensure that your child does not touch electrical appliances, such as a hair dryer or radio, while in a bathtub. Water can conduct electricity, and contact with electricity in water can cause severe electric shock.

3. Cover all electrical outlets with plastic safety caps to prevent children from inserting objects into them. This helps to reduce the risk of electric shock.

4. Unplug appliances, such as hair dryers and curling irons, when they are not in use. This eliminates the risk of accidental contact with electrical currents.

5. Keep electrical cords away from toddlers who might chew on them. Children may not understand the dangers associated with chewing on electrical cords, which can lead to electric shock or burns.

6. Teach your child not to turn on lights or electrical appliances while standing on a wet floor or wet ground. Wet surfaces can conduct electricity and increase the risk of electric shock.

By following these precautions, you can significantly reduce the risk of electric shock or lightning injury in children.

  Shown at right is an example of a simple system that would exhibit the bulk photovoltaic effect. There are two electronic levels per unit cell, separated by a large energy gap, say 3 eV. The blue arrows indicate radiative transitions, i.e. an electron can absorb a UV photon to go from A to B, or it can emit a UV photon to go from B to A. The purple arrows indicate nonradiative transitions, i.e. an electron can go from B to C by emitting many phonons, or can go from C to B by absorbing many phonons. When light is shining, an electron will occasionally move right by absorbing a photon and going from A to B to C. However, it will almost never move in the reverse direction, C to B to A, because the transition from C to B cannot be excited by photons, but instead requires an improbably large thermal fluctuation. Therefore, there is a net rightward photocurrent. Because the electrons undergo a "shift" each time they absorb a photon (on average), this photocurrent is sometimes called a "shift current".

 Hydrocution refers to the term used to describe death or injury caused by electric shock in water. When a person comes into contact with an electric current while being submerged in water, it can lead to severe consequences. The term "hydrocution" combines the words "hydro" meaning water and "electrocution" meaning death or severe injury from electricity.

When an electric shock occurs in water, the water acts as a conductor, allowing the electric current to pass through the body more easily. This can increase the severity of the shock as the current travels through vital organs and muscles. The consequences of hydrocution can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on the severity and duration of the electric shock.

It is important to note that electric shock in water can occur in various situations, including faulty electrical equipment near water sources, swimming pool accidents, or mishandling of electrical appliances near water. Precautions should always be taken to prevent the risk of hydrocution, such as ensuring proper insulation of electrical equipment near water and using ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCIs) in areas where water and electricity may come into contact.

In summary, hydrocution refers to the electrocution that occurs when a person comes into contact with electric current while submerged in water. It is essential to be aware of the risks associated with hydrocution and take appropriate measures to prevent such accidents from happening.

  In general, photosynthesis in cyanobacteria uses water as an electron donor and produces oxygen as a byproduct, though some may also use hydrogen sulfide a process which occurs among other photosynthetic bacteria such as the purple sulfur bacteria. Carbon dioxide is reduced to form carbohydrates via the Calvin cycle. The large amounts of oxygen in the atmosphere are considered to have been first created by the activities of ancient cyanobacteria. They are often found as symbionts with a number of other groups of organisms such as fungi (lichens), corals, pteridophytes (Azolla), angiosperms (Gunnera), etc. There are some groups capable of heterotrophic growth, while others are parasitic, causing diseases in invertebrates or algae (e.g., the black band disease).

  Photosynthesis systems function by measuring gas exchange of leaves. Atmospheric carbon dioxide is taken up by leaves in the process of photosynthesis, where is used to generate sugars in a molecular pathway known as the Calvin cycle. This draw-down of induces more atmospheric  to diffuse through stomata into the air spaces of the leaf. While stoma are open, water vapor can easily diffuse out of plant tissues, a process known as transpiration. It is this exchange of and water vapor that is measured as a proxy of photosynthetic rate. The basic components of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, infrared gas analyzer (IRGA), batteries and

  Artificial photosynthesis is a chemical process that biomimics the natural process of photosynthesis to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. The term artificial photosynthesis is commonly used to refer to any scheme for capturing and storing the energy from sunlight in the chemical bonds of a fuel (a solar fuel). Photocatalytic water splitting converts water into hydrogen and oxygen and is a major research topic of artificial photosynthesis. Light-driven carbon dioxide reduction is another process studied that replicates natural carbon fixation. Research on this topic includes the design and assembly of devices for the direct production of solar fuels, photoelectrochemistry and its application in fuel cells, and the engineering of enzymes and photoautotrophic microorganisms for microbial biofuel and biohydrogen production from sunlight.

  Cyanobacteria use the energy of sunlight to drive photosynthesis, a process where the energy of light is used to synthesize organic compounds from carbon dioxide. Because they are aquatic organisms, they typically employ several strategies which are collectively known as a " concentrating mechanism" to aid in the acquisition of inorganic carbon ( or bicarbonate). Among the more specific strategies is the widespread prevalence of the bacterial microcompartments known as carboxysomes, which co-operate with active transporters of CO2 and bicarbonate, in order to accumulate bicarbonate into the cytoplasm of the cell. Carboxysomes are icosahedral structures composed of hexameric shell proteins that assemble into cage-like structures that can be several hundreds of nanometres in diameter. It is believed that these structures tether the -fixing enzyme, RuBisCO, to the interior of the shell, as well as the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, using metabolic channeling to enhance the local concentrations and thus increase the efficiency of the RuBisCO enzyme.

  The Calvin cycle, light-independent reactions, bio synthetic phase, dark reactions, or photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle of photosynthesis are the chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. The Calvin cycle is present in all photosynthetic eukaryotes and also many photosynthetic bacteria. In plants, these reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them. The Calvin cycle uses the reducing powers ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to produce sugars for the plant to use. These substrates are used in a series of reduction-oxidation reactions to produce sugars in a step-wise process. There is no direct reaction that converts to a sugar because all

  The evolution of photosynthesis refers to the origin and subsequent evolution of photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is used to assemble sugars from carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The process of photosynthesis was discovered by Jan Ingenhousz, a Dutch-born British physician and scientist, first publishing about it in 1779. The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life and most likely used reducing agents such as hydrogen or electrons, rather than water. There are three major metabolic pathways by which photosynthesis is carried out: C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis, and CAM photosynthesis. C3 photosynthesis is the oldest and most common form. C3 is a plant that uses the calvin cycle for the initial steps that incorporate into organic material. C4 is a plant that prefaces the calvin cycle with reactions that incorporate into four-carbon compounds. CAM is a plant that uses crassulacean acid metabolism, an adaptation for photosynthesis in arid conditions. C4 and CAM Plants have special adaptations that save water.

 Chloroplasts play a crucial role in the survival of eukaryotic cells. They are believed to have originated from symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria that were acquired by eukaryotic cells possessing mitochondria. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome and perform photosynthesis.

Photosynthesis is the process by which chloroplasts use the energy from sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water. This process converts light energy into chemical energy stored in the form of carbohydrates, such as glucose. The carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis serve as a source of energy and organic compounds for the host eukaryotic cell.

The products of photosynthesis, including glucose and oxygen, are delivered to the host cell as food. Glucose serves as a vital energy source for cellular processes, providing the necessary fuel for various metabolic reactions. Oxygen, on the other hand, is released into the surrounding environment, supporting aerobic respiration in other organisms.

The presence of chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells, particularly in plants and algae, enables these organisms to generate their own food through photosynthesis. This ability to produce energy-rich carbohydrates gives them a significant advantage in terms of survival and growth. Furthermore, the partnership between eukaryotic cells and chloroplasts is believed to have evolved around 1.5 billion years ago when the Earth's atmosphere became rich in oxygen.

In summary, chloroplasts contribute to the survival of eukaryotic cells by performing photosynthesis, synthesizing carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water using sunlight energy. The products of photosynthesis, such as glucose and oxygen, provide nourishment and energy for the host cell, enabling it to carry out essential cellular processes and ensuring the organism's survival.

These systems may calculate water use efficiency (A/E), stomatal conductance (gs), intrinsic water use efficiency (A/gs), and sub-stomatal concentration (Ci). Chamber and leaf temperatures are measured with a thermistor sensor. Some systems are also designed to control environmental conditions.

On a trip to France a few years ago, I was shocked to see pornography openly displayed on the streets in large advertisements. How odd that to unveil a woman for all to gape at is civilized, but for her to cover up to ward off gazes is a crime...While the French Prime Minister sees no problem with exposing in public places a woman’s glorious nakedness, he is oddly and quite rabidly disturbed by allowing others to cover it

The same thing happens when she is sent for water, except that she says her petticoat was too long; and then when she is sent for slippers, and says her hood blocked her sight. Finally, the Sun realized she is unhappy and decided to send her home. He summons animals to ask whether they would take her home, and then what they would eat on the way. In Megas's variant, both lions and foxes say they will eat Maroula; only foxes say the same in Lang's.

  A childless woman tells the Sun that if she could only have a child, the Sun could take the child when she was twelve. Then she has a daughter, Maroula or Letiko. When Maroula is twelve, a fine gentlemen meets her while she is gathering herbs and tells her to remind her mother of her promise. In Megas's variant, this happens twice; the first, the mother instructs Maroula to tell the Sun that she forgot; the second, the Sun has her put an apple in her headdress to remind her by falling out in the evening; the mother keeps her a long time, and finally sends her

In both variants, she is miserable in the Sun's house and makes up excuses. In Megas's, she scratches her own cheeks and blames, in turn, a cockeral, a cat, and a rose bush for scratching her.

 In February of 2008 we got some bad news. Our friend’s daughter had cancer. This was very devastating to us because we had two daughters so we knew how much our friends were hurting. She was only 19 years old and the threat of cancer hanging over her was certainly frightening. She was a heady smart intelligent young woman who loved to spend time reading and working on her computer. She did not spend a lot of time outside and she had the loveliest white complexion that a lot of people would say was most pleasing.
We told our friends about the vitamin d thing and how it could help prevent and maybe even help the healing process. Vitamin D3, it seems works, along several pathways to help heal disease. Number one it helps at a genetic level to tell immature tumor cells that they are just that and to stop growing or cellular apoptosis. The D3 also helps the blood supply network that is feeding the tumor to stop growing from a genetic level because this is not the normal design of the body or angiogenesis. Also it raises the level of innate immunity so the body develops appropriate defensins such as cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides, phagocytes, and neutrofil granulocites that help destroy and adsorb ‘bad cells’ and ‘foreign bodies’ in the blood system. There is also an aid to T-cell regulation in this complex system of immunity. And if you are taking chemo one of the problems is thrombosis and vitamin D3 helps to control this issue as well.
It would seem that if any of this were true that you would want to get your serum level of 25(OH)D up to that of a sunny country or about 54 ng/ml to 90 ng/ml to allow the body to heal itself. However our friends, one of them a medical professional, thought that if there was anything to this understanding of vitamin D that the cancer ‘experts’ or oncologist would have long ago begin this practice of maintaining a ‘sunny country’ level of vitamin D3 in cancer patients. This seemed like a reasonable decision at the time. I just can’t imagine the advice and what type that you would get if a family member had cancer.
The treatment protocols for our friend seemed to progress well through the year and they thought that with the combination of radiation and chemo that they had the cancer under control. On the Friday before thanksgiving they decided to take their daughter back to the hospital for evaluation because she was having a lot of problems with headaches. It turns out hat she had more tumors that had come back so they decided to begin treatment again on the following Monday. Their daughter died on Saturday before they had a chance to begin treatment. We are grieving.
In February of 2008 we got some more bad news. My brother called to say that he had a girl friend that was in a serious way with cancer. It turns out that she had ovarian cancer that was discovered two years prior. She had surgery and had the tumors removed as well as her uterus. She was told at the time that the cancer had metastasized to so many places in her body that she would have only two years to live. She had a great job in New York City but decided that life should be lived to its fullest and she would come back home and take a walk on the wild side. Who could blame her for this action?
My brother said that she had internal bleeding as she was passing blood and that all of her lymph nodes were swollen all over her body and that she had other lumps. It seems that her medical insurance had expired and that she ‘had enough’ of the medical system. With not any energy left she decided to just go to bed to die. My brother wanted to help but did not know what to do. He called to ask if there was anything to this vitamin D. I told him that I did not think that it would help anyone who was this far along with developed cancer and that the best thing he could do was to call the woman’s oncologist expert that we have in our family to see if he had any suggestions and to get this woman to a doctor.
My brother decided that he would just tell her about the vitamin D and see what she wanted to do. She agreed that if it could even give her any relief that she was willing to try it. She decided to take 50,000 IU of D3 per day or 1.25 milligrams for three months. She took other supplements as well like calcium, vitamin A from fish liver oil, chelated magnesium, zinc, vitamin C, and a vitamin B complex. I told my brother that it sounded like the alphabet of nutrition. She had also read that it would help balance the body’s system to drink bicarbonate of soda every day so she did that.
In late October I got a call from the woman. She wanted to call to say thank you for helping them find out about the information on vitamin D3. She said that all of her symptoms were gone and that she had the most energy that she had in twenty five years. She was out looking for work. I asked her about the vitamin D3 and how she had taken it and she said that she took a 50,000 IU per day until the bottle was gone or 100 days (at this level of use you could expect toxicity to begin at about six months or more) and then took a 50,000 IU once per week. After she realized that she was not going to die she went to a doctor that advised her to keep taking the vitamin D3 at one 50,000IU per week as it would certainly do no harm.
I just did not know what to think at this point. Had my brother exaggerated the symptoms of her cancer? Was there some kind of spontaneous remission of the cancer? She had reunited with her mother and they had the church praying for her so maybe it was a miracle of God and whatever the path it certainly is a miracle of God. Anyway I could not wrap my mind around this. Maybe the researchers are correct but just did not know how correct they are. I understand that there are ongoing trials for the prevention of cancer with vitamin D3 but has anyone thought about trials for the treatment of cancer. Are we so tied into a system that only responds to profit that we can not just help heal people and consider their health a profit?
I checked just a couple of weeks ago and my brother said, ‘yeah she is doing just fine’. I still do not know what to think!?
If you think you have any symptoms of cancer go to a doctor! You may also want to think about using D3 to get your serum level to that of sunny country as it will not do any harm and may help you significantly. Also, please consider you diet to determine if you are getting the correct foods for essential nutrition.

 yOU DON'T have to get burned to increase the risk of skin cancer. So if you store all your sunscreen in your beach bag, do yourself a favor and get an extra tube for when you drive to the mall or walk the dog.
"The damage caused by the sun is incremental," says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., and author of Total Skin. "It accumulates over your lifetime." In other words, your risk increases one sunny (or cloudy) day at a time.
With more than a million cases each year, skin cancer accounts for a majority of all cancers in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society. Most cases can be cured if detected and treated early. However, skin cancer does kill: About 10,000 people are expected to die from it in 2006.
Sunlight induces skin cancer in several ways, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. First, ultraviolet light damages DNA, leading to mutations that can contribute to cancer; second, it produces activated oxygen molecules that harm DNA and other structures in the cells; and third, it suppresses immune function around the area of the sun damage, which impedes the body's own natural defenses against cancer.
Actinic keratosis is considered the first step in the development of some skin cancers. It refers to small, scaly spots — commonly found on the face, ears, neck, lower arms, and back of the hands in fair-skinned people who have had significant sun exposure — which may become cancerous if not treated or removed. To prevent an actinic keratosis from turning into cancer, some doctors prescribe topical treatments like diclofenac (Solaraze), imiquimod (Aldara), and tretinoin (Retin-A).
Basal cell carcinoma (75 percent of cases) generally appears as raised, translucent lumps. While it usually doesn't spread to other body parts, it can be disfiguring.
Squamous cell carcinoma (20 percent) develops in the upper layer of the skin, most often in places that have been exposed to sun. It tends to manifest as raised reddish bumps or growths. Squamous cell can spread to other parts of the body; once this happens, it is more difficult to treat.
Melanoma (4 percent) is the most dangerous kind of skin cancer; it can spread throughout the body via the bloodstream and the lymph system. It also shows up in younger patients — half of all cases occur under age 57. Symptoms include irregularly shaped brown or black blemishes.
Asymmetry Skin cancers often have irregular shapes.
Border Trouble spots can be indicated by ragged and poorly defined edges or rolled borders.
Color Lesions can be very dark, multicolored, or mottled with shades of black, brown, or tan, or even white, gray, red, or blue. Basal cell may be indicated by pink growths or pale yellow or waxy scarlike areas.
Diameter Watch for spots greater than ¼ inch, about the size of a pencil eraser tip. Basal cell can show up as larger reddish patches, which may or may not crust, itch, or hurt.
Et cetera Other warning signs of skin cancer include a sore that doesn't heal or a change in how a mole feels (it begins to hurt, show tenderness, or itch) or behaves (it starts to bleed or ooze).
Staying out of the sun is by far the most effective way to prevent skin cancer. Using sunscreen is the next-best strategy, and you should never wander far from your trusty bottle of SPF 30. (The number refers to the level of sun protection factor against UVB radiation.) "Just like you brush your teeth every day, you should use sunscreen every day," advises dermatologist Joshua Fox, M.D., director of Advanced Dermatology P.C. in New York and a spokesman for the American Academy of Dermatology "Even on a cloudy day, up to 80 percent of the sun's rays get through."
It's worse at the beach or on the slopes. Water reflects 20 percent of the sun's rays, while sand and snow boost them by 80 percent. "It's like being hit from both sides," Fox says.
Sunscreen and sunblock are not the same. In sunscreens, chemicals like benzophenones, cinnamates, salicylates, and para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA, a compound linked to allergic reactions in some people) prevent sun damage by chemically absorbing radiation before it reaches the skin. Pick a product that works on both UVA and UVB radiation; Leffell likes the brands Ombrelle, Sundown, Water Babies, BullFrog, and PreSun.
Sunblocks contain ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide that lie on top of the skin and physically obstruct UVA and UVB radiation. "Blocks are less likely to cause allergic reactions and are sometimes called 'chemical-free,'" says Leffell. "You can't get more natural than zinc oxide." Sunblocks with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are also "photo-stable," which means they do not change in the presence of light; many products combine the two agents, such as Jason Family Block, SkinCeuticals Physical UV Defense, and Aveeno Continuous Protection Sunblock Lotion.
Don't spend a fortune for sun protection, but choose something with an appealing texture; otherwise you'll never use it. It takes about 1 teaspoon to cover the face and neck and 1 to 3 tablespoons for the body. Apply 30 minutes before sun exposure; it's best to reapply frequently, though no SPF allows you to stay out in the sun all day.
If you run out of sunscreen, don't presume that throwing on a shirt will defend you from the sun. "The average white T-shirt has an SPF of four to six," notes Leffell.
Loosely woven garments that are light in color, thin, or stretchy (which describes most warm-weather fabrics) offer little safety. "Very fair people and those who have had skin cancer should wear broad-brimmed hats and use sun-protective clothing," Leffell advises.
Green tea has previously shown anti-carcinogenic potential. Various animal studies have found that the polyphenols in green tea (and, to a lesser extent, black tea) consumed as a beverage or applied to the skin appear to prevent skin cancer induced by ultraviolet radiation.
Apigenin A flavonoid found in herbs (endives, cloves), vegetables (beans, broccoli, celery, leeks, onions, barley, parsley, tomatoes), fruits (apples, cherries, grapes), and beverages (tea, wine).
Curcumin A yellow pigment that's obtained from the turmeric rhizome.
Proanthocyanidins Antioxidants found in grape seeds.
Resveratrol A compound found in grape skins, peanuts, red wine, and mulberries.
Silymarin A flavonoid extracted from the seeds of milk thistle.
"Consumption of these dietary botanicals may provide efficient protection against the effects of solar ultraviolet radiation," says Katiyar, who due to quality concerns recommends whole foods over supplements when possible. It's easy to pair green tea with meals; look to Indian cookbooks for ways to use turmeric. The suggested dose for standardized milk thistle supplements is 200 to 400 milligrams per day.
Is sun all bad? Well, it's important for the body's production of vitamin D, which maintains bone density. It might even offer protection against diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, says Boston University School of Medicine professor Michael Holick, M.D., Ph.D., author of The UV Advantage.
Holick advises people to expose their arms and legs to five to 10 minutes of sunshine between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. (depending on season, skin type, and latitude) two or three days a week. This allows the body to manufacture the vitamin D it needs without increasing skin-cancer risk, he claims.
But other dermatologists disagree, especially since you can get vitamin D through supplements. Responding to Holick's suggestion, the Skin Cancer Foundation notes that unprotected sun exposures of just two or three minutes can begin breaking down skin tissues. James M. Spencer, M.D., a clinical professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a member of the foundation's medical council, suggests protecting bone health by drinking vitamin-D-fortified juice or milk, eating fatty fish, or taking a daily multivitamin containing 600 units of vitamin D. "It's a lot safer," he says.
Fox concurs: "I think it's better to wear sunscreen every day."
The upper and lower eyelids are two of the most common places on the face that skin cancer can occur, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation; these cases can be hard to treat and account for about to percent of all skin-cancer deaths. Other than staying out of the sun, the best way to prevent skin cancer on the eyelids is to wear UV-blocking sunglasses, which can stop more than 99 percent of UVA and UVB rays from reaching the area. Wraparound sunglasses protect a wider section of skin than ordinary styles.
Other ways to guard your delicate lids include carefully applying sunscreen around the area — a sunblock stick makes this easier to do safely — and wearing a hat with a brim that is at feast 3 to 4 inches wide.
Another prime site for skin cancer is the lips (particularly the lower lip, which gets more sunlight). Protect your kisser with sun-blocking lip balms like Almay Pure Tints Protective Lip Care or C.O. Bigelow Lip Formula.
Chemotherapy Cancer-fighting drugs are applied to the skin. If the cancer hat spread, the drugs may be administered Into the bloodstream.
cells are vaporized with Intense waves of light.
Surgery Cancerous tissue is cut away; the excision is then stitched closed. Large wounds may require skin grafts from other parts of the body.
Cancer cells are scraped away with an Instrument that resembles a vegetable peeler. It may be followed by treatment with an electric needle to destroy remaining cancer cells. Both of these procedures are typically repeated a few times.
Cryosurgery Cancer cells are frozen and destroyed with liquid nitrogen.
Mohs micrographic surgery Cancerous tissue is cut or scraped away. During the procedure, the tissue is microscopically examined to determine whether more skin must be excised in order to remove the entire tumor.
Radiation High-energy rays or particles are beamed at the skin to destroy cancer cells. Up to 30 treatments may be required.
Nearly 30 million Americans visit indoor tanning salons each year, and many of them believe what they're doing carries no danger. Not true. "Indoor tanning is simply not safe," says James M. Spencer, M.D., a board member of the Skin Cancer Foundation.
In a large-scale Scandinavian study, tanning-bed use was associated with a 55 percent increase in melanoma risk, especially in participants between the ages of 20 and 29.
"We know that tanning-parlor radiation definitely causes skin cancer," says David J. Leffell, M.D., professor of dermatology and surgery at Yale University School of Medicine. "Those are the same lightbulbs we use in the lab to cause skin cancer."
Since the damaging effects accumulate over time, indoor tanning is particularly dangerous during the teenage years. "In my experience, any woman in her 20s who has a skin cancer most likely says she used tanning parlors," Leffell reports.
PHOTO (COLOR): SUN DAMAGE is quick and cumulative. But protective strategies can keep those cancerous rays at bay.

 She was told she had seasonal affective disorder—which just meant she was getting depressed in the winter!_

_We found she had extremely low vitamin D levels.Newer research by Dr. Michael Holick, a vitamin D pioneer and professor of medicine, physiology, and dermatology at Boston University School of Medicine, recommends intakes of up to 2,000 IU a day, or enough to keep blood levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D at between 40 to 60 ng/ml. Lifeguards have levels of over 100 ng/ml without toxicity. So supplementation is essential unless we are spending all our time at the beach, eating thirty ounces of wild salmon a day, or downing ten tablespoons of cod liver oil a day! The exact amount needed to get your blood levels to the optimal range (50 to 80 ng/ml) will vary depending on your age, genetics, how far north you live, how much time you spend in the sun, and even the time of the year. We are scared into thinking that high doses are toxic, but one study of healthy young men receiving 10,000 IU of vitamin D for twenty weeks showed no toxicity (I wouldn't try that, though, without a doctor's supervision). Here is a story of one of my patients to show just how powerful supplementing with vitamin D can be. _N orah, a fifty-two-year-old woman, worked and lived in Boston. She spent her time as a software programmer in the basement of an old building. Every winter she would sink into a deep, dark slump. She dreaded the shortening of the days._

_Like most women, she kept out of the sun to prevent skin cancer and wrinkles and always wore sunblock and a hat when out in the sun._

_She also found her muscles ached worse in the winter, and her doctor told her that she had osteoporosis. She was told she had seasonal affective disorder—which just meant she was getting depressed in the winter!_

_We found she had extremely low vitamin D levels.They work in similar ways to vitamins, as helpers for the body's enzymes.They are needed to make our bones (calcium) and our blood cells (iron) and for our nervous system.While all are important, there are a few that are key players in optimal brain function: magnesium, zinc, and selenium.#### Magnesium: The Relaxation Mineral

  changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the microbiota mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil. ; 3) Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen. They also create room for beneficial insects and annelids (the phylum of worms). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a mutualistic relationship with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the rhizobium) that can fix nitrogen.

 This is called ploughing.During the hysteroscopy, Dr. Cohen removed the white patches of tissue with a tiny instrument that scraped the inside of my uterus.After knocking me out with general anesthesia, he dilated my cervix and inserted a thin fiber-optic "flashlight" called a hysteroscope, which let him view my womb (womb with a view?).Dr. Cohen suggested a hysteroscopy.If your uterus is too small, tipped the wrong way, divided by a thin layer of tissue into two chambers (called a bicornuate uterus), partially divided (called septate uterus), inhabited by fibroid tumors, or overgrown with polyps, you will have fertility issues that need to be solved. This Is Your Cervix

The cervix is the bottom opening of your uterus; the front door to the vagina. If you use tampons and push one in as far as it can go, you may bump into your cervix. This is also what your doctor is looking at during your annual exam, when your feet are in the stirrups, the sheet is over your knees, and the speculum is in place. Besides standing sentry to the womb, the cervix also produces cervical mucus—that slippery clear fluid sperm love. The cervix also dilates, or opens, when your baby is ready to be born. * * *

JULIE

I guess I really took my uterus for granted, never realizing all the things that could go wrong with it. Actually, until I wanted to get pregnant and couldn't, I never bothered to think about it at all. Here's this organ, tucked inside your pelvis, about the size of your fist, that only bothers you once a month when it discharges its contents. What could go wrong with a uterus? Apparently, a lot. In my case, uterine sonograms showed a skimpy endometrial lining that was too thin to support life. Additionally, white patches of scar tissue (?!) showed up on parts of my uterus as well. Scar tissue is also not conducive to an egg attaching or a placenta forming. To find out what was going on, my doctor had to go in. Dr. Cohen suggested a hysteroscopy. After knocking me out with general anesthesia, he dilated my cervix and inserted a thin fiber-optic "flashlight" called a hysteroscope, which let him view my womb (womb with a view?). During the hysteroscopy, Dr. Cohen removed the white patches of tissue with a tiny instrument that scraped the inside of my uterus. This is called ploughing.If you try to plant a seed on hard, compacted soil, it can't lay down its roots and grow—same with patchy white scar tissue on a uterus.It's not good for a fertilized egg to attach roots and grow, either.So Dr. Cohen literally scraped up those patchy areas of my uterus.

  crisis. This is measured through a base line in the form of pre-existing risk of crisis or destruction. There are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it:  A problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting crops at a location with heavy rainfall and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of soil erosion by water, yet farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high crop yields.

 With the development of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, we could see even more detailed brain images—enabling us to diagnose strokes, tumors, and hemorrhages.We finally had a way to look at brain tissue beyond what conventional X-ray machines could provide.During medical school in the mid-1970s, I remember our excitement the first time we viewed computed tomography, or CT, scans of the brain.Memory training is actually a focused form of mental stimulation that allows you to efficiently pack a big memory punch in a short amount of time. Even if memory training doesn't ultimately prevent Alzheimer's disease, it will improve current memory ability. It is eminently achievable. One of the greatest benefits of memory training is that it gives us tools to use throughout our lives. If we master the techniques early on, we have a better chance of heading off memory loss that might emerge in the future. ## Windows to Your Brain: New Technologies to Detect Brain Aging

Despite our best efforts at gyms and beauty salons, the physical results of aging are fairly obvious: wrinkling skin, graying hair, even disappearing hair for many of us. In contrast, brain aging is a much greater challenge to detect. Scientists have searched for decades to find a way to view brain structure and function, so as to pinpoint a problem that might improve with treatment and determine the specific treatment, when to intervene, and whether the patient was benefiting from it. Recently there have been research breakthroughs from diverse scientific disciplines—genetics, chemistry, physics, biomathematics, as well as others—that are finally opening windows into the brain, using new technologies like positron emission tomography, or PET, scanning. We can now view brain aging directly and thereby specifically guide our treatments to prevent future memory loss. During medical school in the mid-1970s, I remember our excitement the first time we viewed computed tomography, or CT, scans of the brain. We finally had a way to look at brain tissue beyond what conventional X-ray machines could provide. With the development of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, we could see even more detailed brain images—enabling us to diagnose strokes, tumors, and hemorrhages.If only we could actually see how effectively the neurons were or were not communicating with each other, then we might be able to pick up, and treat, more subtle brain deficiencies before the cells died.

  Thin-film layers are common in the natural world. Their effects produce colors seen in soap bubbles and oil slicks, as well as the structural coloration of some animals. The wings of many insects act as thin-films, because of their minimal thickness. This is clearly visible in the wings of many flies and wasps. In butterflies, the thin-film optics is visible when wing itself is not covered by wing scales, which is the case in the blue wing spots of the Aglais io and the blue-green patches of the Graphium sarpedon. In buttercups, the flower's gloss is due to a thin-film, which enhances the flower's visibility to pollinating insects and aids in temperature regulation of the plant's reproductive organs.

 Presenting today chest radiographs of a 9-year-old girl with a persistent cough for the last two weeks, vomiting and fever. What do you see?
Dear friends, showing a chest radiograph taken seven days later. What do you see?
Findings: PA radiograph shows a rounded right mediastinal prominence at the level of the tracheal bifurcation (A, arrow). It could be either a lymph node or an enlarged azygos vein. The retrotracheal location in the lateral view (B, arrow) points to an azygos vein.
The aortic arch is located in the left side, as evidenced by the discrete imprint in the left tracheal wall (A, red arrow).
PA radiograph taken one week later demonstrates air in the gastric fornix, which is located under the right hemidiaphragm (C, arrow). It is confirmed by a supine film of the abdomen (D, arrow), which also shows the liver in the left upper quadrant (D, asterisk).
Barium study confirms the right-sided stomach (E, arrow) and malrotation of the bowel, mostly located in the right side of the abdomen (F).
Congratulations to MK and S who were the first to make the definitive diagnosis.
Teaching point: Sometimes, the unusual is more usual than expected. This is our third patient with levocardia and abdominal heterotaxia seen in the last four years (see Caceres´ Corner Case 194 and Dr. Pepe´s Summer Case 1). It may not be as rare as the textbooks state!
There appears to be a cut off sign of the right main bronchus with hyper expansion of the right lung. Possible that there is a foreign body in the right main bronchus.
To be honest with you, I don’t see hyperlucency of the right lung (look at the vessels).
Right paratracheal lymphadenomegaly and blunting of the right costodiaphragmatic recess (suggesting small amount of pleural fluid).
Tuberculosis is my best guess in this clinical scenario with that radiographic appearance. It could also be sarcoidosis but less likely.
wedge-shaped opacity seen on the lateral view over the anterior costophrenic recess, could not find a corresponding findings on the AP view.
I would say there are thickening of the posterior junction line and a small left pleural effusion.
What you call the posterior junction line is probably the esophagus. No clear signs of pleural effusion.
Small hyperlucent finding on the left , probably lower bronchus ( retroscardial).tiny foreign body.
I’m not sure I can clearly see the aortic knuckle on the PA, even though the mediastinum on the left seems prominent – could be due to rotation to the left.
On the right there seems to be a round opacity just caudal to the right paratracheal stripe – it might be a slightly enlarged azygos vein, but it might be that the vein is denser and either behind or in front of this slightly more lucent round structure.
On the lateral I cannot clearly visualize the IVC shadow near the posterior-inferior heart border.
Could there be some problem with the IVC and subsequent azygos enlargement?
Occupation of retrotachel space by nodular opacities. Adenopathy? mediastinitis? oesophageal disease? a vascular malformation is less likely, as the patient has acute symtoms.
On the PA chest film there is a well shaped right paratracheal mass.
The differential diagnosis can be aortic arch anomaly (right arch, aberrant right subclavian artery), adenopathy or tumor.
Where is the aortic knob?on the right side?
A right aortic knob is visible on the PA view. Left aortic knob is not seen. Do CT to look for aberrant left subclavian artery with possible compression of esophagus.
There’s a enlarged azygos vein in the PA view, and i can’t see a triangular density behind heart in the lateral view, representing vena cava. I think that azygos continuation of inferior vena cava is a possibility.
1) there is a tubular foreign body with central lumen-? toy in line with tracheal bifurcation and into rt main bronchus producing partial obstruction with obstructive emphysematous changes in rt lower zone, with mild widenind of lower intercostal spaces.
Rt hilum uplifted. Follow the old man’s advice!
is there a small air-fluid level on the pa film just above the carina? I do not see it on the lateral view, though.
Gastric bubble on the right side!!
Abdominal situs inversus with an enlarged azygos vein secondary to interruption of the IVC?
Azygos continuation of the IVC and abdominal situs ambiguus (right sided gastric bubble and possibly midline position of the liver) would suggest polysplenia syndrome due to partial absence of right-sided structures (such as the IVC) and predominance of left-sided structures.
In that case the right lung might have only two lobes, and both sides of the bronchial tree might have left-sided morphology.
I’m not sure if this is present in this case – the right bronchus seems normal to me.

There are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it:  A problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation, others might view as a benefit or opportunity. For example, planting crops at a location with heavy rainfall and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of soil erosion by water, yet farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high crop yields.
