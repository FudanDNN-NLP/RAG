You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.t5.tokenization_t5.T5Tokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565
Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at google-bert/bert-base-multilingual-cased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

  Janet Leigh was an American actress of film, television, stage, and radio, whose career spanned over five decades. Discovered by actress Norma Shearer, Leigh began her career appearing in several popular films for MGM which spanned a wide variety of genres, including Act of Violence (1948), Little Women (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Scaramouche (1952), The Naked Spur (1953), and Living It Up (1954). In the latter part of the 1950s, Leigh had supporting roles in Safari (1956), and Orson Welles's film noir Touch of Evil (1958). She went on to gain lasting recognition for her portrayal of the doomed Marion Crane in Alfred Hitchcock's horror film Psycho (1960), which earned her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress and an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting

  According to Vivien Leigh's biographer Alexander Walker, Laughton and Vivien Leigh didn't get along while working together. Walker wrote that when an attempt was made to obtain Leigh's services for a film version of Cyrano de Bergerac, Laughton stated that she would have to dye her hair blonde. Leigh asked for a blonde wig, but Laughton insisted she dye her hair. The discussions fell through and Leigh felt slighted. When Leigh was approached to make Sidewalks of London, she did not want to work with Laughton and she felt no attachment to the role. Nevertheless, she was persuaded otherwise.

In her biography My Mother Was Nuts, Penny Marshall states she was slated to direct (this would have been her first feature film) from a script by John Hughes (which would have been his first script to be adapted for film). This version of the screenplay consisted of several unrelated vignettes. The producers wanted to have Belushi wearing diapers on the poster, even though no such scene appeared in Hughes' screenplay. Martha Coolidge was fired from the movie, for cutting many scenes of gratuitous nudity, but declined an opportunity to have her directing credit appear as Alan Smithee.

  In 1962, she starred in the thriller The Manchurian Candidate, before deciding to scale back her career. Leigh continued to appear in films intermittently throughout the 1960s, with roles in Bye Bye Birdie (1963) and Harper (1966). She began to appear in television frequently in the 1970s, and had roles in such films as Night of the Lepus (1972) and Boardwalk (1979). In 1975, she made her Broadway debut in a production of Murder Among Friends. Leigh subsequently starred in two horror films with her daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis: John Carpenter's The Fog (1980) and Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998). Her last film role was in the comedy Bad Girls from Valley High, filmed in 2000 and released posthumously. Leigh died in 2004 of vasculitis, aged 77.

  Touch of Evil is a 1958 American film noir written and directed by Orson Welles, who also stars in the film. The screenplay was loosely based on the contemporary Whit Masterson novel Badge of Evil (1956). The cast included Charlton Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph Calleia, Akim Tamiroff, and Marlene Dietrich. In 1956, Universal-International commissioned a film adaptation of the mystery novel Badge of Evil. Albert Zugsmith was selected as producer, who then hired television writer Paul Monash to write the script. Months later, Charlton Heston was brought onboard to star, and requested that Orson Welles direct the project. In January 1957, Welles was hired to direct and star in the project, as well as re-write the script. Filming started in February 1957 and wrapped in April. During the film's post-production, creative differences between Welles and Universal executives arose, in which Welles was

  Walking My Baby Back Home is a 1953 American musical comedy film directed by Lloyd Bacon and starring Donald O'Connor, Janet Leigh, and Buddy Hackett. It was Hackett's film debut. Excerpts of the film are used in the Columbo episode "Forgotten Lady", in which Leigh plays a middle aged former film star Grace Wheeler who nostalgically watches the film. Donald O'Connor enjoyed working with Janet Leigh. "She hadn't danced in years but was a real trouper. Nine times out of 10 we'd do all those beautiful dance routines on cement, and she got very tired, started falling a lot on her knees. And her knees started to swell three times their normal size. It was very painful. On the screen you can't tell how she was suffering in that darn thing."

  Following is a 1998 independent neo-noir crime thriller film written, produced, edited and directed by Christopher Nolan. It tells the story of a young man who follows strangers around the streets of London and is drawn into a criminal underworld when he fails to keep his distance. As Nolan's debut feature, it was designed to be as inexpensive as possible to make. Scenes were heavily rehearsed so that just one or two takes were needed to economise on 16mm film stock, the production's greatest expense, and for which Nolan was paying from his salary. Unable to afford expensive professional lighting equipment, Nolan mostly used available light. Along with writing, directing, and photographing the film, Nolan also helped in editing and production. Following was released by The Criterion Collection on both Blu-ray and DVD in North America on 11 December 2012.

This type of storytelling, he says, reflected the audience's inherent uncertainty about characters in film noir: In a compelling story of this genre we are continually being asked to rethink our assessment of the relationship between the various characters, and I decided to structure my story in such a way as to emphasize the audience's incomplete understanding of each new scene as it is first presented.

Through an intercom on the wall, the headmaster announces that there will be ongoing changes in the school and that the students are to listen to all instructions from their teacher. The teacher then begins the lesson by writing "2 + 2 = 5" on the chalkboard. When the children protest, he immediately silences them, calling for order in the classroom. He then continuously commands the students to repeat the equation after him. One timid student raises his hand and carefully suggests that two plus two is four, not five. The teacher

  Following college, Cunningham worked for nearly three years in the circulation department of the Knox County Library in Knoxville, Tennessee. After his 1990 comic-book series The Men in Black from Aircel Comics finished its run, Cunningham worked as a factory security guard. When his comic became the basis for the 1997 film Men in Black, Cunningham earned what he said in an interview that year was an initial "six-figure sum. In the low six figures. I've been living off it for five years." This launched a media franchise that has included the sequels Men in Black II (2002) and Men in Black 3 (2012), a 2019 spin-off Men in Black: International, and an animated television program, Men in Black: The Series, which ran from October 1997 to June 2001. Cunningham went on to co-write four Star Wars parody short films with director John E. Hudgens, released from 2000 to 2005, and in 2012 returned to comics with About Comics' Jack Ooze, starring a district attorney turned semi-liquid superhero.

When his comic became the basis for the 1997 film Men in Black, Cunningham earned what he said in an interview that year was an initial "six-figure sum. In the low six figures.

 I made a movie once, Oscar with Sylvester Stallone, and everybody who saw the movie and liked it, would never go out and see Stallone. We did a preview of the movie and someone wrote on the card, 'Why didn't he take his shirt off and kill anybody?' [Laughs.] But we had an extraordinary cast, we had Kirk Douglas, Don Ameche, and a girl who had never been in a movie before: Marisa Tomei. She was so extremely great from the first day! And what had she done before? Practically nothing! Now, that's talent. She was so unbelievably good. In 2017, director John Landis said:  In 2020, Lee Pfeiffer of Cinema Retro wrote that "Oscar was a box office flop and critics attacked it across the board. However, it has aged very well and I found it to be a delight throughout. Give it chance, will ya?"

  The Academy Awards, popularly known as the Oscars, are awards for artistic and technical merit in the film industry. They are regarded by many as the most prestigious and significant awards in the entertainment industry worldwide. Given annually by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), the awards are an international recognition of excellence in cinematic achievements, as assessed by the Academy's voting membership. The various category winners are awarded a copy of a golden statuette as a trophy, officially called the "Academy Award of Merit", although more commonly referred to by its nickname, the "Oscar".

  Bunsen Is a Beast is an American animated television series created by Butch Hartman for Nickelodeon. It revolves around a small eccentric monster named Bunsen who begins attending a middle school that previously only admitted humans. In spite of prejudice against beasts, Bunsen befriends a human boy named Mikey Munroe and his homeschooled companion, Darcy. Together, Bunsen and his friends attempt to navigate through school life while outsmarting a student named Amanda who wants to rid society of Bunsen's kind. The show is based on a drawing of a monster and a boy that Hartman created in 2009. He originally considered writing a picture book featuring the characters, but decided against going forward

   Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures. An animated cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film aimed at children and featuring an exaggerated

  Shrek was originally set up to be a live-action/CG animation hybrid with background plate miniature sets and the main characters composited into the scene as motion-captured computer graphics, using an ExpertVision Hires Falcon 10 camera system to capture and apply realistic human movement to the characters. A sizable crew was hired to run a test, and after a year and a half of R & D, the test was finally screened in May 1997. The results were not satisfactory, with Katzenberg stating "It looked terrible, it didn't work, it wasn't funny, and we didn't like it." The studio then turned to its

  Members of the production team, including art director Maurice Hunt and six of his animators, spent several days in Australia to study settings and animals found in the Australian Outback to observe, take photographs, and draw sketches to properly illustrate the Outback on film.

 "I leave to the beneficence of my country my adopted (sic) daughter Horatia Nelson Thompson, and I desire she will use in future the name of Nelson only." Born in a house rented by Sir William Hamilton (Emma's husband) at 23 Piccadilly, London, as Nelson was at anchor in Torbay preparing to sail to the Battle of Copenhagen (news reached him before he set sail), she was given to a wet nurse called Mrs. Gibson, who was informed that the child, about a week old, was born six weeks earlier, at a time when Emma was in Vienna. Once Emma's husband

  McGrath decided to bring in American actress Gwyneth Paltrow to audition for Emma Woodhouse, after a suggestion from his agent and after seeing her performance in Flesh and Bone. Of his decision to bring Paltrow in for the part, McGrath revealed "The thing that actually sold me on her playing a young English girl was that she did a perfect Texas accent. I know that wouldn't recommend her to most people. I grew up in Texas, and I have never heard an actor or actress not from Texas sound remotely like a real Texan. I knew she had theater training, so she could carry herself. We had many actresses, big and small, who wanted to

  this part. The minute she started the read-through, the very first line, I thought, 'Everything is going to be fine; she's going to be brilliant.'" Following the read-through, the co-chairman of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein, decided to give Emma the green-light. However, he wanted Paltrow to appear in The Pallbearer first, before going ahead and allowing the film to be made. While she recovered from wisdom-tooth surgery, Paltrow had a month to herself to do her own research for the part. She also studied horsemanship, dancing, singing, archery and the "highly stylized" manners and dialect during a three-week rehearsal period. Jeremy Northam revealed that when he first tried to read Emma, he did not get very

  know. So I'm glad of that – because it was early on and I learnt my lesson. It's a good film, Emma, but I'm just... not very good in it. I'm not helped because I'm also wearing the world's worst wig. It's quite a laugh, checking that wig out." Real-life mother and daughter, Phyllida Law and Sophie Thompson, portrayed Mrs and Miss Bates. Thompson revealed that it was a coincidence that she and her mother were cast alongside each other, as the casting director had their names on separate lists. McGrath initially believed Thompson to be too young to play Miss Bates, but he changed his mind after seeing her wearing glasses with her hair

  Neal Smith (born September 23, 1947) is an American musician, best known as the drummer for the rock group Alice Cooper from 1967 to 1974. He performed on the group's early albums Pretties for You and Easy Action, their breakout album Love It to Death and the subsequent successful albums Killer, School's Out, and Billion Dollar Babies. The last new studio album with the five original Alice Cooper group members participating in new music was Muscle of Love in 1973.

  players along with great bassist Jack Bruce, and two of the five founding members of Alice Cooper including the songwriter of most of Alice Cooper's biggest hits Michael Bruce, among others. The record itself was a "buffet" of styles that mirrored the past releases of the guest talents involved. For example, the title track, "Midnight Daydream," which featured Band of Gypsys singer/drummer Buddy Miles, sounds like a Hendrix guitar-driven song. He has a son, Riley Cameron, who is determined to become the guitarist his dad wanted to become. Riley is the guitarist of a band that is currently recording their first album. He lives in Rocky Point, North Carolina.

  The Eyes of Alice Cooper, released in 2003, is the sixteenth solo album by Alice Cooper. With this album, Cooper returned to his earlier hard rock sound, in the vein of The Last Temptation, and left the heavy industrial metal sound found in his last two studio albums. Of note is the album cover, which was released in four different versions, featuring alternate colours in Cooper's eyes and the crescent around the 'A' in the title. It was available in blue, green, purple and red. In the 2010 Behind the Music Remastered on Alice Cooper, "Between High School & Old School" was described as "a modern Alice Cooper classic" for its return to the topic of school (a reference to "School's Out").

  Dick Wagner and fellow Cortez High School alum Mick Mashbir. In an interview with Marc Maron, according to Alice Cooper, "Glen ended up being one of the great rock guitar players of all time. He created 'School's Out'. He created all that stuff." In a separate interview, Cooper stated, "Glen was not a songwriter. He would write riffs, though. They would show up on the album, and even great guitar players would say, 'What is that line? It's so weird, but it's catchy.' Mike (Bruce) was much more into chord structure. So, Glen was always sort of our icing on the cake."

He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock audiences.

  a "Punch humorist" was a humorous story; when two years later he said he was writing nursery rhymes, his agent and publisher were convinced he should write another detective story; and after another two years, he was being told that writing a detective story would be in the worst of taste given the demand for children's books. He concluded that "the only excuse which I have yet discovered for writing anything is that I want to write it; and I should be as proud to be delivered of a Telephone Directory con amore as I should be ashamed to create a Blank Verse Tragedy at the bidding of others."

 It was my tenth wedding anniversary, and the next day would be my first full day off in almost three weeks.I headed home.But now with the CT scanner, the radiologist could drain the pus and bacteria using a little plastic tube.And in the old days anyone with a liver abscess had to go under the knife in the operating room.The surgeons have a saying, "Where there's pus, let there be steel."The technician was seated at the computer console scrolling through Doris's computer-generated x-rays. The round white spot on her liver images was obvious, even to me. I walked past him into the shielded room containing the white ring of the CT scanner. Doris was lying on her left side on a narrow, wheeled table. The radiologist was putting a Band-Aid over the puncture he'd just made in her liver. He turned to the Mayo stand and handed me a syringe filled with thick beige pus. Pay dirt for an ID specialist. As I walked down to the lab to make a Gram's stain of the specimen, I knew I had the key to Doris's illness in my hand. There under the microscope were a myriad of pink rods. So this was where the Klebsiella in her blood stream had come from. I guessed the germs had gone from her inflamed colon into the veins between the intestine and the liver. The liver normally filters out and destroys the few bacteria that find their way into the circulation. But, in Doris's case, either there were too many bacteria coming through at once, or her immune system was too weakened to filter the bacteria. The Klebsiella bacteria multiplied in the liver tissue and formed an abscess. When the abscess got large and the pressure inside it built up, bacteria were forced into the blood vessels draining the liver and got into the general circulation, producing septic shock. Now I knew why Doris remained so ill despite all the antibiotics I'd been pouring into her. Antibiotics can only kill the bacteria in the blood stream. They can't cure an abscess, which has to be drained. The surgeons have a saying, "Where there's pus, let there be steel." And in the old days anyone with a liver abscess had to go under the knife in the operating room. But now with the CT scanner, the radiologist could drain the pus and bacteria using a little plastic tube. I headed home. It was my tenth wedding anniversary, and the next day would be my first full day off in almost three weeks.On Saturday, the radiologist inserted a drainage tube into Doris's abscess.She spent three more weeks in the hospital, but she eventually made a complete recovery.Her colon cancer never returned.Now I see her once or twice a year in my clinic for routine physical examinations and minor medical problems.

One day, Hughes told Shuler about a disastrous experience he had looking after his two children in the absence of his wife, which Shuler found hilarious. After Hughes asked if that could make a good movie, she replied that "it sure sounds funny to me". Hughes wrote the film and flew to Los Angeles to rewrite the script with Shuler.

  The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005, to December 18, 2014, for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. The Colbert Report is a spin-off of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, in which Colbert acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character. The program was created by Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Ben Karlin. The show's writing was grounded in improvisation, and often lampooned current events stories. The show's structure also included a guest interview, in

  In the show's series premiere, Colbert welcomed actor George Clooney and politician Jeb Bush, thanked former host David Letterman, and joined singer Mavis Staples and numerous other musicians for a rendition of Sly and the Family Stone's "Everyday People." The episode nearly missed its broadcast due to technical difficulties. An early interview with Vice President Joe Biden received particular acclaim. Following the terrorist attacks in Paris that November, Colbert devoted his program to that city. A special football-themed episode aired as the lead-out program for Super Bowl 50 in 2016, featuring guests President Barack Obama (in a taped segment), Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, Will Ferrell, and Megyn Kelly.

  talk shows, which may have led to CBS' decision to pick a younger replacement for Letterman to compete with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In addition, Colbert's previous program did well among college students and young men 18–34, which are prime target audiences for late-night comedy programming. On April 3, 2014, Letterman announced his retirement, with his final episode as host of Late Show scheduled for May 20, 2015. On April 10, 2014, CBS announced Stephen Colbert as Letterman's successor, signing him to a five-year agreement.

  Who Made Huckabee?, also known as the Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud, refers to a mock rivalry that occurred among late night talk show hosts Stephen Colbert, Conan O'Brien and Jon Stewart in early 2008, reportedly over who was responsible for then–presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's success in the presidential primaries. In reality, however, the feud was concocted by the three comedians as a result of the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Without writers to fuel their banter, the three comedians staged a crossover/rivalry in order to fill airtime and garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert made the claim that because of "the Colbert bump" in popularity which results from guest appearances on his show, he was responsible

Colbert's performances during these episodes were critically praised for their return to an emphasis on news-oriented comedy similar to The Colbert Report and The Daily Show. On November 8, 2016, Colbert presented a live, election night special for CBS's sister premium channel Showtime, Stephen Colbert's Live Election Night: Democracy's Series Finale: Who's Going to Clean Up This Shit?

  1788 species name in Arenaria published by Albrecht Wilhelm Roth, who intended to move Linnaeus' variety to a full species. Roth was unaware that Carlo Allioni had previously, in 1785, elevated the variety to Arenaria marina, so Roth's name is now considered a homonym. Besser's name Spergularia marina is now considered to be based on Allioni's name and consequently on Linnaeus' variety name; it brings nomenclatural priority from 1785. A further error that has caused authors to come to different conclusions about the correct name for the species, is a name thought to have been published by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776. That phantom name came about because Carl Friedrich von Ledebour cited it after misreading Arenaria maritima as A. marina.

  Exercise is also an important therapeutic treatment for patients who have cardiovascular diseases. A systematic review of 63 studies found that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improved cardiovascular function. These studies consisted of various forms of aerobic exercise at a range of intensities (from 50 to 95% VO2), over a multitude of time periods (1–47 months). Overall, exercise significantly reduced CVD-related mortality, decreased risk of MI, and improved quality of life. Another study looked specifically in patients with atherosclerosis post-revascularization surgery. Patients who underwent 60 min of exercise per day on a cycle ergometer for 4 weeks had an increase blood flow reserve (29%) and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. A recent study provided personalized aerobic exercise rehabilitation programs for patients who had an

  Exertion, physiologically, can be described by the initiation of exercise, or, intensive and exhaustive physical activity that causes cardiovascular stress or a sympathetic nervous response. This can be continuous or intermittent exertion. Exertion requires, of the body, modified oxygen uptake, increased heart rate, and autonomic monitoring of blood lactate concentrations. Mediators of physical exertion include cardio-respiratory and musculoskeletal strength, as well as metabolic capability. This often correlates to an output of force followed by a refractory period of recovery. Exertion is limited by cumulative load and repetitive motions. Muscular energy reserves, or stores for biomechanical exertion, stem from metabolic, immediate production of ATP and increased oxygen consumption. Muscular exertion generated depends on the muscle length and the velocity at which it is able to shorten, or contract. Perceived exertion can be explained as subjective, perceived experience that mediates

  this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. Meta-analyses and systemic reviews have shown that exercise training in heart failure patients is associated with improved quality of life, reduced risk of hospitalization and decreased rates of long-term mortality. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). Other studies have shown that exercise-based rehabilitation at a moderate intensity in heart failure patients improves cardiorespiratory fitness and increases both exercise endurance capacity and VO2max (12–31% increase).

  The benefits of physical exercise, especially aerobic exercise, have positive effects on brain function on multiple fronts, ranging from the molecular to behavioral level. According to a study done by the Department of Exercise Science at the University of Georgia, even briefly exercising for 20 minutes facilitates information processing and memory functions. Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. It also aids the bodily release of a plethora of hormones, all of which participate in aiding and providing a nourishing environment for the growth of brain cells. Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of

   A warm up generally consists of a gradual increase in intensity in physical activity (a "pulse raiser"), joint mobility exercise, and stretching, followed by the activity. For example, before running or playing an intensive sport, athletes might slowly jog to warm their muscles and increase their heart rate. It is important that warm ups be specific to the activity, so that the muscles to be used are activated. The risks and benefits of combining stretching with warming up are disputable, although it is generally believed that warming up prepares the athlete both mentally and physically.

 Cut your risks of heart attack and stroke with bouts of continuous aerobic exercise. Science shows that the benefits of aerobic exercise also extend to multiple other physical and emotional areas of our health.
Get your heart pumping and enjoy the benefits of aerobic exercise. A dance class is just one of a wide variety of options for aerobic exercise.
Aerobic exercise is continuous physical activity using large muscle groups for a sustained period of time (a minimum of 10 minutes). “Aerobic” means “requiring oxygen,” and aerobic exercise increases your body’s oxygen demand and your heart rate.
“When performing aerobic exercise, you will feel your breathing speed up, your heart rate increase, and your body temperature rise,” says Pamela Geisel, MS, CSCS, a performance specialist at the Tisch Sports Performance Center at the Weill Cornell-affiliated Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS).
Choose an activity you enjoy; if you find an activity boring or unpleasant, you’re not likely to stick with it.
Set aside a regular exercise time.
Get an “exercise buddy”—someone who will exercise with you and help you stay motivated.
Outdoor exercise may be more fun, but bad weather doesn’t need to slow you down. Add a step box, agility ladder, or battle ropes to your arsenal of indoor cardio workout aids, per this TOPS.org post.
During aerobic activities, Geisel explains, your body’s demand for oxygen increases, resulting in an increase in your heart rate in an attempt to meet the oxygen requirement. This increases the blood circulation throughout your body and results in a higher volume of blood being returned to your heart.
This extra “load” causes adaptations in your cardiovascular system that are beneficial for your overall heart health. These benefits include a stronger heart muscle, lower blood pressure, lower resting heart rate, improved cholesterol levels (a decrease in LDL and an increase in HDL), improved blood flow, and a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease.
Along with cardiovascular help, aerobic exercise enhances the function of your respiratory system, since it improves lung capacity. It also has been shown to improve weight management, insulin sensitivity, and bone health. Furthermore, aerobic exercise is an effective way to decrease stress and anxiety.
You don’t have to exercise to the point of exhaustion to achieve the benefits of aerobic exercise. On the other hand, a leisurely stroll around the block won’t boost your heart rate enough to gain aerobic benefits.
Check your heart rate. Moderate intensity is considered 50 to 70 percent of your heart rate maximum. Vigorous intensity is considered 70 to 85 percent of your heart rate maximum. You can calculate your heart rate maximum by subtracting your age from 220;. For example, if you’re 60, your heart rate maximum is 160 (220 minus 60). “Just keep in mind that your heart rate zones can differ based upon genetics, environment, fitness level, and other factors. I recommend seeing a fitness professional to help tailor some specific heart rate zones for you,” advises Geisel.
Use the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). The Borg RPE scale is a tool that measures your intensity on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 feeling like you are lying in bed and 10 feeling like you are sprinting from a bear. Moderate intensity is often considered a 4-6, and vigorous intensity is often considered 7-9.

  have examined the effects of high-intensity exercise on patients with heart failure. A recent study found that 12 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) in heart failure patients (with reduced ejection fraction) was well-tolerated and had similar benefits compared to patients who underwent moderate continuous exercise (MCE) training, including improved left ventricular remodeling and aerobic capacity. A separate study found that 4 weeks of HIIT in heart failure patients with preserved ejection fraction improved VO2peak and reduced diastolic dysfunction compared to both pre-training values and compared to the MCE group. These studies indicate that both moderate and high intensity exercise training improve cardiovascular function in heart failure patients, likely related to increased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and improved aerobic capacity.

  myocardial infarction for 1 year after a coronary intervention surgery. The patients who underwent the exercise rehabilitation program had increased ejection fraction (60.81 vs. 53% control group), increased exercise tolerance, and reduced cardiovascular risk factors 6 months after starting the exercise rehabilitation program. This improvement in cardiovascular health in patients with atherosclerosis or post-MI is likely the result of increased myocardial perfusion in response to exercise, however more research is required to fully understand these mechanisms. One defining characteristic of heart failure is exercise intolerance, which resulted in a prescription of bed rest for these patients until the 1950s. However, it has now been shown that a monitored rehabilitation program using moderate intensity exercise is safe for heart failure patients,

  Caffeine may cause or exacerbate panic anxiety. Anxiety can temporarily increase during withdrawal from caffeine and various other drugs. Increased and regimented aerobic exercise such as running has been shown to have a positive effect on combating panic anxiety. There is evidence that suggests that this effect is correlated to the release of exercise-induced endorphins and the subsequent reduction of the stress hormone cortisol. There remains a chance of panic symptoms becoming triggered or being made worse due to increased respiration rate that occurs during aerobic exercise. This increased respiration rate can lead to hyperventilation and hyperventilation syndrome, which mimics symptoms of a heart attack, thus inducing a panic attack. The benefits of incorporating an exercise regimen have shown the best results when paced accordingly. Muscle relaxation techniques are useful to some individuals. These can be learned using recordings, videos, or books. While muscle relaxation has proved to be less effective than cognitive-behavioral therapies in controlled trials, many people still find at least temporary relief from muscle relaxation.

 Regular aerobic exercise has several physiological effects on the skeletal muscles and the heart. In terms of skeletal muscles, endurance training leads to the development of increased numbers of mitochondria, which are responsible for producing ATP, the energy currency of the cell. This increase in mitochondria enhances the capacity of slow muscle fibers to use fat as a fuel and improves the efficiency of metabolism. Additionally, glycogen stores in the muscles enlarge, and the ability to produce ATP is increased.

In regards to the heart, regular aerobic exercise can have a dramatic impact. It does not change the maximum heart rate, but it does increase the volume of blood that the heart can pump with each beat, known as the stroke volume. Trained athletes have been found to pump more blood each minute compared to their untrained counterparts due to the increased stroke volume. This is made possible by the enlargement of the heart, as revealed by techniques like echocardiography. Marathon runners and even ordinary individuals who engage in aerobic exercise experience an increase in heart size.

Furthermore, regular aerobic exercise leads to a decrease in resting pulse or heart rate. The increased stroke volume allows the heart to supply the same amount of blood with each beat, resulting in a slower resting heart rate. This decrease in resting heart rate is beneficial as it provides a greater margin before reaching the maximum heart rate during exercise. Trained athletes may have resting heart rates as low as 40 or 50 beats per minute, compared to the average of 70 beats per minute in untrained individuals. Even minimal training, such as five minutes of rope skipping every day for a month, can lower the resting pulse.

Overall, regular aerobic exercise positively impacts skeletal muscles by increasing their mitochondrial capacity and metabolic efficiency. It also has significant effects on the heart, including an increase in stroke volume, enlargement of the heart, and a decrease in resting heart rate. These adaptations allow trained individuals to deliver more oxygen to their muscles and enhance their overall exercise performance.

Aerobic exercise is continuous physical activity using large muscle groups for a sustained period of time (a minimum of 10 minutes). “Aerobic” means “requiring oxygen,” and aerobic exercise increases your body’s oxygen demand and your heart rate. “When performing aerobic exercise, you will feel your breathing speed up, your heart rate increase, and your body temperature rise,” says Pamela Geisel, MS, CSCS, a performance specialist at the Tisch Sports Performance Center at the Weill Cornell-affiliated Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). During aerobic activities, Geisel explains, your body’s demand for oxygen increases, resulting in an increase in your heart rate in an attempt to meet the oxygen requirement. These benefits include a stronger heart muscle, lower blood pressure, lower resting heart rate, improved cholesterol levels (a decrease in LDL and an increase in HDL), improved blood flow, and a decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. Along with cardiovascular help, aerobic exercise enhances the function of your respiratory system, since it improves lung capacity. It also has been shown to improve weight management, insulin sensitivity, and bone health. You don’t have to exercise to the point of exhaustion to achieve the benefits of aerobic exercise. On the other hand, a leisurely stroll around the block won’t boost your heart rate enough to gain aerobic benefits. Moderate intensity is often considered a 4-6, and vigorous intensity is often considered 7-9.

2024-06-11 18:13:30 [WARNING] icl_gen_inferencer: ??????????????final prompt:Background:Regular aerobic exercise has several physiological effects on the skeletal muscles and the heart. This increase in mitochondria enhances the capacity of slow muscle fibers to use fat as a fuel and improves the efficiency of metabolism. Additionally, glycogen stores in the muscles enlarge, and the ability to produce ATP is increased. Marathon runners and even ordinary individuals who engage in aerobic exercise experience an increase in heart size. Furthermore, regular aerobic exercise leads to a decrease in resting pulse or heart rate. Overall, regular aerobic exercise positively impacts skeletal muscles by increasing their mitochondrial capacity and metabolic efficiency. It also has significant effects on the heart, including an increase in stroke volume, enlargement of the heart, and a decrease in resting heart rate. These adaptations allow trained individuals to deliver more oxygen to their muscles and enhance their overall exercise performance. this has now become an important therapeutic for patients with heart failure. One study of heart failure patients found that aerobic exercise (walking or cycling) at 60–70% of heart rate reserve 3–5 times per week for over 3 years led to improved health and overall quality of life (determined by a self-reported Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire, a 23-question disease-specific questionnaire). There remains a chance of panic symptoms becoming triggered or being made worse due to increased respiration rate that occurs during aerobic exercise. The benefits of incorporating an exercise regimen have shown the best results when paced accordingly. Exercise affects the brain on multiple fronts. It increases heart rate, which pumps more oxygen to the brain. Exercise stimulates the brain plasticity by stimulating growth of new connections between cells in a wide array of

   Screenwriter Corey Goodman was largely influenced by talks with Vin Diesel, specifically about his Dungeons & Dragons witch hunter character. Initially Timur Bekmambetov was to direct but was later replaced by Breck Eisner and Goodman's script was re-written by D.W. Harper before Melisa Wallack was brought on to work on the film's script. Both were uncredited. The production filed for a film tax credit in Pennsylvania and was allocated a tax credit of $14 million. In February 2014, Vin Diesel posted a photo of the film's concept artwork to his Facebook page and Lionsgate CEO Jon Feitheimer commented that if successful, The Last Witch Hunter could become a film franchise. In March 2014, Lakeshore Entertainment boarded the film as co-financier with Lionsgate, but

The animation on the short was groundbreaking, featuring the first use of motion blur in CG animation and complex 3D backgrounds, where the lighting styles and colors were inspired by Maxfield Parrish, made using particle systems. Lasseter pushed the envelope by asking for manipulatable shapes capable of the squash and stretch style, as earlier CG models had generally been restricted to rigid geometric shapes. It was rendered on a Cray X-MP/48 supercomputer and ten VAX-11/750 superminicomputers from Project Athena. The film's soundtrack was partially produced by SoundDroid.

Roberts also appeared in two films: Lymelife, which was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival, and The Flight Before Christmas, where she had her voiceover debut when she voiced the English version of the character Wilma. In 2009, Roberts starred alongside Jake T. Austin in Hotel for Dogs, based on the novel by Lois Duncan. The film premiered in January 2009, and took fifth place in its opening weekend with over $17 million. The film has to-date grossed over $114 million, and received generally mixed reviews from critics. She also appeared that year in The Winning Season, portraying Abbie Miller.

  A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

  It is often seen as a repetitive stress injury, and thus lifestyle modification is typically the basic course of management strategies. For example, a person should begin doing foot and calf workouts. Strong muscles in the calves and lower legs will help take the stress off the bone and prevent heel spurs. Icing the area is an effective way to get immediate pain relief. There are several means to get pain relief from plantar heel pain. Plantar heel pain can be a precursor to many pathologies of the foot. There is evidence that corticosteroid injections may reduce pain for up to one month after the injection, which can have an impact on the formation of calcaneal spurs. Side effects of corticosteroid injections includes peripheral nerve injury, plantar fascia rupture, and post injection flare, among others. Laser therapy, dry needling, and calcaneal taping are also utilized in treating plantar heel pain, however, there is not high quality evidence supporting the clinical usage of such modalities in reduction of pain.

  Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of calcaneal spurs. When stress is put on the plantar fascia ligament, it does not cause only plantar fasciitis, but causes a heel spur where the plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. The considerations that affect plantar heel pain are the alignment of the foot with lower leg, foot and ankle mobility, strength and endurance of muscle. External influences on plantar heel pain are the amount of time spent on feet while exercising or standing, type of footwear used and type of floor surfaces. Calcaneal spur develops when proper care is not given to the foot and heels. People who are obese, have flat feet, or who often wear high-heeled shoes are most susceptible to heel spurs. Flat feet can potentially be attributed to the minimal amount of ankle dorsiflexion during stance phase of the gait cycle causing more tension on the plantar fascia.

 Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. Initially, these deposits may not have any impact on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity.

There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts.

While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. This can lead to persistent pain and difficulty walking or standing for long periods.

In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. This can cause discomfort or pain when wearing shoes or participating in activities that involve ankle movement. In such cases, surgical removal of the spur may be considered as part of treatment for insertional Achilles tendonitis.

It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.

 In the conventional or allopathic system of medicine there is no cure for heel pain or calcaneal spur or heel spur. In conventional medicine treatment is designed to decrease the inflammation and avoid re-injures.
The patients are treated with pain killers such as ibuprofen or periodical injection of cortisone in the affected region. Sometimes surgical removal may require if calcaneal spur or heel spur is very large and if the symptoms do not reduce with medicines.
Over-the-counter or prescription of anti-inflammatory medications can help temporarily, but can cause side effects also. Prolonged use of the medicines causes significant gastrointestinal upset, ulceration and bleeding. The side effects of steroids injected in the affected area can be serious and can actually worsen symptoms. Complications can include fat necrosis (death of fatty tissue) of the heel and rupture of the plantar fascia.
Sometimes bone spurs can be surgically removed or an operation to loosen the fascia - called a plantar fascia release - can be performed. This surgery is about 80 percent effective in the small group of individuals who do not have relief with conservative treatment, but symptoms may return if preventative measures (wearing proper footwear, shoe inserts, stretching, etc) are not maintained.
In contrast, homeopathy is a natural form of medicine. In a typical case of healing, a person's complete symptoms will be treated all together.
While prescribing a drug a complete history of the patient is taken which includes the medical history of the patient, physical and mental constitution and genetic predisposition to the disease. A properly prescribed homeopathic remedy can lower the progression of disease and in highly susceptible people can prevent the occurrence or prolong the onset of disease.
Homeopathy offers a treatment which is safe, gentle and will not end up with side effects. The allopathic medicines might provide immediate relief from the symptoms but the root cause of the problem is not touched upon and the dangerous side effects can be worse than the original symptoms. The treatment works at the deeper level of immunity and enhances the healing capacity of the body. Homeopathy medicines improve the resistance of the body.
It helps to reduce the inflammation of the affected area.
The remedies helps to reduce the pain in the affected area. Thus reducing the need for strong painkillers.
It can save you from a surgeon’s knife.
The treatment helps to strengthen your calf muscles so that calf muscles bear the maximum weight of your body.
It offers you a promising treatment and you do not have to continue medicines for your whole life. With certain life style changes and homeopathic medications heel pain or heel spur can be treated effectively.
There are 17 homoeopathic medicines which give great relief in heel pain or calcaneal or heel spur. However, the correct choice and the resulting relief is a matter of experience and right judgment on the part of the doctor. The treatment is decided after thorough case taking of the patient. Thus remedies are tailor made unlike allopathy in which all patients receive the same surgery or drugs although trade name may be different.
A calcaneal spur is a small bony projection that is formed on the calcaneus or heel bone. It is caused by putting too much pressure on the sinew on the soles of the feet, usually over a long period of time. Spurs at the back of the heel are associated with inflammation of the Achilles tendon (Achilles tendinitis) and cause tenderness and pain at the back of the heel that is made worse by pushing off the ball of the foot.
Spurs under the sole (plantar area) are associated with inflammation of the plantar fascia (the "bowstring-like" tissue stretching from the heel underneath the sole) and cause localized tenderness and pain made worse by stepping down on the heel.
Not all heel spurs cause symptoms. Some are discovered on xrays taken for other purposes. Heel spurs and plantar fasciitis can occur alone or be related to underlying diseases which cause arthritis (inflammation of the joints) such as Reiter's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis.
Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by a radiological examination (x-ray). Heel spurs are most often seen in middle aged men and women, but can be found in all age groups.
Calcaneal spur develops due to many reasons like using improper foot wear, sudden increase in daily activities, weight gain, plantar fasciitis, where the plantar fascia that is present at the arch of the foot gets inflamed with calcium deposits and due to weak calf muscles that put pressure on the foot.
Plantar fasciitis - "itis" indicates the inflammation of the tissue (plantar fascia) at the arch of the foot.
The causes can range from excessive walking (especially if unaccustomed to walking), running or jumping to improperly fitted or wornout shoes. Runners, volleyball players, and tennis players, people who do step aerobics or stair climbing for exercise, those with flat feet, pregnant women, the obese and diabetics and those who wear tight fitting shoes with a high heel are all prone to developing spurs (and plantar fasciitis) more readily.
Every time you take a step, one of your heels has to support the whole weight of your body. As you move, the load is equal to 20 times your own body weight. The load is softened by a pillow of fat under the heel and a large sinew under the sole of the foot.
If an athlete does not warm up properly or a person with a sedentary job exercises heavily during the weekends, they might overload the muscles of the calf or the Achilles tendon. These are also fixed on the heel bone. When the muscles of the calf or Achilles tendon are overloaded there will be extra strain on the sinew and muscles in the soles of the foot. The overload can cause inflammation and even small cracks in the sinew.
Every time you sit down, sleep or otherwise rest your legs, the muscles of the sole of the foot will contract in an attempt to protect the damaged sinew. The pain in the heel will then no longer be felt. But when you get up again the pain will return and when you move again, the sinew will crack even more. To compensate for the repeated damage to the sinew, the body will try and repair it in the same way that it would attempt to repair a broken bone, namely, by wrapping it up in bone. The result is a small bony projection on the heel bone called a calcaneal spur. But it is not the spur itself that causes the pain. The spur is the result of a prolonged overload of the sinew at the sole of the foot.
Though all the people with spurs do not have heel pain, severe foot pain on standing is the main symptom of a calcaneal spur. The pain is more in the morning and decreases with activity. The spur forms due to the deposition of calcium near the plantar fascia. The heel pain arises due to the spur pricking the surrounding tissue. The heel pain has been depicted as toothache in the foot.
A sharp, stabbing pain under or on the inside of the heel.
Most sufferers are people who are overweight and middle aged. This is due to the shock absorbing fat pillow under the foot shrinking over the years and becoming less effective.
People who have feet that are pronated and not corrected. Pronated means that the foot tends to roll inwards when a person walks or runs.
Calcaneal or heel spurs are usually diagnosed by the symptoms revealed during a clinical examination. Heel bone spurs can be diagnosed with an x-ray foot where a bony outgrowth can be seen at the calcaneal bone near the attachment of plantar fascia. Radiological proof helps exclude other conditions like arthritis, stress fractures and so on.
Once a calcaneal spur develops it can be a difficult condition to treat. However, many cases involve only minor ligament damage, which is relieved in a matter of weeks or months.
Prevention by taking early corrective measures against any predisposing factors will improve the longterm prognosis.
Shoes are a must to support the arch of the foot even when at home. Arch supports and heel cups cushion the heel and reduce the weight bearing on the foot during activities.
The intensity and duration of activity and weight bearing should be reduced. Staying off the feet can help a lot.
The workout regimen should consist of mild stretches for strengthening of foot and calf muscles so as to reduce the tension on the heel mechanically.
Rolling an ice bottle under the foot can reduce acute pain. In chronic cases heat application also helps reduce the symptoms.
Losing weight can reduce the extra pressure that plantar fascia bears with every step.
It must be used to avoid recurrence of spurs.

Patients may have symptoms of neurogenic heel pain mixed with objective findings of plantar fasciitis, such as US findings of hypoechoic and thickened (>4 mm) plantar fascia [13]. However, the presence of signs of plantar fasciitis does not rule out an entrapment neuropathy. Electrodiagnostic testing is inconsistent in the diagnosis of ICN entrapment [34–36]. Chundru et al. [6] reviewed the MRIs of 100 patients with heel pain and AbDM atrophy and then matched them with an equal number of patients with heel pain and no AbDM atrophy. There were significantly more patients with advanced age, calcaneal spurs, and plantar fasciitis in the group whose MRIs showed AbDM atrophy. However, selective atrophy of the AbDM is not rare; it was seen in 6 % of 602 foot and ankle MRIs, and only one of those patients was thought to have ICN dysfunction [33]. Thus, AbDM atrophy is suggestive of but not specific for ICN dysfunction. Precise injection of a small amount of local anesthetic at the ICN may assist the clinician in determining whether the patient would benefit from its ablation (see section below "Neurolytic techniques").Initial treatment is similar for both conditions, including correction of passive mechanics of the foot with orthotics when needed, proper shoes, weight reduction, and stretching the plantar fascia and Achilles tendon.

  Conditioned play audiometry (CPA) is a type of audiometry done in children from ages 2 to 5 years old, in developmental age. It is the test that directly follows visual reinforcement audiometry when the child becomes able to focus on a task. It is a type of behavioral hearing test, of which there are many. Conditioned play audiometry uses toys to direct the child's attention on the listening task and turns it into a game. Instead of raising one's hand in response to the sound, as an adult would, the child might drop a toy into a bucket every time he or she hears a sound. This keeps the child interested in the listening task for longer. Common games include dropping

 1 -0.03253  A calcaneal spur (also known as a heel spur) is a bony outgrowth from the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). Calcaneal spurs are typically detected by x-ray examination. It is a form of exostosis. When a foot is exposed to constant stress, calcium deposits build up on the bottom of the heel bone. Generally, this has no effect on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause these deposits to pile up on each other, causing a spur-shaped deformity, called a calcaneal (or heel) spur. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the inferior aspect of the calcaneus and is typically a response to plantar fasciitis over a period, but may also be associated with ankylosing spondylitis (typically in children). A posterior calcaneal spur develops on the back of the heel at the insertion of the Achilles tendon. An inferior calcaneal spur consists of a calcification of the calcaneus, which lies superior to the plantar fascia at the insertion of the plantar fascia. A posterior calcaneal spur is often large and palpable through the skin and may need to be removed as part of the treatment of insertional Achilles tendonitis.

 3 -0.05869 Calcaneal spurs, also known as heel spurs, are bony outgrowths that form on the calcaneal tuberosity (heel bone). They are typically detected through x-ray examination. The formation of calcaneal spurs is a result of calcium deposits building up on the bottom of the heel bone in response to constant stress on the foot. Initially, these deposits may not have any impact on a person's daily life. However, repeated damage can cause the deposits to accumulate and form a spur-shaped deformity.

There are two types of calcaneal spurs: inferior and posterior. An inferior calcaneal spur is located on the lower aspect of the heel bone and is often associated with plantar fasciitis, which is inflammation of the plantar fascia. It can also be seen in children with ankylosing spondylitis. On the other hand, a posterior calcaneal spur develops at the back of the heel where the Achilles tendon inserts.

While calcaneal spurs themselves may not always cause complications or symptoms, they can contribute to certain conditions. For example, an inferior calcaneal spur can exacerbate plantar fasciitis symptoms by causing irritation and inflammation in the surrounding tissues. This can lead to persistent pain and difficulty walking or standing for long periods.

In some cases, a posterior calcaneal spur may become large enough to be felt through the skin. This can cause discomfort or pain when wearing shoes or participating in activities that involve ankle movement. In such cases, surgical removal of the spur may be considered as part of treatment for insertional Achilles tendonitis.

It's important to note that while calcaneal spurs are commonly associated with certain conditions like plantar fasciitis and insertional Achilles tendonitis, they do not always cause symptoms or require treatment. Proper diagnosis and evaluation by a healthcare professional is necessary to determine if treatment is needed and to develop an appropriate management plan.

  America, opening for Slayer. Lemmy admits that the album was a mistake and failed sales-wise, but considers it to be "all right" and believes it was the mix that let them down, explaining: ""..We had Guy Bidmead mix it because we wanted to give him another try, mainly because he had been Vic Maile's boy and Vic was a great live mixer.

  learned "on the job", yet it also meant he had no preconceived attitudes about the instrument's traditional rhythm section role. In his autobiography, he credits Jack Casady (who was playing with Jefferson Airplane) as a confirming influence on the direction his instincts were leading him into. While he has said that his playing style was influenced more by Bach counterpoint than by contemporaneous rock and soul bass players, one can also hear the fluidity and power of a jazz bassist such as Charles Mingus or Jimmy Garrison in Lesh's work, along with stylistic allusions to Casady. Lesh has also cited Jack Bruce of Cream as an influence.

  William Frederick Gibbons (born December 16, 1949) is an American rock musician who is the guitarist and primary vocalist of ZZ Top. He began his career in the Moving Sidewalks, who recorded Flash (1968) and opened four dates for the Jimi Hendrix Experience. Gibbons formed ZZ Top in late 1969 and released ZZ Top's First Album in early 1971. Gibbons possesses a gravelly bass-baritone singing voice and is known for his bluesy, groove based guitar style. He is also noted, along with ZZ Top bassist Dusty Hill, for his chest-length beard. Gibbons has made appearances with other artists and acted on television shows, most notably Bones. In 2001, Rolling Stone named him the 32nd greatest guitarist of all time.

In addition to Black, Lemmy, Judas Priest's Rob Halford, The Runaways' Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne provide character voices for these lines. Schafer's original vision for the game had not anticipated a celebrity cast. In particular, though Eddie came to resemble Black, the team had not planned on having Jack Black voice the character. After learning that Black was a fan of Schafer's previous game, Psychonauts, they met with the actor/musician and recognized he was an avid gamer and metal fan and understood all the choices the team made in the game, and subsequently signed on for the voice

According to the group's producer John Schroeder, who wrote the booklet notes for the 3-CD compilation The Early Years, Lynes was 'the quietest member of the group' and 'somehow always seemed to be the odd one out'. He had fallen in love on tour, claiming he could see how serious the other band members (Lancaster, Francis Rossi, Rick Parfitt and John Coghlan) were about fame and glory, and that he just wanted to settle down to a life with his newfound love. "I was shocked, but Roy was like that," recalled Rossi in 2001.

  Moe was the first voice Hank Azaria performed for the show. During the time of his audition, Azaria was doing a play in which he had the part of a drug dealer, basing his voice on actor Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon. He used the same voice in the audition, and was told by Matt Groening and Sam Simon, who were directing him, to make it more gravelly like Deutsch's voice. Groening and Simon thought that it was perfect and took Azaria over to the Fox network recording studio. The result is Moe's pronounced New York accent. Before he had even seen a script, Azaria recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode "Some Enchanted Evening". Moe was originally voiced by actor Christopher Collins. Hank Azaria explained that he did not discover this fact for several years, and it was explained that Collins' acting was fine, but other staff and actors found Collins unpleasant to work with. Collins recorded several lines as Moe which never aired.

He also talked about the creative freedom he had in the studio saying "That creative freedom is not something that was granted to me, it's something that has always been mine. I'm the one that chooses whether or not I give that up. Nobody comes and demands that I give it up.

  Allan's voice is described as "raspy and unpolished." The New York Times describes his music as "elegant, often deadpan songs [that] tend toward manly understatement." His sound is influenced by the Bakersfield scene, especially Buck Owens and Merle Haggard. He prefers this sound to that of the more pop country that is prevalent on country radio, because "the songs have got to have soul, have real meaning....Country music is...what happens during the week. Rock 'n roll is about what happens at the weekend." Because his sound is different from many of the current crop of country singers, as their sound is considerably more pop or rock, Allan has, at times had difficulty getting radio to play his singles. He says he has to "walk a real fine line" to "make sure that I get traditional stuff on the radio."

Kearney decided to stay in Nashville to record a few demos with Marvin and after a few months, Kearney had no plans on returning. "By the end of the summer, we had three or four songs and I realized this is what I wanted to do. It just clicked. So I called home to Oregon and said, 'I'm not coming back' and I never left Nashville."

  in the Japanese version. He returns in Kingdom Hearts II and is voiced in the English version by Doug Erholtz, who said he had a "fun journey" voicing Leon and that it was a "really fun role to play". For the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura decided to use Squall as a mentor character to newcomer Sora. Event planner Jun Akiyama persuaded Nomura to change Squall's name to Leon. Meanwhile, some parts of his design were changed to reference Rinoa's, most noticeably the wings in his jacket. Although polygons were used alongside other returning Final Fantasy characters, Leon could not return in Kingdom Hearts III which bothered many of the staff members.

  scene work. During one of the cutscenes of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall is impaled by Edea Kramer in battle, creating the theory that Squall dies from the attack and the rest of the game takes place in his dream. When asked about this, Kitase laughed and debunked this theory but he found it interesting; if the game was ever remade, he might think of changing elements of the story. While Final Fantasy VIII does not use voice acting, Squall has a voice in the Square Enix series Kingdom Hearts, in which he is known as Leon. He is voiced by David Boreanaz in the English version of the game and Hideo

Although the weapon was intended as a novel way for players to control weapons in battle, Nomura said he feels it looks odd in retrospect and that it was very difficult to master. Square's Hiroki Chiba said the scene in which Squall and Rinoa embrace in space is his favorite in the Final Fantasy franchise due to the use of Faye Wong's song "Eyes On Me" in the background and because he had to adjust every frame to make

In both games, Sora, Donald, and Goofy prove Alice's innocence by defeating the Trickmaster Heartless, the real culprit. The Queen congratulates Sora for solving the mystery, and once again demonstrates her bi-polar personality by pardoning Alice.

   Animation is a method in which figures are manipulated to appear as moving images. In traditional animation, images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent celluloid sheets to be photographed and exhibited on film. Today, most animations are made with computer-generated imagery (CGI). Computer animation can be very detailed 3D animation, while 2D computer animation (which may have the look of traditional animation) can be used for stylistic reasons, low bandwidth, or faster real-time renderings. Other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and three-dimensional objects like paper cutouts, puppets, or clay figures. An animated cartoon is an animated film, usually a short film aimed at children and featuring an exaggerated

  style. The style takes inspiration from comic strips, often featuring anthropomorphic animals, superheroes, or the adventures of child protagonists. Especially with animals that form a natural predator/prey relationship (e.g. cats and mice, coyotes and birds) the action often centers around violent pratfalls such as falls, collisions and explosions that would be lethal in real life. Commonly, animators achieved the effect by a rapid succession of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusion—as in motion pictures in general—is thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement, but the exact causes are still uncertain. Analog mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phénakisticope, zoetrope, flip book,

  Hammerhead Productions, both starting mid-90s. The first step is identifying suitable features that the software tracking algorithm can lock onto and follow. Typically, features are chosen because they are bright or dark spots, edges or corners, or a facial feature—depending on the particular tracking algorithm being used. When a feature is tracked it becomes a series of 2D coordinates that represent the position of the feature across the series of frames. Such tracks can be used immediately for 2D motion tracking, or then be used to calculate 3D information. In 3D tracking, a process known as "calibration" derives the motion of the camera from the inverse-projection of the 2D paths, and from this a "reconstruction" process is used to recreate the photographed subject from

Rowan has resisted torture, refusing to break. But when the Spanish bring in Maderos, whom they have captured, she tries to persuade him to end his suffering and reveal the message. He still resists, holding out long enough for the Cuban rebels to launch a major assault on the Spanish position. Dory rescues Rowan but is killed in the process. Rowan, however, is then able to present McKinley's letter to Garcia, who tells him "This message means the liberation of our people."

Duncan".... but finds when opening them that they all start with "Dear Doris" and are not meant for him. While his friends Josh Pinto and Ruth Rose Hathaway think it is someone's idea of a joke, Dink suspects that there is more to it than that. His suspicions are practically confirmed when Doris Duncan herself shows up one day to acquire the letters and demands them immediately. Not knowing that Ruth Rose's little brother Nate took the letters unaware that they were something important, Dink apologizes to Ms. Duncan, who then leaves in an unpleasant mood. Dink and his friends investigate the letters, uncover a code in the wording, and find a valuable stamp concealed in one of the envelopes hidden under a worthless stamp. Then the owner of the valuable stamp comes to get it back.

Mohamed comes home to find her waiting at the door subsequently, their thoughts are that law enforcement will capture them, so they go on the run.

  lesbian subtext between Faith and Buffy; Jane Espenson states that Whedon says he didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious. With Faith, the writers explored the nature of power, and the boundaries and consequences of its use. They wanted to address the issue that, whether the creatures a Slayer kills are good or evil, she is still a professional killer. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, and writer of Faith-centric episodes such as "Revelations" and "Bad Girls", says one of the things he loves about the character is that Faith is not wrong in describing herself and Buffy as killers. He goes

Kuzui served as an executive producer on the TV series and its spin-off Angel, having packaged Buffy along with Kaz Kuzui, Sandollar TV's Gail Berman and Sandy Gallin. Along with husband Kaz Kuzui, she founded Kuzui Enterprises, a leader in independent film distribution in Japan that distributes U.S. films there and imports Japanese films for the U.S. market. In 2003, the Kuzuis were among the executive producers for the Thai-Japanese film Last Life in

  such as vampires and demons. Created as a foil to the protagonist, Buffy Summers, she is a Slayer who comes from a damaged background and often makes the wrong decision. Initially an ally to the main characters, events take a toll on Faith's sanity and she slips into a villainous role. Later storylines show her feeling remorse for her past crimes, and with the benevolent vampire Angel's help she eventually rejoins the side of good in the hopes of achieving redemption. Eliza Dushku later portrayed Echo in the television series Dollhouse, also created by Joss Whedon and produced by Jane Espenson.

  Joss Whedon says of this episode, "This was not the final grace note after a symphony, the way the Buffy finale was. We are definitely still in the thick of it. But the point of the show is that you're never done; no matter who goes down, the fight goes on." Whedon says that Angel is about redemption, "something you fight for every day, so I wanted him to go out fighting. People kept calling it a cliffhanger. I was like, 'Are you mad, sir? Don't you see that that is the final statement?'" Producer David Fury agrees, saying it was "the perfect way to end the series, and anybody who says otherwise is dumb." The central theme of Angel, Fury explains, is that "the fight never ends...You can't ever win but the fight is worth fighting. Any proper resolution of, 'Oh, we've defeated the demons, they've gone back to hell, let's get a beer,' just would have been absolutely wrong for that show." Part of Angel's story, Fury says, is that "everybody that he's ever been close to dies...he will always outlive the people he cares about."

  Buffy the Vampire Slayer was first created by Joss Whedon as a feature film in 1992. Unhappy with the film, Whedon later revived for television the concept of an adolescent girl who is given superhuman powers by mystical forces to defeat evil. The film only touches on the adult world surrounding Buffy Summers, while the series explores it in greater depth. Originally trained as a dancer who toured and appeared in music videos with Prince, Robia LaMorte won the part of Jenny Calendar.

  Fran Rubel Kuzui is an American film director and producer. She received her master's degree from New York University and was a script supervisor for a decade, prior to her first film, 1988's Tokyo Pop, which she co-wrote and directed. The movie was shown at the 1988 Cannes Film Festival and received critical acclaim for its depiction of an American woman trying to make sense of the Japanese youth culture. However, she's best known as the director of the 1992 film Buffy the Vampire Slayer, whose original screenplay was the basis for the television series of the same name. She

  The initial concept for Faith's character was "the road not taken", a Slayer who makes the wrong choices in life. She is intended to be a reflection of Buffy, and what Buffy could have become were it not for her support system of friends and family. The question the writers wanted to answer was, despite being made from the same "raw materials," how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life? Joss Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never let herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself. Some fans argued that the show developed

  to finish it. Deadline pressures and a desire for consistency in the look of a feature led to having one artist pencil a feature while one or more other artists inked it. At Marvel Comics, where the pencil artist was responsible for the frame-by-frame breakdown of the story plot, an artist who was skilled in story-telling would be encouraged to do as many books as possible, maximizing the number of books he could do by leaving the inking to others. By contrast, at other companies where the writer did the frame-by-frame breakdown in script form, more artists inked or even lettered their own work. Joe Kubert and Jim

  For a long time, inking was considered a minor part of the comics industry, only marginally above lettering in the pecking order. In the early days of comic books, many publishers hired "packagers" to produce entire books. Although some "star" creators' names (such as Simon and Kirby or Bob Kane) usually appeared at the beginning of each story, the publisher generally didn't care which artists worked on the book. Packagers instituted an assembly line style method of creating books, using top talents like Kirby to create the look and pace of the story and then handing off the inking, lettering, and coloring to largely anonymous — and low-paid —

  Bunker is a fictional superhero of Mexican descent, published by DC Comics. He first appeared in Teen Titans vol. 4, #1 (November 2011), and was created by Scott Lobdell and Brett Booth. Booth said on his blog: "We wanted to show an interesting character whose homosexuality is part of him, not something that’s hidden. Sure there are gay people who you wouldn’t know are gay right off the bat, but there are others who are a more flamboyant, and we thought it would be nice to actually see them portrayed in comics. Did we go over the top, I don’t think so."

  In the late 1990s, Steve Kenson had an idea for a superhero setting that he had been contracted to produce. Through a series of misfortunes, the project fell through and he was left with a partially completed manuscript. Shopping it around to various publishers, none were interested (superhero game popularity had declined at that time) until he talked to Chris Pramas (President of Green Ronin Publishing) about the setting. Pramas made the offer to publish the setting if Kenson would also create a superhero game system based on the d20 System. Kenson agreed and began work.

Rowling's Harry Potter series that is founded by the main characters, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, to stand up against the regime of Hogwarts High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge, as well as to learn practical Defence Against the Dark Arts.

  Rowling omitted his physical description ("a black boy taller than Ron") from the British version of the book following her editor's request to reduce the length of the chapter, but it was included in the American edition. His backstory was originally expanded in Chamber of Secrets, but she ultimately cut it due to her inability to work it into the storyline. In Order of the Phoenix, Dean joins the D.A. and also believes Harry and Dumbledore when they insist that Voldemort has returned; but, when Harry and Seamus engage in a heated row over the Daily Prophets allegations that Harry had merely fabricated the story, Dean refuses to take

He is a Half-blood: his mother is a Muggle and his father was a pure blood wizard who kept his blood status a secret. Dean's father left his family when Dean was very young in an attempt to protect them against the Death Eaters, and was slain when he refused to join them. Dean originally prefers football over Quidditch, and has a West Ham United poster in his dormitory. Dean was subsequently raised by his mother and stepfather, and has several half-brothers and sisters. Dean was named "Gary" in the original drafts of Philosopher's

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, with Harry, Ron and Hermione absent from Hogwarts, Neville, Ginny and Luna begin a covert rebellion against new headmaster Severus Snape by reactivating the D.A. However, Luna is abducted at Christmas and Ginny leaves during Easter, leaving Neville for a few weeks as the D.A.'s leader.

"'I tried to transpose the wizarding world onto a map of the Yiddish-speaking world' — pre World War II — 'without making the characters Jewish. Filch speaks in a thick Lithuanian Yiddish accent and doesn’t pronounce the 'sh' sound, so he says sabes instead of shabes, and Hagrid, who despises him and speaks a very distinct rural English, speaks in a thick, almost exaggerated Polish Yiddish. I thought this was a good approach because it helps show the tension between them. As for Snape and McGonagall, well, they’re Litvaks. They just

  closer and win back Daisy himself. Donald follows them to an amusement park, where he tries several attempts to stop Daisy from falling for the look-alike, but fails at every turn. The final attempt is at the Tunnel of Love, where he begs the look-alike to stop but is pushed underwater. Donald, now soaked and infuriated, storms into the tunnel and a massive and brutal fight ensues offscreen. The camera then zooms to the exit of the tunnel, where it shows Donald and the look-alike holding hands and closing eyes romantically, exiting the tunnel, mistaking each other for Daisy. Both become shocked upon seeing each other and then look back to see Daisy walking out of the tunnel, completely drenched and angrily ranting at them incoherently. Realizing he got the wrong duck, Donald and his look-alike quickly run away as Daisy continues to yell at them.

She also appeared without speaking in the prequel, Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, in Disney Town alongside various other Disney characters and in the final scene of Kingdom Hearts III, where she and Minnie happily reunited with their lovers.

While playing his guitar, he unwittingly goes through a small waterfall. He coughs and shakes water off, and gets a fish in his instrument, but he quickly calms down. However, just as he continues playing he goes over a waterfall and falls to the bottom. After an angry outburst, he emerges from the water with the canoe on his back like a turtle's shell.

  The Kingdom Hearts games contain elements of action role-playing video games with hack-and-slash elements. The games are driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually shown in the form of a cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide bonus benefits to the characters. In most games, the player primarily controls the principal protagonist of the series, Sora. Sora is usually accompanied by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are artificial intelligence-controlled non-playable characters that aid Sora in battle. In the first and third game, their behavior can be altered to suit different combat objectives.

As a response to that, the album includes a new collaboration with Crystal Kay, symbolizing that the "Loves" series started and ends with her. To reflect the fact that this is the last release in the "Loves" series, every track on the album (excluding the interludes), has the word "love" in its title. It was not announced what direction the band would take after this release, though the band stated in an interview that it would not disband. The album was released in CD and CD+DVD formats, a first for an M-Flo release and has 13 tracks, excluding interludes. The DVD contains the videos for the songs "Summer Time Love", "Lotta Love", "Love Song" and "She Loves the Cream", a DVJMIX by DJ Uppercut (a music video remix) and a feature titled "History of M-Flo", which is a mix of their previous works. The limited press edition of the CD+DVD format also has two performances by M-Flo member Verbal and past member, Lisa at Rhythm Nation: "Come Again" and "Been So Long".

The record, however, was never sent to Azalea and on 1 August 2013, she denied that Ora would be collaborating with her on the album. Azalea then met Perry for the first time, as her supporting act at the iTunes Festival that year. At the festival, Perry approached Azalea with an offer to record "Black Widow" as she felt the song would suit her better. Azalea was then invited to Perry's after party that night, where the two exchanged numbers, and Perry sent Azalea the record. When Azalea received the song, it only consisted of a hook and a beat.

During the musical introduction to the song, Holiday stood with her eyes closed, as if she were evoking a prayer. Holiday approached her recording label, Columbia, about the song, but the company feared reaction by record retailers in the South, as well as negative reaction from affiliates of its co-owned radio network, CBS.

  the story "had been emphasized more strongly than any previous title in the series." Ben Moore from GameTrailers gave the game 8.7/10, praising the tech web system, which he described as "the biggest and best addition in the game", as well as the multiplayer aspect, which changed the tone of the game drastically and made the game feel far more unpredictable. He criticized the diplomacy and the AI for being restrictively rigid. Russ Pitts from PC Gamer gave the game 87/100, praising the reactive AI, huge variety of alien lifeforms, as well as the orbital layer, which he described as "a fun, new twist and an engaging tactical element to Civ 5’s already finely tuned tactical game." He criticized

  the player's civilization development. He criticized the unbalanced and non-challenging gameplay, as well as the pared-back culture system, which results in excessive focus on military conquest. Alex Navarro from Giant Bomb gave the game 3/5, criticizing its meaningless and inconsequential choices, which he stated did not really have any significant impact in winning a game. He also criticized the passive AI, gameplay mechanics that rarely work, lack of personality, lack of improvement over the game's predecessor, and too great a similarity to Civilization V in both user interface, pacing, and visual design. He summarized his review by saying that Beyond Earth "itself feels incomplete and regressive compared to the many changes made to  s formula throughout its lifespan."

  game for being too similar to Civilization V, as well as occasionally confusing and anticlimactically concluded quests. He concluded that Beyond Earth had succeeded as it is steeped in the traditions and mechanics of Civilization, but is nevertheless surprising and new in often unexpected ways." Nick Tan from Game Revolution praised the strong contextual setting, but added that several issues from Civilization V have been left unaddressed, such as limited diplomacy and trade between civilizations, as well as the lack of indicators which he stated "plagues the game throughout" and "strains the experience unnecessarily". Dennis Scimeca from The Daily Dot gave the game 4.5/5, praising its consistency within the larger context of the Civilization franchise, and the added level

  structure presented by the quest system. He felt the Affinity system was extraneous, however, and the new layout of the tech tree did not make scientific research markedly different from previous Civilization games. David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game 8/10, praising the familiar Civilization gameplay, rewarding quests, and affinities, which change how players approach the new world's alien resources, but criticizing the game for being too similar to its predecessors, as well as the late game for being less interesting than opening turns. He also stated the game would be incredibly complex for players who are new to the franchise. Nick Capozzoli from GameSpot gave the game 7/10, praising the affinity system and quests, which bring a narrative

  of earth from outer space in a musical piece, but also giving a deeper feel to the song with an extra layer of lyrical meaning. The result was hailed as a masterpiece, being the first game soundtrack to win a Grammy. Some fans of Civilization IV reportedly ended up leaving the menu screen open just to hear the global beat on repeat. When Johnson was asked if Tin was 'as cool in real life as he is on Reddit' Johnson answered simply, "Yes." Civilization IV earned arguably the most critical acclaim of any Civilization game, with many fans believing it to be the best version of Civilization to date, even after two sequels.

  The most widely received of his works was Race (1974). Uncharacteristically for the time, Baker used the traditional categories of physical anthropology and classified human populations in terms of race. Baker rejected the methodological relativism that had characterized anthropology since the days of Franz Boas, instead going back to earlier ideas of hereditarianism and cultural evolution. The book received mixed reviews. In Race, Baker used a restrictive sense of the term "civilization", giving 23 criteria by which civilizations might be identified. Based on these criteria, Baker declared that Mesoamerican societies such as those of the Aztecs and Maya were not civilizations, and that no indigenous civilizations ever arose in Africa. He enumerated five civilizations sensu stricto and explored the relationship between the biological traits and the cultures of these five civilizations. In

  'fun' AI. Good AI competes to beat the player and win, whereas fun AI does not necessarily try to win a game but tries to give the human an enjoyable gameplay experience. A game like Civilization IV would have an AI that has features from both, their balance dependent on the difficulty setting. According to Johnson, building a successful AI for gameplay is not based on any novel technique, but requires a lot of hard work and coding. Johnson also had a considerable role in the development of the main theme music: Baba-Yetu, by working with his old classmate and composer, Christopher Tin. Christopher and Johnson, wanted to capture the essence of the

Daniel Tack from Game Informer gave the game 9/10, praising the new affinity system which influence players take on how to approach the alien life and the future of humanity on the new planet. He also praised the interesting sound effects, comprehensive advice guide and high replay value.

He criticized the unbalanced and non-challenging gameplay, as well as the pared-back culture system, which results in excessive focus on military conquest. Alex Navarro from Giant Bomb gave the game 3/5, criticizing its meaningless and inconsequential choices, which he stated did not really have any significant impact in winning a game. He also criticized the passive AI, gameplay mechanics that rarely work, lack of personality, lack of improvement over the game's predecessor, and too great a similarity to Civilization V in both user interface, pacing, and visual design.

He also praised the interesting sound effects, comprehensive advice guide and high replay value. Darren Nakamura from Destructoid also gave the game 9/10, praising the rewarding gameplay, colorful visuals, various new and influential features such as the orbital layer, the Virtues and the Affinity system, substantial overhaul in the technology system and appropriately grandiose soundtrack. He also stated

He felt the Affinity system was extraneous, however, and the new layout of the tech tree did not make scientific research markedly different from previous Civilization games. David Roberts from GamesRadar gave the game 8/10, praising the familiar Civilization gameplay, rewarding quests, and affinities, which change how players approach the new world's alien resources, but criticizing the game for being too similar to its predecessors, as well as the late game for being less interesting than opening turns.
