Though the Glen bears a passing resemblance to Scotland's Dandie Dinmont terrier, and even comes in two colors similar to the Dandie's \"mustard\" and \"pepper,\" it does not seem to be particularly closely related to that breed. DNA analysis indicates that the Glen of Imaal Terrier is more closely related to the mastiff-type dogs than it is to the terriers. The researchers noted that the Glen of Imaal Terrier was one of the breeds where genetic assignments conflict with phenotypic/functional designations. In a very few breeds, such as the American Staffordshire Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Brittany Spaniel, and Gordon Setter, symptoms do not appear until adulthood or even middle age. In dogs, cerebellar abiotrophy is also usually an autosomal recessive gene, but in a few breeds, such as the English Pointer, the gene is sex-linked.

Though the Glen bears a passing resemblance to Scotland's Dandie Dinmont terrier, and even comes in two colors similar to the Dandie's \"mustard\" and \"pepper,\" it does not seem to be particularly closely related to that breed. DNA analysis indicates that the Glen of Imaal Terrier is more closely related to the mastiff-type dogs than it is to the terriers. The researchers noted that the Glen of Imaal Terrier was one of the breeds where genetic assignments conflict with phenotypic/functional designations. In a very few breeds, such as the American Staffordshire Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Brittany Spaniel, and Gordon Setter, symptoms do not appear until adulthood or even middle age. In dogs, cerebellar abiotrophy is also usually an autosomal recessive gene, but in a few breeds, such as the English Pointer, the gene is sex-linked.

Bill Cosby 77 is an unreleased 2014 stand-up comedy film featuring Bill Cosby, filmed before a live audience at the San Francisco Jazz Center in California. Cosby chose the venue in honor of his friend Enrico Banducci and his establishment the hungry i. The comedian said his wife Camille Cosby helped with the editing process of the film. Around sixty minutes in duration, the film features Cosby pontificating on matters of children, romance, and matrimony. Cosby chose Netflix to release the performance because it would be able to be seen by viewers without interruptions for advertisements. The property currently has one hotel tower, a 140000 sqft casino, large poker room, a 4 acre lagoon-style pool facility with a center bar and many private restaurants, shops, spa, cabanas, bars and nightclubs, and the Hard Rock Event Center. Two of his songs, Happy-go-lively and Rue de la park can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album For Adults Only, which was recorded at a casino at midnight. band's song \"Smoke on the Water\" tells of the events of December 1971, when a Frank Zappa fan with a flare gun set the Montreux Casino on fire, destroying the casino where they had originally planned to record the album. Thanks to Claude Nobs who eventually arranged alternate locations, the Grand Hotel was where the album was created and recorded, except for Smoke on the Water which was recorded at La Petit Palais on Rue du Lac.\n\n"

King ) have introduced the Incorporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act, a proposed bill which would: \"...ensure that persons who form corporations or limited liability companies in the United States disclose the beneficial owners of those corporations or limited liability companies, in order to prevent wrongdoers from exploiting United States corporations and limited liability companies for criminal gain, to assist law enforcement in detecting, preventing, and punishing terrorism, money laundering, and other misconduct involving United States corporations and limited liability companies, and for other purposes.\" In recent years, a number of commentators have called for legislative reforms to the state secrets privilege. These reforms center around several ideas:  On January 22, 2008, Senators Edward Kennedy and Arlen Specter introduced, the State Secrets Protection Act. Commonly, politicians and high-ranking government officials are required to disclose financial information—assets such as stock, debts such as loans, and/or corporate positions held, typically annually. Certain professionals are required either by rules related to their professional organization, or by statute, to disclose any actual or potential conflicts of interest. An article in the New York Times in August 2007, on a lawsuit involving Society \n\n or another from Republican leadership, and said it was important for the Republican leadership team to hold \"broad appeal.\" Moore failed to disclose stock trades on time as required by the STOCK Act. Moore has acknowledged paying a \"late filing fee\" to the House Committee on Ethics in July 2021; the value of that fee generally starts at $200. Moore voted against the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. In the wake of the Taliban's conquering of Afghanistan, Moore introduced the Afghanistan Accountability Act to investigate what the Biden administration knew before deciding to leave Afghanistan. As of November 2021, Moore voted with Joe Biden's preferred positions 16% of the time, according to FiveThirtyEight's tracker.\n\n"

Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, developed into the leader of the group as early as 1808. Together, they worked to unite the various tribes against the European settlers coming across the Appalachian Mountains and onto their land. In November 1811, an American military force under the leadership of William Henry Harrison engaged warriors associated with Tenskwatawa in the Battle of Tippecanoe. In 1810, the Shawnee tribal chief Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against Tecumseh's Confederacy; the US gained victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. Succeeding Little Turkey as Principal Chief were Black Fox (1801–1811) and Pathkiller (1811–1827), both former warriors of Dragging Canoe.

        "context": " Tecumseh's confederacy was a confederation of native Americans in the Great Lakes region of the United States that began to form in the early 19th century around the teaching of Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). Shawnee leader Tecumseh, the brother of The Prophet, developed into the leader of the group as early as 1808. Together, they worked to unite the various tribes against the European settlers coming across the Appalachian Mountains and onto their land. In November 1811, an American military force under the leadership of William Henry Harrison engaged warriors associated with Tenskwatawa in the Battle of Tippecanoe. In 1810, the Shawnee tribal chief Tecumseh and his brother Tenskwatawa encouraged other indigenous tribes in the territory to resist European settlement. Tensions rose and the US authorized Harrison to launch a preemptive expedition against Tecumseh's Confederacy; the US gained victory at the Battle of Tippecanoe on November 7, 1811. Succeeding Little Turkey as Principal Chief were Black Fox (1801–1811) and Pathkiller (1811–1827), both former warriors of Dragging Canoe.

Some French-speaking ethnic groups such as the Acadians, the Brayons and the Métis may be included among the French Canadian group in linguistic contexts, but they are considered separate ethnic and cultural groups from French Canadians due to their distinct histories. During the 17th century, French settlers originating from the north of France settled Canada. It is from them that the French Canadian ethnicity was born. Then, during the 17th to 18th centuries, French Canadians expanded across North America and colonized various regions, cities, and towns.

The Fenian raids (1866–1871) were carried out by groups of Irish Americans, mostly Union Army veterans from the American Civil War who believed that by seizing Canada, concessions could be wrung from the British government regarding their policy in Ireland. The Fenians had also incorrectly assumed that Irish Canadians, who were quite numerous in Canada, would support their invasive efforts both politically and militarily. The first major influx of Irish came in 1844 from rural areas, spurred by the Irish Famine. After European arrival, fighting between indigenous groups tended to be bloodier and more decisive, especially as tribes became caught up in the economic and military rivalries of the European settlers.

The series is a \"manhunt\", following efforts of private detectives hired by the filmmakers, including bounty hunter Carla Campbell, to find a man from Lenexa, Kansas named Richard Scott Smith. After one former partner went to the police in 2017, he pleaded guilty to identity theft and received a 10 month jail sentence, later violating probation. The women each tell their stories of how they met Smith and came to be duped, and the film explores what led Smith to act in these ways. Revealed shortly into the movie, Andrew Morenski and two others, all stockbrokers, have managed to pass bogus bonds for a mobster awaiting trial. While running from the hitmen, he manages to board a train \n\n surveillance video shows that another patron - not a restaurant employee - threw a container of food from a take-out order at the male guest and his party.

Adequately powered prospective studies are needed to determine the effect on testosterone replacement on cardiovascular risk. Androgen Abuse by Athletes and Recreational Bodybuilders The illicit use of androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS) to enhance athletic performance first surfaced in the 1950s among power lifters and spread rapidly to other sports, professional as well as high school athletes, and recreational bodybuilders. In the early 1980s, the use of AAS spread beyond the athletic community into the general population, and now as many as 3 million Americans, most of them men, have likely used these compounds. Most AAS users are not athletes, but rather recreational weightlifters, who use these drugs to look lean and more muscular. The most commonly used AAS include testosterone esters, nandrolone, stanozolol, methandienone, and methenolol. AAS users generally use increasing doses of multiple steroids in a practice known as stacking. The adverse effects of long-term AAS abuse remain poorly understood. Most of the information about the adverse effects of AAS has emerged from case reports, uncontrolled studies, or clinical trials that used replacement doses of testosterone. The adverse event data from clinical trials using physiologic replacement doses of testosterone have been extrapolated unjustifiably to AAS users who may administer 10–100 times the replacement doses of testosterone over many years and to support the claim that AAS use is safe.The men who abuse androgenic steroids are more likely to engage in other high-risk behaviors than nonusers.The adverse events associated with AAS use may be due to AAS themselves, concomitant use of other drugs, high-risk behaviors, and host characteristics that may render these individuals more susceptible to AAS use or to other high-risk behaviors. AAS were designated a \"controlled substance\" by the United States Congress in 1990, with the Anabolic Steroid Control Act. Their use is seen as an issue in modern sport, particularly given the lengths to which athletes and professional laboratories go to in trying to conceal such use from sports regulators. Some female athletes may have naturally higher levels of testosterone than others, and may be asked to consent to sex verification and either surgery or drugs to decrease testosterone levels. This has proven contentious, with the Court of Arbitration for Sport suspending the IAAF policy due to insufficient evidence of a link between high androgen levels and improved athletic performance. Trenbolone acetate, sold under brand names such as Finajet and Finaplix among others, is an androgen and anabolic steroid (AAS) medication which is used in veterinary medicine, specifically to increase the profitability of livestock by promoting muscle growth in cattle. The drug is a synthetic androgen and anabolic steroid and hence is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the biological target of androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It has strong anabolic effects and highly androgenic effects, as well as potent progestogenic effects, and weak glucocorticoid effects. In addition to its veterinary use, trenbolone acetate is used to improve physique and performance, and is purchased from black market suppliers. Non-medical uses\n\nBodybuilding\nTrenbolone acetate was never approved for use in humans and therefore guidelines for human consumption do not exist. However, athletes and bodybuilders have been using trenbolone acetate as a physique- and performance-enhancing drug for decades. There are a large number of benefits as a bodybuilder through using trenbolone acetate as an AAS. Unlike testosterone, trenbolone acetate does not cause any fluid retention while gaining muscle mass. This allows bodybuilders to appear leaner, and this is why it is more commonly used whilst preparing for competitive events. Trenbolone enanthate is also a very commonly used AAS and lasts much longer than trenbolone acetate with intramuscular injection. However, as an AAS, it would be expected to be effective for indications in which other AAS are useful such as the treatment of conditions like androgen deficiency, wasting syndromes and muscle atrophy, and certain types of anemia. The strong androgenic nature of trenbolone acetate facilitates its tendency to produce virilization and this is why it is not recommended for women for physique- or performance-enhancing purposes. The side effects of trenbolone acetate are similar to other AAS; however, the negative side effects that are specifically facilitated by trenbolone acetate are as follows. Specific to the androgenic properties of trenbolone, common side effects of the AAS use include oily skin, acne, seborrhea, increased facial/body hair growth, and accelerated scalp hair loss. Hypogonadism\nTrenbolone acetate contributes greatly to muscle mass and feed efficiency; however, administration of the AAS suppresses natural testosterone production; i.e., it has the potential to cause  hypogonadism. This is a common effect of all AAS; the only difference is the variation in how much they suppress in comparison to others. Cardiovascular\nAdministration of any AAS can lead to cardiovascular issues. When compared to oral AAS, trenbolone acetate has a stronger negative effect on cholesterol levels. This negative effect is much more severe with the use of injectable AAS, particularly trenbolone acetate. Excess fluid retention is not possible with the administration of this AAS as a result of its not being estrogenic as opposed to testosterone. Like other AAS, trenbolone is an agonist of the androgen receptor (AR) and hence has anabolic and androgenic activity as well as antigonadotropic activity. Similar to many other AAS, trenbolone acetate has the capability to produce insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Extreme muscle growth and cell splitting compared is facilitated through trenbolone acetate administration when compared to other AAS. This allows for enhanced muscular endurance and therefore promotes a faster rate of recovery. The non-aromatizing nature of trenbolone acetate makes it a very appealing fat-burning agent. Its capability as a body-sculpting AAS is extreme. Many fitness models and bodybuilders use trenbolone acetate, particularly when preparing to compete in an upcoming bodybuilding competition. Chemistry\n\nTrenbolone acetate, or trenbolone 17β-acetate, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of nandrolone (19-nortestosterone). This facilitates the slow release of the AAS from the area of injection. Despite trenbolone acetate's official classification as a veterinary AAS, it is considered to be one of the most effective AAS used for physique- and performance-enhancing purposes in humans, particularly in bodybuilding. Trenbolone acetate became popular among bodybuilders and athletes during the early 1980s. Using AAS for any other purpose, or without a doctor's prescription, is illegal in most countries. Major sporting and bodybuilding organizations ban the use of controlled AAS, and the possession or sale of drugs can lead to arrest and conviction of drug-trafficking in many countries, including the United States and Australia.

Donald and Goofy have been hired to display posters, or bills, for a no name soup company. Goofy attempts, unsuccessfully, to paste his bills onto a nearby windmill, while Donald battles with a local farmyard goat, who's intent on eating everything it can. The battle ensues into a chase between Donald and the goat, ultimately concluding with the goat headbutting Donald and Goofy perpetually around the windmill blades.

It aims to perpetuate and spread the traditional religion of the ancient Guanche people. The Church of the Guanche People is included in the studies of minority religions in the Canary Islands. It was founded by a group of Canarian devotees of the goddess Chaxiraxi. The Church of the Guanche People performed baptisms and weddings according to what they know of Guanche custom. On 2002, a wedding held in accordance with purported Guanche rites took place on the island of Tenerife—a practice not observed for several centuries since the Spanish domination of the archipelago. The Church of the Guanche People has its own liturgical calendar, which officially begins with the first celebration of Achu n Magek in 2001. According to this system, this is the year I of the Guanche New Age. The Church of the Guanche People is a modern pagan religious body representing Canarian Neopaganism. These people may have also been the Guanches due to the analogous nature of the structures found. The first reliable account of the Guanche language was provided by the Genoese explorer Nicoloso da Recco in 1341, with a translation of numbers used by the islanders. It contains life-sized scenes of Guanche culture, and recreations of paintings and petroglyphs from various parts of the islands.\n\nQuestion: The Church of the Guanche People was founded in the city that is on the most populated island of what larger area?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It aims to perpetuate and spread the traditional religion of the ancient Guanche people. The Church of the Guanche People is included in the studies of minority religions in the Canary Islands. It was founded by a group of Canarian devotees of the goddess Chaxiraxi. The Church of the Guanche People performed baptisms and weddings according to what they know of Guanche custom. On 2002, a wedding held in accordance with purported Guanche rites took place on the island of Tenerife—a practice not observed for several centuries since the Spanish domination of the archipelago. The Church of the Guanche People has its own liturgical calendar, which officially begins with the first celebration of Achu n Magek in 2001. According to this system, this is the year I of the Guanche New Age. The Church of the Guanche People is a modern pagan religious body representing Canarian Neopaganism. These people may have also been the Guanches due to the analogous nature of the structures found. The first reliable account of the Guanche language was provided by the Genoese explorer Nicoloso da Recco in 1341, with a translation of numbers used by the islanders. It contains life-sized scenes of Guanche culture, and recreations of paintings and petroglyphs from various parts of the islands.\n\n"

Rice Krispies (known as Rice Bubbles in Australia and New Zealand) is a breakfast cereal, marketed by Kellogg's in 1927 and released to the public in 1928. Rice Krispies cereal has a long advertising history, with the elf cartoon characters Snap, Crackle and Pop touting the brand. In 1963, The Rolling Stones recorded a short song for a Rice Krispies television advertisement. Background\nRice Krispies are made by the Kellogg Company. Ingredients\nRice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin hydrochloride (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin) and vitamin D.\n\nAccording to Kellogg's, the rice used in the US version of the cereal is grown in the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved children's attentiveness by nearly 20%. Variants\n\nPresent day\nThe names of other products within the Rice Krispies family vary depending on where they are sold:\n Cocoa Krispies (called Coco Pops in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Greece and Italy), a chocolate flavored version (sold worldwide)\n Rice Krispies with Vanilla Flavor, sold in Canada and South Africa\n Chocolate and Vanilla Rice Krispies, a cereal containing mixed flavor Rce Krispies (introduced in 2007)\n Rice Krispies Treats Cereal, contains bunches of krispies fused together by a marshmallow coating (introduced in March 1993)\n Strawberry Pops, sold in South Africa\n Kellogg's Strawberry Krispies\nMany generic versions of Rice Krispies (including frosted and chocolate variants) have been produced by other manufacturers under many different names. Discontinued\n Frosted Rice Krispies (called Ricicles in the UK and Ireland)\n Rice Krispies with dehydrated miniature marshmallows (Marshmallow Rice Krispies, also known as Marshmallow Krispies, along with a tropical version, Fruity Marshmallow Krispies), were sold briefly in the United States and Canada. Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies, an extremely sweet, artificially-colored cereal, was sold from late 1997 to 1999. In the late 1990s, Kellogg's sold Halloween versions of their regular cereal. This included Halloween Rice Krispies which featured a variety of orange krispies. Rice Krispies Treats and similar sweets\nIn 1939, Kellogg's employee Mildred Day concocted and published a recipe for a Camp Fire Girls bake sale consisting of Rice Krispies, melted marshmallows, and margarine. It has remained a very popular snack dubbed Rice Krispies Treats. Kellogg's themselves have now produced commercial varieties of both marshmallow and chocolate-based treats under the name Rice Krispies Squares in Canada and the UK, as well as versions under the original Rice Krispies Treats name sold in the United States. Kellogg's also produces commercial versions of Rice Krispie treats known as Rice Krispies Squares, cereal bars, and a multi-grain cereal known as Rice Krispies Multi-Grain (formerly Muddles) sold on the UK market. Primarily aimed at children, Multi-Grain contains a prebiotic and is claimed by Kellogg's to promote good digestive health. In Australia, Rice Bubbles are found in a well-known homemade sweet, the chocolate crackle. This is often found at fetes and consists of Rice Bubbles, copha and cocoa, amongst other things. In the UK, a similar treat is made of Rice Krispies and melted chocolate. South African controversy \nIn 2018 the South African branch of Kellogg's replaced the classic Rice Krispies with Rice Krispies Vanilla, thereby discontinuing the production of the original Rice Krispies in the country. Kellogg's South Africa posted the following on their Facebook page in response to the outrage of South African consumers: \"Rice Krispies Vanilla is a new product that was launched in South Africa in June this year, responding to many of our customers’ calls for more innovation and variety. With Rice Krispies Vanilla we have moved from a single grain to a multi-grain formula which has additional nutritional benefits and allows us to source locally, promoting local farmers and jobs. While we fully understand that in some instances people prefer the original plain Rice Krispies, several different recipes were tested in market, and the vanilla formulation was significantly preferred by our local consumers. Despite the public's obvious and vocal disgust with the product, Kellogg's decided to stay firm in their decision on replacing the original Rice Krispies with the new Rice Krispies Vanilla, until 2020 when Kellogg's returned the original product to shelves. Zandi Mposelwa, head of external relations at Kellogg Sub Saharan Africa, released the following statement: \"We have decided to relaunch [the original Rice Krispies] in the market, whilst keeping the Rice Krispies Vanilla variant to ensure that we meet different consumer needs for variety.

In 1963, The Rolling Stones recorded a short song for a Rice Krispies television advertisement. Background\nRice Krispies are made by the Kellogg Company. Ingredients\nRice Krispies contain rice, sugar, salt, malt flavoring, iron, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha tocopherol acetate (vitamin E), niacinamide, vitamin A palmitate, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), thiamin hydrochloride (vitamin B1), folic acid, vitamin B12 (as cyanocobalamin) and vitamin D.\n\nAccording to Kellogg's, the rice used in the US version of the cereal is grown in the states of Louisiana and Arkansas. The FTC had previously found fault with Kellogg's claims that Frosted Mini-Wheats cereal improved children's attentiveness by nearly 20%. Variants\n\nPresent day\nThe names of other products within the Rice Krispies family vary depending on where they are sold:\n Cocoa Krispies (called Coco Pops in the UK, Ireland, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Greece and Italy), a chocolate flavored version (sold worldwide)\n Rice Krispies with Vanilla Flavor, sold in Canada and South Africa\n Chocolate and Vanilla Rice Krispies, a cereal containing mixed flavor Rce Krispies (introduced in 2007)\n Rice Krispies Treats Cereal, contains bunches of krispies fused together by a marshmallow coating (introduced in March 1993)\n Strawberry Pops, sold in South Africa\n Kellogg's Strawberry Krispies\nMany generic versions of Rice Krispies (including frosted and chocolate variants) have been produced by other manufacturers under many different names. Discontinued\n Frosted Rice Krispies (called Ricicles in the UK and Ireland)\n Rice Krispies with dehydrated miniature marshmallows (Marshmallow Rice Krispies, also known as Marshmallow Krispies, along with a tropical version, Fruity Marshmallow Krispies), were sold briefly in the United States and Canada. Razzle Dazzle Rice Krispies, an extremely sweet, artificially-colored cereal, was sold from late 1997 to 1999. In the late 1990s, Kellogg's sold Halloween versions of their regular cereal. This included Halloween Rice Krispies which featured a variety of orange krispies. Rice Krispies Treats and similar sweets\nIn 1939, Kellogg's employee Mildred Day concocted and published a recipe for a Camp Fire Girls bake sale consisting of Rice Krispies, melted marshmallows, and margarine. It has remained a very popular snack dubbed Rice Krispies Treats. Kellogg's themselves have now produced commercial varieties of both marshmallow and chocolate-based treats under the name Rice Krispies Squares in Canada and the UK, as well as versions under the original Rice Krispies Treats name sold in the United States. Kellogg's also produces commercial versions of Rice Krispie treats known as Rice Krispies Squares, cereal bars, and a multi-grain cereal known as Rice Krispies Multi-Grain (formerly Muddles) sold on the UK market. Primarily aimed at children, Multi-Grain contains a prebiotic and is claimed by Kellogg's to promote good digestive health. In Australia, Rice Bubbles are found in a well-known homemade sweet, the chocolate crackle. This is often found at fetes and consists of Rice Bubbles, copha and cocoa, amongst other things. In the UK, a similar treat is made of Rice Krispies and melted chocolate. South African controversy \nIn 2018 the South African branch of Kellogg's replaced the classic Rice Krispies with Rice Krispies Vanilla, thereby discontinuing the production of the original Rice Krispies in the country. Kellogg's South Africa posted the following on their Facebook page in response to the outrage of South African consumers: \"Rice Krispies Vanilla is a new product that was launched in South Africa in June this year, responding to many of our customers’ calls for more innovation and variety. With Rice Krispies Vanilla we have moved from a single grain to a multi-grain formula which has additional nutritional benefits and allows us to source locally, promoting local farmers and jobs. While we fully understand that in some instances people prefer the original plain Rice Krispies, several different recipes were tested in market, and the vanilla formulation was significantly preferred by our local consumers. Despite the public's obvious and vocal disgust with the product, Kellogg's decided to stay firm in their decision on replacing the original Rice Krispies with the new Rice Krispies Vanilla, until 2020 when Kellogg's returned the original product to shelves.

Originally opened in 1969 with a Spitz Space Transit Planetarium, the Planetarium upgraded to an Evans & Sutherland Digistar 1 vector display in 1988, and was the first in the U.S. and third in the world to adopt multiple-projector digital image capability using the Sky-Skan SkyVision system in 1998. That allowed it to show fulldome movies, many of which were created by HMNS staff. Since 2004 its outreach program, \"Discovery Dome\", takes the planetarium experience on the road, reaching over 40,000 students per year in classrooms and special events in portable digital domes. The Metrodome itself cost $68 million to build—significantly under budget—totaling around $124 million with infrastructure and other costs associated with the project added. It was a somewhat utilitarian facility, though not quite as spartan as Metropolitan Stadium.

Boynton Beach Mall is an enclosed shopping mall in Boynton Beach, Florida, owned by Washington Prime Group, who assumed ownership of the mall and 97 others after its spinoff from Simon Property Group in 2014. It was built by the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation like Coral Square for which it is similar in layout. The mall had serious material condition issues in April 2014 that Worthington, Minnesota took action on. The mall was sold to 7&41 LLC in May 2015. The mall was later sold to ViaPort USA for $9.25 million.\n\n"

In the initial phase of Masters and Johnson's studies, from 1957 until 1965, they recorded some of the first laboratory data on the anatomy and physiology of human sexual response based on direct observation of 382 women and 312 men in what they conservatively estimated to be \"10,000 complete \n\nJohnson, Timothy (2003).

Even after killing him, Shahu and Bajirao avoided a rivalry with the powerful Dabhade clan: Trimbak's brother Yashwant Rao was made the new senapati of Shahu. were beyond the control of the Raja, and when Shivaji and his son Sambhaji went to Agra to meet Aurangzeb, they were placed under house arrest because of Shivaji's apparent misbehaviour, from which they managed to effect a daring escape. While Aurangzeb continued to send troops against him, Shivaji expanded Maratha control throughout the Deccan until his death in 1680. In 1708, with mediation by his assistant Balaji Vishwanath, who would later become Peshwa in 1713, Dhanaji left Tarabai and joined hands with Shahu at Khed. After the death of Shivaji, Shahu Shivaji, heir apparent to the Maratha Empire, captured by Mughals when he was only seven years old, remained their prisoner till the death of his father in 1700. The Dowager Maharani Tarabai proclaimed his younger half-brother, and her son, Shahu Sambhaji as Chhatrapati Maharaj under her regency. Mughals released Shahu under certain preconditions in 1707, so that Marathas would face an internal war for the throne. Aurangzeb's son Muhammad Azam Shah conquered Satara fort Ajinkyatara after a 6-month siege, later won by Parshuram Pratinidhi in 1706. In 1708 Chattrapati Shahu, the son of Chattrapati Sambhaji, was crowned at the Satara fort. Chattrapati Udayanraje Bhonsle is the 13th descendant of Shivaji.\n\n"

He was the son of Jahsh ibn Riyab and Umama bint Abdulmuttalib, hence a brother of Abd-Allah ibn Jahsh, Zaynab bint Jahsh, Abu Ahmad ibn Jahsh, Habiba bint Jahsh and Hammanah bint Jahsh, a first cousin of Islamic prophet Muhammad and Ali, and a nephew of Hamza ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib. He married Ramla bint Abi Sufyan (who was also known as Umm Habiba), and they had one daughter, Habibah bint Ubayd-Allah. For the history of al-Arabi, we must rely on the Muslim historian Abu al-Hassan Ali ibn Muhammad ibn Muhammad (1160-1233), also known as Ali ‘izz ad-Din ibn al-Athir al-Jazari (ibn al-Athir), who wrote four centuries after the fact. He was born c. 994 CE/384 AH in the small town of Khosrowjerd near Sabzevar, then known as Bayhaq, in Khurasan.\n\n"

As the Shell people are attacked by a giant turtle, the women call it Archelon which is the real scientific name for the animal. The film uses four live creatures: a green iguana, a warthog, a Loaghtan and a tarantula (a cricket can be seen at the tarantula's side). Ray Harryhausen was asked repeatedly about these unanimated creatures, and he confessed they were his idea.

Ireland has seen a significant decline from the 84.2% who identified as Catholic in the 2011 census. 65% of Irish Catholics support same-sex marriage and 30% oppose it. Ireland (Éire ; Ulster-Scots: Airlann ) is an island in the North Atlantic. In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. Besides, Galway and Dublin, the Community has members in Cork, Limerick, and a number of smaller towns and cities across Ireland. About 30% of Ulster Protestants live in the three counties of Ulster now in the Republic of Ireland, Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal, where they make up around a fifth of the Republic's Protestant population. Unlike Protestants in the rest of the Republic, some retain a sense of Britishness, and a small number have difficulty identifying with the independent Irish state.

Ireland (Éire ; Ulster-Scots: Airlann ) is an island in the North Atlantic. In 2011, the population of Ireland was about 6.6 million, ranking it the second-most populous island in Europe after Great Britain. Besides, Galway and Dublin, the Community has members in Cork, Limerick, and a number of smaller towns and cities across Ireland. About 30% of Ulster Protestants live in the three counties of Ulster now in the Republic of Ireland, Cavan, Monaghan, and Donegal, where they make up around a fifth of the Republic's Protestant population.

Aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, plays a key role in the regulation of ENaC activity. Specific cleavage sites on ENaC can be targeted by urinary proteases, leading to its activation and subsequent sodium retention in conditions like nephrotic syndrome. This mechanism may be relevant in inflammatory renal diseases. This suggests that endogenous substances like bile acids might influence ENaC activity through specific interactions with the channel. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex regulation of ENaC in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron. In one study, transgenic mice over expressing this membrane protein were shown to have increased reabsorption and retention of sodium after increased salt intake. which exerts its effect in the medullary collecting duct for water reabsorption. The net result of these 4 mechanisms of salt and water retention is decreased output and decreased urinary excretion of sodium (< 20 mEq/L). The increased reabsorption of Na leads to increased water and urea reabsorption from the proximal tubules of the kidney back into the blood. In contrast, creatinine is actually secreted in the proximal tubule. The amount of sodium present in the body affects the extracellular volume, which in turn influences blood pressure. Cortisol is the main glucocorticoid in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. Shock stimulates the hypothalamus to release corticotropin-releasing hormone, which results in the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary. Cortisol acts synergistically with epinephrine and glucagon to induce a catabolic state. Cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance, resulting in hyperglycemia as well as muscle cell protein breakdown and lipolysis to provide sub-strates for hepatic gluconeogenesis. Cortisol causes retention of sodium and water by the nephrons of the kidney. In the setting of severe hypovolemia, ACTH secretion occurs independently of cortisol negative feedback inhibition.The renin-angiotensin system is activated in shock.
