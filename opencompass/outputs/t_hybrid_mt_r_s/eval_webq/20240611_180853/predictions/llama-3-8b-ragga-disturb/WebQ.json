If someone wishes to deceive himself or to deceive others by believing that Islam can be brought in line with this Jahiliyyah, it is up to him. Today the task of the Call is to return these ignorant people to Islam and make them into Muslims all over again.'\" According to Rashid Shaz the whole Muslim world is permeated with pre-Islamic superstitions, which he relates to \"clinging to false hope\" and even shirk. According to Travis Zadeh, while various elite Islamic religious factions in various geographical and historical context did contest and probed into  beliefs and practices that were assumed to be superstitious, still, Quranic charms, belief in jinn, and visiting tombs of prophets and \n\n dominant belief system in pre-Islamic Arabia. The religious beliefs and practices of the nomadic bedouin were distinct from those of the settled tribes of towns such as Mecca. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edward Peters, \"The Qur’ān insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews .\n\n"

In his time with the Colts, Manning led them to two Super Bowls, winning one. On March 20, 2012, after 14 years with the Colts, Manning signed with the Denver Broncos, for whom he played until his retirement following the season. Like Brady, Manning led his new team to their first Super Bowl win in nearly two decades. Brady led the series in Foxborough 8–2, while Manning led the series in Indianapolis/Denver 4–3. The two quarterbacks met five times in the NFL Playoffs, in which Manning won three of them (all five were won by the home team, as Brady's two wins both came in Foxborough). Four of the five match-ups were in the AFC Championship Game, with Manning winning three of the four, one of the games with the Colts (2006) and another two with the Broncos (2013, 2015). Four of the teams, Brady's 2003 and 2004 Patriots and Manning's 2006 Colts and 2015 Broncos went on to win the Super Bowl, while Manning's 2013 Broncos lost the game.

He was the state's first governor since the Civil War to win three consecutive terms and the first to die in office. Prior to his election as governor, he served two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1901–1905). He created Tennessee's first state park and assured the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During his tenure, the balance of power in state politics shifted from the state legislature to the governor. Two-term Governor Bill Haslam was term-limited, as Tennessee does not allow governors to serve three consecutive terms. He tightened the state's budgets, called for additional funds for Tennessee's Rainy day fund, and worked on making Tennessee more business-friendly. This was done to make Tennessee more attractive to businesses and improve the workforce.

The current governor is Bill Lee, a member of the Republican Party, who took office on January 19, 2019. He was the state's first governor since the Civil War to win three consecutive terms and the first to die in office. Prior to his election as governor, he served two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1901–1905). He created Tennessee's first state park and assured the establishment of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. During his tenure, the balance of power in state politics shifted from the state legislature to the governor. Two-term Governor Bill Haslam was term-limited, as Tennessee does not allow governors to serve three consecutive terms. He tightened the state's budgets, called for additional funds for Tennessee's Rainy day fund, and worked on making Tennessee more business-friendly. This was done to make Tennessee more attractive to businesses and improve the workforce. Bill Lee, Republican, is the 50th governor of Tennessee, succeeding Bill Haslam in 2019.\n\n"

Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop art  and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism. In Europe masters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement. Boitel belonged to the art movement called \"La Jeune Peinture\" (\"Young Picture\") of the School of Paris, with painters like Bernard Buffet, Yves Brayer, Jansem, Jean Carzou, Louis Vuillermoz, Pierre-Henry, Daniel du Janerand, Gaston Sébire, Paul Collomb, Jean Monneret, Jean Joyet and Gaëtan de Rosnay. Intimism was most notably practiced by French painters Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard after the 1899 disbandment of Les Nabis. Edgar Degas and Felix Vallotton have also been characterized as intimists. French art critic Camille Mauclair defined Intimism as: \"a revelation of the soul through the things painted, the magnetic suggestion of what lies behind them through the description of the outer appearance, the intimate meaning of the spectacles of life\" While the movement is often associated with Impressionism, the Intimists diverged from the Impressionists in abandoning a focus on formal accuracy in depiction of light, color, and perspective in favor of emphasized texture, exaggerated palette, and merged figure and ground. important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse.

Modernist artists like Marsden Hartley, Patrick Henry Bruce, Gerald Murphy and Stuart Davis created reputations abroad. While Patrick Henry Bruce created cubist related paintings in Europe, both Stuart Davis and Gerald Murphy made paintings that were early inspirations for American pop art  and Marsden Hartley experimented with expressionism. In Europe masters like Henri Matisse and Pierre Bonnard continued developing their narrative styles independent of any movement. Boitel belonged to the art movement called \"La Jeune Peinture\" (\"Young Picture\") of the School of Paris, with painters like Bernard Buffet, Yves Brayer, Jansem, Jean Carzou, Louis Vuillermoz, Pierre-Henry, Daniel du Janerand, Gaston Sébire, Paul Collomb, Jean Monneret, Jean Joyet and Gaëtan de Rosnay. Intimism was most notably practiced by French painters Édouard Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard after the 1899 disbandment of Les Nabis. Edgar Degas and Felix Vallotton have also been characterized as intimists. French art critic Camille Mauclair defined Intimism as: \"a revelation of the soul through the things painted, the magnetic suggestion of what lies behind them through the description of the outer appearance, the intimate meaning of the spectacles of life\" While the movement is often associated with Impressionism, the Intimists diverged from the Impressionists in abandoning a focus on formal accuracy in depiction of light, color, and perspective in favor of emphasized texture, exaggerated palette, and merged figure and ground. important artists, including the work of Henri Matisse. The Musée Matisse in Nice, a municipal museum, has one of the world's largest collections of Matisse's works, tracing his artistic beginnings and his evolution through to his last works.\n\n"

William Frederick Morris was Dean of Clogher from 1959 until 1962. Born in Smithfield, North Carolina, Morris received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1912. A 6 ft forward from the University of Maryland, College Park, Morris was hailed as one of the best prospects in all of college basketball after his sophomore season in 1998–99.

He had offers from several European universities, including Christ Church, Oxford where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in \n\n Bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. When Einstein offered to be a character witness for Du Bois, the judge decided to drop the case. In 1946 Einstein visited Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. Lincoln was the first university in the United States to grant college degrees to African Americans; alumni include Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall. Einstein gave a speech about racism in America, adding, \"I do not intend to be quiet about it.\" A resident of Princeton recalls that Einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student. Einstein has said \"Being a Jew myself, perhaps I can understand and empathize with how black people feel as victims of discrimination\". Dr. Paul E. Levin has several professional roles and responsibilities at Montefiore and Albert Einstein College of Medicine. In summary, Dr. Paul E. Levin holds significant roles at Montefiore and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, including Vice Chairman of the Department of Orthopedics and Director of the Department of Orthopedics, Moses Campus. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909. In July 1912, he returned to his alma mater in Zürich.\n\n"

Earhart devoted significant time to coordinating Amelia's posthumous affairs, setting up donations, marshalling information, and dealing with Amelia's fans. She corresponded with museums, aviation clubs, the U.S. Air Force, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Earhart also spoke out against the speculations that arose in the wake of Amelia's death. She denied, for example, that her sister died while on a spy mission, as some theorists have past suggested. Earhart wrote two books about Amelia, Courage is the Price and Amelia, My Courageous Sister. The last known 1935 Lockheed Electra L-10E — the type of plane Amelia flew in 1937 — is named after Muriel Earhart. Long is the originator and leading proponent of the book's \"Crash and Sink\" theory explaining Amelia Earhart's disappearance.

Earhart devoted significant time to coordinating Amelia's posthumous affairs, setting up donations, marshalling information, and dealing with Amelia's fans. She corresponded with museums, aviation clubs, the U.S. Air Force, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Earhart also spoke out against the speculations that arose in the wake of Amelia's death. She denied, for example, that her sister died while on a spy mission, as some theorists have past suggested. Earhart wrote two books about Amelia, Courage is the Price and Amelia, My Courageous Sister. The last known 1935 Lockheed Electra L-10E — the type of plane Amelia flew in 1937 — is named after Muriel Earhart.

The Afrikaans language arose in the Dutch Cape Colony, through a gradual divergence from European Dutch dialects, during the course of the 18th century. As early as the mid-18th century and as recently as the mid-20th century, Afrikaans was known in standard Dutch as a \"kitchen language\" (kombuistaal), lacking the prestige accorded, for example, even by the educational system in Africa, to languages spoken outside Africa.

While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried took some measures to encourage assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for either language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions. One thing that the schools did have in common was the Dutch Language.

Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman argue that Afrikaans' development as a separate language was \"heavily conditioned by nonwhites who learned Dutch imperfectly as a second language.\" For example, the Dutch word \"punaise\" (English: Drawing pin) is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word \"duimspijker\" (literally: thumb spike) as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch.\n\nQuestion: where did dutch language come from?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The Afrikaans language arose in the Dutch Cape Colony, through a gradual divergence from European Dutch dialects, during the course of the 18th century. As early as the mid-18th century and as recently as the mid-20th century, Afrikaans was known in standard Dutch as a \"kitchen language\" (kombuistaal), lacking the prestige accorded, for example, even by the educational system in Africa, to languages spoken outside Africa.

While in control of Belgium, France and the Netherlands each tried took some measures to encourage assimilation of their national languages, but in neither case did their rule last long enough for either language to become fully entrenched across the region or for local dialects to be displaced. There was a huge variation in accents, spelling and grammar across the country, particularly in Flanders, where regional dialects were almost incomprehensible to those from other regions.

Sarah Grey Thomason and Terrence Kaufman argue that Afrikaans' development as a separate language was \"heavily conditioned by nonwhites who learned Dutch imperfectly as a second language.\" For example, the Dutch word \"punaise\" (English: Drawing pin) is derived directly from the French language. Belgian Dutch language purists have lobbied to accept the word \"duimspijker\" (literally: thumb spike) as official Dutch, though the Dutch Language Union never accepted it as standard Dutch.\n\n"

Over the past 400 years, the forms of the language used in the Americas—especially in the United States—and that used in the United \n\n - native Celts which is what the new Anglo Saxon speaking peoples called the native inhabitants of England. There is strong evidence that in many areas of England taken over by Germanic speaking settlers, the native British (Wealas) remained undisturbed, farming the same land they did when the Romans left. British English occupies the position of high variety in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar while Andalusian Spanish occupies the position of low Variety, particularly as spoken in its local Llanito variety. Code-switching and Translanguaging are common place in Gibraltarian language practice. British Poles, alternatively known as Polish British people or Polish Britons, are ethnic Poles who are citizens of the United Kingdom. Since the late 20th century, they have become one of the largest ethnic minorities in the country alongside Indians, Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, Germans and the Irish. About 1% of the UK population speaks Polish.\n\n"

The transplant was a five-minute procedure in which the donor cells from Robin’s sister, Sally-Ann, were injected into Robin’s system through a syringe. “Nobody can believe it,” Dr. Gail Roboz, the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center oncologist who is treating Robin, said today on “GMA” of the short procedure. As she underwent the transplant Robin was surrounded by Sally-Ann and another sister, Dorothy, and other loved ones, including “World News” anchor Diane Sawyer and “GMA”‘s weather anchor, Sam Champion. Robin faced the procedure with grace, strength and humor. Doctors will treat Robin with intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement and anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal medications, Roboz said. Though she’ll be monitored daily, doctors won’t expect to see significant signs of recovery for about 10 days. In two weeks or so, Robin should begin to feel better. The primary goal of the transplant is to get Robin’s system to correctly produce white blood cells and platelets. Even though Robin’s sister was a perfect match, Robin’s system will still try to attack the donor cells. Doctors will work to prevent any symptoms of graft vs. host disease – a rejection of the bone marrow transplant. Robin’s time in the hospital will be determined by how well her body adapts to the transplant. Roboz has answered questions the “GMA” staff and fans had about Robin’s treatment, procedure and recovery process. The day a patient receives a bone marrow transplant is often called “Day Zero.” What are the benchmarks in Robin’s progress from there? [Until her donated cells engraft and] she starts making blood cells and platelets on her own, she’s completely dependent on platelet and blood transfusions. It’s about filling in for what your system can’t do. You can’t make cells or platelets, so you’ll have transfusions. What will her hospital set-up be like during this period? She’ll need fewer transfusions, fewer medications, she’ll be getting out of the hospital [after 30 days]. If all goes well, Robin will go home after 30 days. We have to watch patients super-closely for 100 days. By fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an oxygen tent, and her platelets were low enough that whenever she started bleeding it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop. Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. Prescott Bush, George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication, Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \"a hundred or so\" stomach ulcers. Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to \n\n in New York City. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent Sloan Kettering Institute. He told George and Barbara that \"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\" The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication. For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George \n\n back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers. Robin was, by her mother's account, \"wonderful\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked bone marrow tests, which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured. At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete remission. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well. Barbara and George heard about a doctor in Kansas City who maintained he had found the \n\n yet noticed the bruises on Robin. Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage leukemia. Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal. The Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the country club were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, John M.

        "context": "“Good Morning America” co-anchor Robin Roberts underwent a bone marrow transplant Thursday to treat MDS, a bone marrow disorder that affects blood cells production. The transplant was a five-minute procedure in which the donor cells from Robin’s sister, Sally-Ann, were injected into Robin’s system through a syringe. “Nobody can believe it,” Dr. Gail Roboz, the New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center oncologist who is treating Robin, said today on “GMA” of the short procedure. As she underwent the transplant Robin was surrounded by Sally-Ann and another sister, Dorothy, and other loved ones, including “World News” anchor Diane Sawyer and “GMA”‘s weather anchor, Sam Champion. Robin faced the procedure with grace, strength and humor. Doctors will treat Robin with intravenous fluids, electrolyte replacement and anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal medications, Roboz said. Though she’ll be monitored daily, doctors won’t expect to see significant signs of recovery for about 10 days. In two weeks or so, Robin should begin to feel better. The primary goal of the transplant is to get Robin’s system to correctly produce white blood cells and platelets. Even though Robin’s sister was a perfect match, Robin’s system will still try to attack the donor cells. Doctors will work to prevent any symptoms of graft vs. host disease – a rejection of the bone marrow transplant. Robin’s time in the hospital will be determined by how well her body adapts to the transplant. Roboz has answered questions the “GMA” staff and fans had about Robin’s treatment, procedure and recovery process. The day a patient receives a bone marrow transplant is often called “Day Zero.” What are the benchmarks in Robin’s progress from there? [Until her donated cells engraft and] she starts making blood cells and platelets on her own, she’s completely dependent on platelet and blood transfusions. It’s about filling in for what your system can’t do. You can’t make cells or platelets, so you’ll have transfusions. What will her hospital set-up be like during this period? She’ll need fewer transfusions, fewer medications, she’ll be getting out of the hospital [after 30 days]. If all goes well, Robin will go home after 30 days. We have to watch patients super-closely for 100 days. By fall, Robin's condition was worsening. She spent time in an oxygen tent, and her platelets were low enough that whenever she started bleeding it was very difficult to ascertain when it would stop. Barbara allowed no crying around Robin, and made her husband leave the room if he felt like doing so. Prescott Bush, George's father, had purchased a plot for Robin to be buried in, as her situation was not improving. Eventually, due to her medication, Robin developed heavy bruising, which almost entirely covered one of her legs, and \"a hundred or so\" stomach ulcers. Barbara called George, and, by the time he arrived to \n\n in New York City. Walker urged them to take Robin to the adjacent Sloan Kettering Institute. He told George and Barbara that \"you could never live with yourselves unless you treat her.\" The very next day, leaving George W. and Jeb with different friends, they both flew to New York and had Robin admitted into Sloan Kettering. She was tested once again, and, after the diagnosis was confirmed, she was immediately put on medication. For the next six months, Barbara largely remained in New York with Robin, while George \n\n back and forth, due to his job. Their two sons were cared for either by family friends or by housekeepers. Robin was, by her mother's account, \"wonderful\", not questioning why she was sick. She disliked bone marrow tests, which were very painful, as were many of the blood transfusions she endured. At times, the medication was so effective that Robin did not even appear to be ill. However, she never went into complete remission. According to Charlotte Tan, who treated Robin in New York, she was mature and tolerated her treatments well. Barbara and George heard about a doctor in Kansas City who maintained he had found the \n\n yet noticed the bruises on Robin. Dr. Wyvell told George and Barbara that Robin had advanced stage leukemia. Neither parent had ever heard of leukemia, and, in the 1950s, not much was known of it; consequently, it was nearly always fatal. The Bushes went against both parts of the doctor's advice. Almost immediately, their friends from the country club were discussing Robin's diagnosis, and George called his uncle, John M. Walker, president of MeMemorial\n\n"

Currency of some type has been used in China since the Neolithic age which can be traced back to between 3000 and 4500 years ago. Around 210 BC, the first emperor of China Qin Shi Huang (260–210 BC) abolished all other forms of local currency and introduced a uniform copper coin. Paper money was invented in China in the 9th century, but the base unit of currency remained the copper coin.

The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas. English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first immigration of non-English speakers from Western Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century. Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, primarily European languages. English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home.

        "context": " English is spoken worldwide, and the Standard Written English grammar generally taught in schools around the world will vary only slightly. The use of English in the United States is a result of British colonization of the Americas. English thus predominated in the colonies even by the end of the 17th century's first immigration of non-English speakers from Western Europe and Africa, and firsthand descriptions of a fairly uniform American English became common after the mid-18th century. Since then, American English has developed into some new varieties, including regional dialects that, in some cases, show minor influences in the last two centuries from successive waves of immigrant speakers of diverse languages, primarily European languages. English is the de facto national language. Although there is no official language at the federal level, some laws—such as U.S. naturalization requirements—standardize English. In 2007, about 226 million, or 80% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only English at home.

He completed his first chapters of the book while simultaneously working on his Tales of the Alhambra. It was not published. After returning to the United States from several years abroad, settled at his New York home Sunnyside, he rapidly completed The Life of Mahomet and Mahomet and His Successors, which were published in 1849 and 1850, respectively. Irving studied medicine at Columbia College, taking his degree in 1794. He was editor of the Democratic paper The Morning Herald, and the weekly Corrector, to which his friend William Alexander Duer contributed and which supported Aaron Burr in his contest with Morgan Lewis for New York Governor. Like his brothers William and John, Peter was a member of the Calliopean Society, a literary club for young men that sometimes met at William's house. Reportedly, \"'Peter was atypical of the partisan editors of the period. He was too reserved to print obvious lies, or to pass on ugly rumors and pitch abusive words at Burr's enemies.

He completed his first chapters of the book while simultaneously working on his Tales of the Alhambra. It was not published. After returning to the United States from several years abroad, settled at his New York home Sunnyside, he rapidly completed The Life of Mahomet and Mahomet and His Successors, which were published in 1849 and 1850, respectively. Irving studied medicine at Columbia College, taking his degree in 1794. He was editor of the Democratic paper The Morning Herald, and the weekly Corrector, to which his friend William Alexander Duer contributed and which supported Aaron Burr in his contest with Morgan Lewis for New York Governor. Like his brothers William and John, Peter was a member of the Calliopean Society, a literary club for young men that sometimes met at William's house. Reportedly, \"'Peter was atypical of the partisan editors of the period. He was too reserved to print obvious lies, or to pass on ugly rumors and pitch abusive words at Burr's enemies.

At the time, Germans used the phrase \"world war\" for any major conflict between the European powers. By invoking the \n\n egregious Versklavungs- und Vernichtungskrieg [war of enslavement and annihilation] known to modern history\" and distinguished it from a \"normal war\", as the Nazi regime conducted against France. Nevertheless, Speer believed that Germany should continue the war for as long as possible with the goal of winning better conditions from the \n\n inaction. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September, surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop, \"Now what?\" Not until 1943, under Albert Speer (the minister of armaments in the Reich), did Germany finally redirect its entire economy and manpower to war production.

Ringo Starr's version was released as a single in the United States on December 3, 1973, and in the UK on February 8, 1974. Although McCartney is credited on the liner notes of the album Ringo as having played the solo on a kazoo, reviewer Michael Verity has quoted the song's producer Richard Perry as revealing that it wasn't actually a kazoo: \"In fact, the solo on ‘You’re Sixteen,’ which sounds like a kazoo or something, was Paul singing very spontaneously as we played that track back, so he’s singing the solo on that.\"\n\n"
