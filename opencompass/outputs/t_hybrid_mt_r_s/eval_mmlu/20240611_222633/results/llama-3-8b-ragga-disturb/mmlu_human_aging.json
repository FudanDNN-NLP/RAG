The leading contributors to disease burden in older people are cardiovascular diseases (30·3%), malignant neoplasms (15·1%), chronic respiratory diseases (9·5%), musculoskeletal diseases (7·5%), and neurological and mental disorders (6·6%). Geriatrics and gerontology are related fields but have distinct focuses. The goal of geriatrics is to promote and maintain the health of older adults by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities that commonly affect them. It encompasses various disciplines such as biology, psychology, sociology, and economics to understand how individuals age physically, mentally, socially, and economically. Gerontologists conduct research on aging-related topics like longevity, age-related diseases, social aspects of aging, and quality of life for older adults. While both geriatrics and gerontology focus on issues related to aging, their approaches differ. Geriatrics primarily concentrates on clinical care for elderly patients while gerontology takes a broader perspective by examining the overall process of aging from multiple angles. It's worth noting that sometimes geriatrics is also referred to as medical gerontology. In summary, geriatrics involves providing medical care to older adults whereas gerontology involves studying the multifaceted aspects of aging itself. Both fields play crucial roles in addressing the healthcare needs and understanding the complexities associated with an aging population. Successful ageing may be viewed an interdisciplinary concept, spanning both psychology and sociology, where it is seen as the transaction between society and individuals across the life span with specific \n\nThe main areas of focus in geriatric psychiatry include the study, prevention, and treatment of neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment, and mental disorders in older adults. Geriatric psychiatry, also known as geropsychiatry or psychiatry of old age, is a subspecialty of psychiatry that has significant overlap with other specialties such as geriatric medicine, behavioral neurology, neuropsychiatry, neurology, and general psychiatry. They diagnose and treat mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, which may have distinct presentations and treatment considerations in this age group. - Diseases and disorders diagnosed or managed by geriatric psychiatrists include dementia, mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

The last type of test is considered to be a more reliable measure of senescence's effect on reproductive effort, as younger individuals should reduce reproductive effort to reduce their chance of death because of their high future reproductive prospects, while older animals should increase effort because of their low future prospects. The Reproductive-Cell Cycle Theory posits that the hormones that regulate reproduction act in an antagonistic pleiotrophic manner to control aging via cell cycle signaling; promoting growth and development early in life in order to achieve reproduction, but later in life, in a futile attempt to maintain reproduction, become dysregulated and drive senescence. Rather than seeing aging as a loss of functionality as we get older, this theory defines aging as any change in an organism over time, as evidenced by the fact that if all chemical reactions in the body were stopped, no change, and thus no aging, would occur. When the HPG axis becomes unbalanced, cellular growth and development is dysregulated, and cell death and dysfunction can occur, both of which can initiate senescence, the accumulated damage to cells, tissues, and organs that occurs with the passage of time and that is associated with functional loss during aging. Recent parabiosis studies prove many of the tenets of the Reproductive Cell-Cycle Theory of Aging. engaging in conventional forward oriented “so-that” reasoning.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

Aside from the evidence in favor of a positivity bias, though, there have still been many documented cases of older adults displaying a negativity bias. Positive self-perception of health has been correlated with higher well-being and reduced mortality in the elderly. Various reasons have been proposed for this association; people who are objectively healthy may naturally rate their health better than that of their ill counterparts, though this link has been observed even in studies which have controlled for socioeconomic status, psychological functioning and health status. susceptible to inaccurate beliefs. There are direct implications for older person’ vulnerability to financial fraud, tendencies to remember false information as true, which influences judgment. Therefore, age-related declines in ability of the prefrontal cortex to doubt provide a compelling rationale as to why highly knowledgeable and intelligent adult are often susceptible to deception and fraud. Optimism bias is a tendency for people to overestimate their likelihood of experiencing a wide variety of pleasant events, such as enjoying their first job or having a gifted child, and somewhat underestimate their risk of succumbing to negative events, such as getting divorced or falling victim to a chronic disease. This illusory nature of optimism is also evident in peoples' under-estimation of the time taken for a variety of tasks.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.

Another factor to consider is the interaction between food and medication. It's important to educate yourself and your loved one about these interactions to avoid any potential complications. In addition to nutrition and medication, regular exercise is also crucial for maintaining long-term health. Regular check-ups and screenings are also important in maintaining long-term health. Maintaining an active social life, engaging in hobbies or activities that bring joy, and staying mentally stimulated are all important for overall health and quality of life. By considering these key factors - nutrition, medication interactions, exercise, regular check-ups, and social/mental well-being - you can help ensure the long-term health of your aging parents or loved ones. Eliminate refined sugars; instead choose whole fresh fruits and vegetables and other sources of complex carbohydrates.Take a close look at your diet and see what improvements you can make.Get regular exercise.Avoid caffeine and other stimulants.If you drink alcohol, do so only in moderation.Do not use tobacco in any form; if necessary, seek help to quit smoking.It is also clear that the effects of classical nutritional deficiency diseases upon mental function constitute only a small part of a rapidly expanding list of interfaces between nutrition and the mind.\" It should not surprise you to learn that these substances are critically important if your body is to manufacture adequate supplies of serotonin and other neurotransmitters. Assuming no underlying organic illness is present, the next steps are to address the issues of mental attitude, lifestyle, and nutrition. Perform mental relaxation and stress reduction exercises such as those described in Chapter 4. Do not use tobacco in any form; if necessary, seek help to quit smoking.

This follows the upward trend of smoking that peaked 20 years prior due to its social pervasiveness, global association with glamour and camaraderie, and the heavy influence of the tobacco industry. Ernst Wynder was a medical student when he came up with the idea to link smoking with cancer when he witnessed the blackened lungs of a man with lung cancer and later learned that he was a heavy smoker. Although Graham did not believe in the increased risk of lung cancer from smoking, as he smoked excessively, he enabled Wynder to \n\n a case-control study by providing subjects with lung cancer to interview. In 1948, Wynder began distributing questionnaires at Bellevue Hospital asking individual habits, such as smoking, and by 1949 he had data from over 200 patients that proved smoking and lung cancer were correlated. When these findings were presented at the American Cancer Society 1949 national meeting, the lack of audience response reflected a dismissal of smoking as a causal factor for lung cancer. The 1950 Wynder and Graham Study was the first large-scale study to investigate link between smoking and cancer. It differed from previous studies because of the size of the test group, and clear, statistically-significant results.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about human aging.
