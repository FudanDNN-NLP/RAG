A Boolean-valued model for the language L consists of a universe M, which is a set of elements (or names), together with interpretations for the symbols. Interpretation of the atomic formulas of L is more complicated. To each pair a and b of elements of M, the model must assign a truth value ||a = b|| to the expression a = b; this truth value is taken from the Boolean algebra B. Similarly, for each n-ary relation symbol R of L and each n-tuple &lt;a0,...,an-1&gt; of elements of M, the model must assign an element of B to be the truth value ||R(a0,...,an-1)||.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about formal logic.

These are statements about the entire logic, and are usually tied to some notion of a model. However, there are local notions of consistency and completeness that are purely syntactic checks on the inference rules, and require no appeals to models. It is a check on the strength of elimination rules: they must not be so strong that they include knowledge not already contained in their premises. Its intended semantics is bivalent and its main property is that it is strongly complete, otherwise said that whenever a formula semantically follows from a set of premises semantically, it also follows from that set syntactically. able to express by composition all n-ary truth tables), and in the exact complete choice of axioms over the chosen basis of connectives. interpretation of all the sentence letters Φ and Ψ (i.e., after assigning a truth-value to each sentence letter), we can determine the truth-values of all formulas that have them as constituents, as a function of the logical connectives. The first two columns show the truth-values of the sentence letters as determined by the four possible interpretations. Now it is easier to see what makes a formula logically valid. Assume that we have a sound (and hence consistent) and complete axiomatization of all true first-order logic statements about natural numbers. Falsifiability in the implicational propositional calculus is NP-complete, meaning that validity (tautology) is co-NP-complete. If one succeeds, then it is indeed not a tautology. If one fails, then it is a tautology.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about formal logic. Answer the question by choosing \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" or \"D\".
