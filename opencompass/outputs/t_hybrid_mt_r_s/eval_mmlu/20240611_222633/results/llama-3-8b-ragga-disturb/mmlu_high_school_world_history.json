By contrast, China, especially after the mid-1300s, was threatened mainly by highly mobile steppe nomads, against whom early gunpowder weapons, with their unwieldiness, proved of little utility. It therefore devoted its efforts to the improvement of horse archer units who could effectively combat the country's deadliest foe.\nThe argument in this passage most closely relates to which of the following large-scale questions about global history?\nA.

One is inhabited by Muslims and has twelve mosques, salaried imams and muezzins, and jurists and scholars. In the environs are wells with sweet water, from which they drink and with which they grow vegetables. . . . The king's interpreters, the official in charge of his treasury and the majority of his ministers are Muslims. Only royalty may wear sewn clothes. All other people wear robes of cotton, silk, or brocade, according to their means. . . . The king adorns himself like a woman, wearing necklaces round his neck and bracelets on his forearms. . . . He sits . . . in a domed pavilion around which stand ten horses. When people who profess the same religion as the king approach him they fall on their knees and sprinkle dust on their heads, for this is their way of greeting him. As for the Muslims, they greet him only by clapping their hands. [The people's] religion is paganism and the worship of idols. . . . On every donkey-load of salt when it is brought into the country their king levies one golden dinar, and two dinars when it is sent out. From a load of copper the king's due is five mithqals, and from a load of other goods ten mithqals. . . . The nuggets found in all the mines of his country are reserved for the king, only this gold dust being left for the people. But for this the people would accumulate gold until it lost its value. Beyond this country lies another called Malal, the king of which was sincerely attached to Islam, while the common people of his kingdom remained polytheists.

Additionally, Indonesia was not distracted by said inclination and will continue development efforts through special autonomy and will also continue friendly relations with Vanuatu. Pakistan responded to the statement by the Bangladeshi prime minister in saying that it was deeply dismayed as Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries and were once citizens of the same country and also continue to have warmth today. They added that the statement by Hasina was misrepresentation of the facts, the premise was wrong and the legal dimension was untenable. unhelpful and counter productive to Bangladesh-Pakistan relations.

At the height of chaos and violence during the early Bersiap period of the Indonesian revolution Sjahrir published an epoch-making pamphlet named 'Our Struggle'. Originally published in Dutch as 'Indonesische Overpeinzingen' ('Indonesian Musings'), it was soon thereafter translated into the Indonesian language as 'Perdjoeangan Kita' in 1945, and was then translated into the English language by Charles Wolf Jr. and named 'Out of Exile' published by John Day, New York, 1949.

In the Asia-Pacific, asthma and COPD are particularly relevant as risk factors such as smoking, biomass fuels, pollution, and tuberculosis (TB) are higher than in other regions. She has had major roles in advocacy and leadership for lung health in Australia, chairing the National Asthma Campaign, the Federal Government’s National Asthma Advisory Group and many local and international guidelines and implementation initiatives to enhance resources, skills, capacity and clinical outcomes in airways disease. In 2002 she was made a Member in the Order of Australia for recognition of service to respiratory medicine as a physician, administrator and educator, especially in the field of asthma education. She is on the Board of the Lung Foundation Australia, and is a member of the Thoracic Society of Australia and New Zealand, the American Thoracic Society, European Respirator Society and the Asian Pacific Society of Respirology. So we now define severe asthma as asthma symptoms and abnormal lung function that persist despite optimal medication, both adherence and prescribing of appropriate medication and when you know for certain that the patient is adherent and they’re receiving the best possible medications on offer, and they’re pursuing a healthy lifestyle, but they still have symptoms, abnormal lung function and exacerbations, then they have severe asthma. Their treatments are never completely controlling their events, in terms of exacerbations and so they’ve never had a prolonged symptom for an interval, where as many people with asthma who are well treated achieve very prolonged periods without any symptoms, as long as they’re taking their medication. But for some people, it’s just an evolution that never has a complete answer, you can never entirely say what brought it on, but their asthma gets out of control. There are some countries that have attempted asthma epidemiologic studies, but the prevalence of asthma in Asia is lower than it is in many Anglo-Saxon western countries. In Asia, it’s about half that and as I mentioned to you, there is also only a small proportion of people with asthma who have severe asthma. Yes, the prevalence of asthma and severe asthma is much higher in Australia, New Zealand, the UK, Canada, some parts of Europe, but in fact, we do have a high burden of asthma in our part of the world here in Australia and New Zealand and many of the leading clinical research papers have come out of Australia and New Zealand for that very reason. Obviously we do have better epidemiologic records and so there may well be some underreporting, underdiagnosing in Asia of course, because access to medical services is not as good as it is in many other parts of the world. So it may be our Anglo-Saxon inheritance is really important, certainly most of us, strongly believe asthma is a consequence of genes and environment, you need both and so although we have a relatively clean environment, we have one that is very allergen rich, we have a temperate environment and fungi and mites and moulds and pollens, they all love our environment, so those sorts of exposures are one of the things that causes the inflammation of asthma – so, a range of different range of reasons, but we definitely do see lower prevalence’s in Asia than in Australia and New Zealand. Australia made asthma a national health priority back around 2000; we’ve built really good education into primary care settings, so primary care doctors are very aware of asthma as a problem. Asia is important because it’s untapped and it’s an opportunity and there is still a very significant proportion of the population who have asthma who don’t receive good medication and good quality care. So there’s a real opportunity to conduct clinical trials there and we at the George have basis in Asia, which enables us to do those trials really well to a very high professional standard and with the unique contribution that we have from the scientists in the George and the clinicians in the George along with our clinical operations capacity, we can really deliver very strongly in asthma and COPD studies. So I think the future is much brighter than it was but it is most bright for younger people who have severe asthma, because they are going to start treatments that are going to intervene in the disease much earlier and are then going to prevent the loss of lung function that happens of over time. So COPD is growing in prevalence because of the very wide spread exposure particularly to tobacco but still in many countries, to dusty jobs, biomass fuel exposure and significant irritancy that contributes such as air pollution. Air pollution is still a major problem especially in many parts of Asia and along with the other exposures it is contributing to the increase of prevalence in COPD. Asia is a really important region for running clinical trials in COPD. Many Asian countries have guidelines for COPD management but one of the big challenges is access to good quality education, self-management, primary care and medications.

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

Here we had not only a servile war, but we had a war of religion, a war of race, and a war of revenge, of hope, of national promptings to shake off the yoke of a stranger, and to re-establish the full power of native chiefs, and the full sway of native religions. Whatever the causes of the mutiny and the revolt, it is clear enough that one of the modes by which the leaders, as if by common instinct, determined to effect their end was, the destruction of every white man, woman or child who fell into their hands.\nBritish journalist William Howard Russell, My Indian Mutlny Diary, 1860\nViolence, it must be emphasized, was an essential component of the British presence in India. A dominant power is always uneasy with violence directed against it. The right to violence is, therefore, everywhere a privilege that authority enjoys and refuses to share with those under it: power always insists on violence as its exclusive monopoly. British rule in India, as an autocracy, had meticulously constructed a monopoly of violence. The revolt of 1857 shattered that monopoly by matching an official, alien violence by an indigenous violence of the colonized. The bodies of the British had acquired certain dignities in India that were predestined by birth and by the colour of their skin. This was the condition of their domination, of their superiority: rulers and ruled were arranged hierarchically as superior and inferior races, as civilized and uncivilized. And this superiority manifested itself by denying to the Indians a \"humanness\"; by treating them and conceiving of them as animals.\nRudrangshu Mukherjee, \"The Kanpur [Cawnpore] Massacres in India in the Revolt of 1857,\" 1990\nAccording to the second passage, the Cawnpore Massacre\nA. was justifiable according to local military custom, even if it violated Western military norms.\nB. can be viewed as a reaction to the systemic brute force with which the British governed India.\nC. should be praised as a brave patriotic blow against British colonial oppression.\nD. seems to have been the product of a well-organized and long-premeditated conspiracy.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt.

On the other hand, many poor peasants are still living in poverty for lack of sufficient means of production, with some in debt and others selling or renting out their land. If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties. Nor will the well-to-do middle peasants who are heading in the capitalist direction be pleased with us, for we shall never be able to satisfy their demands unless we intend to take the capitalist road. Can the worker-peasant alliance continue to stand in these circumstances? Obviously not! There is no solution to this problem except on a new basis. And that means to bring about, step by step, the socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture simultaneously with the gradual realization of socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce; in other words, it means to carry out co-operation and eliminate the rich-peasant economy and the individual economy in the countryside so that all the rural people will become increasingly well off together. We maintain that this is the only way to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.\"\nMao Zedong, On the Question of Agricultural Co-operation, 1955\nWhich of the following best explains Mao's concept of the \"socialist transformation of the whole of agriculture\" in China?\nA.

Surgery that can be used to improve heart failure includes coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), valve replacement surgery and heart transplantation (see also ‘Medical devices for heart failure' and 'heart transplants for heart failure'). She persuaded her surgeon to operate on her and felt her quality of life improved. And just a good job that he was here because I collapsed and got rushed into hospital, spent 7 weeks in there because, you know, having 5 operations is a bit dicey as you can well imagine. He said, 'He may not want to do but I think it's worth going for, how you do feel?' And I said, 'Well I don't want to be like this for what days I've got left' because I couldn't walk, I couldn't do anything. And I said to him 'oh dear' and he said, 'You surely don't want me to operate on you?' And he said, 'Well I'm not going to give you an answer now, I'll have to go away and really think about it'. The first thing he said to me when he saw me after I'd had it was 'amazing'. He just stood at the bottom of my bed and said 'amazing, absolutely amazing'. You know, we have to think of where we're going or what we're doing and then my husband likes me only to do one thing a day. Coronary artery bypass surgery, also known as Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG, pronounced \"cabbage\") is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. Sab avoided a heart attack just because during a consultation for a lung condition he told the consultant about his chest pain. Sab is married with four grown up children and several grandchildren. Ethnic background' Asian. My wife jumped in and said, \"Tell him about the pain you had,\" and he sort of looked at me and said, \"What pain?\" So I explained to him so he said, \"We'll do a GC,\" what do you call it? So he found phoned up and we had that done and it was showing a little blip and then from then on he sent me for more tests so for the next six, seven months I did all the tests, treadmill and so on and finally I went for an angiogram and then they found out that is was much worse than it actually showed and the doctor agreed that they couldn't put the stent in because that would be more dangerous, it would be more than one stent so they decided they wanted to do a triple bypass so then asked me to wait for a date and then they give me a date on December 1st , Thursday and do the operation at 1.30 and, and that's when the operation took place and instead of doing triple bypass then I was told it was a five grafting that they had to do because it was, artery was so bad. But then when you're taken to [the specialist hospital] and you actually see on the screen the effects of what's going on and then somebody says, 'we're requesting surgical intervention immediately,' it is a shock of some magnitude. Yeah, I knew that, yeah, yeah I knew that there was something seriously wrong with a fundamental part of your anatomy and they'd got to do something about it. She was so comforting and sympathetic and I, I think I was in tears, not from a weakness point of view but sheer frustration and aggression. One man reported how the surgeon described the operation to him before he asked him to sign the consent form for bypass surgery. Well along comes the surgeon who said he thought he could do it against the advice of all the others but he got the vote that day. You see I could quite understand they don't want to lose a patient, it's not good for them to lose a patient and if the chances are 50/50, I think they'd rather take their 50 on their side and have you die at home than on their table. That is fair enough, but then from the patient's point of view, who hasn't got much chance anyway, she would rather take the chance on the other side of the 50 and go ahead. And he explained that progressively they was going to remove all the different pipes, and the purpose for them and everything else, and I thought it was marvellous that a surgeon would take the time out to explain everything he was going to do, or had done, in the next few days. So the only person that was really good, as far as I was concerned, was the surgeon and he didn't mince his words, you know, he spat it straight out. He called a spade, a spade and I loved that, I knew exactly where I stood. I knew the risk from living and dying on the operation or from a stroke and everything else and that's the way I like it, I knew exactly where I stood. I knew the odds were against me but I went for it. I'm telling you this because one of the things that the surgeon told us was that the, one of the things that I wanted to know from the surgeon was how many of these things had he done. Was he, sort of, did he know what he was doing and he told me, this was September, he told me by that time he had done about 140 bypass operations that year. So that was you know, quite reassuring. Some people felt they wanted to have surgery; for instance a man who had CABG surgery because doctors thought it would prevent sudden death, said that he wanted to feel everything was being done that could be done (for more information see 'Sudden arrhythmic death syndrome' Information sheet from the British Heart Foundation January 2013). He had bypass surgery to reduce his chances of sudden death. The muscle of my heart is badly damaged, and my specialists told me it was unlikely that surgery would actually improve the quality of the muscle that had already been damaged, but my chance of sudden death would be reduced they felt, so I went forward for a coronary artery bypass operation in January of 2002, a little uncertain as to whether it had been a sensible thing to do, because I think the evidence as to whether I should have been managed medically or go through the surgery were pretty finely balanced. I think my family were keen though that I had the surgery and it was important to me that everything was being demonstrated to be done that could be done. As I say there was quite a delay sometimes between me developing problems of my rhythm and somebody actually deciding what to do about it, and that is one of the disadvantages of being a doctor in that situation. Sometimes people had expected tests to lead to some kind of surgery and felt slightly disappointed to learn that surgery would not help them. And that's what I've been doing ever since, know what I mean. In his first marriage he had three children; two in their fifties and one is deceased. I had no symptoms of a problem prior to that but, but it is believed that, that, the poor fitting of the two valves resulted in the heart having to work harder and this resulted in the left ventricle weakening and so the decision was taken that heart surgery would not help me and therefore the only invasion of my body that I’ve had [laughs] is a pacemaker and an angiogram but I’ve had no other surgery. Its not difficult to live with now, its annoying its restrictive, at first it was terrifying when the limitations of what you could and couldn't do was brought home to you. The medicine that I'm on, the treatment with medicine, is not going to cure, it will prevent hopefully, any further damage, or will slow down further damage, it won't cure it, and I'm all right with that, because I could be an awful lot worse off than what I am, and it has been explained to me, by the powers that be, that if it does get worse, what the position is gonna be. But nobody told me that, nobody..if it was on records its never been explained that I was setting out thinking I'd been almost cured by bypass surgery, only to find it wasn't so. Sab talks about how he felt and looked like following his CABG surgery. Unbelievable pain, unbearable pain , you can't breathe properly, you can't turn, you just sit still, there's no sleep for three days but you want to close your eyes to sleep but they made no difference and the experience I had, I forgot it and tell is that the dreams that you hallucinate, hallucinations. And that was a scary part and being on your own in this private room, nobody else then, no visitors and you're looking round and you can't understand, you can't move, you can't really shout, you can press a button for a nurse if you want to and you even shout, \"Why is that happening, what's wrong?\" And then, those, for two days was like that and it was so scary to shut the eyes and it was so scary to open the eyes so you didn't know what, which, you know dimension you were in and how do you get out of here. and it was so difficult. And day and night were just the same, there was, you know, you couldn't, it was nothing to look forward to whether it was daytime or night time so those were the first two days. And then what… I think about two, two days later then you get up and you drag these things with you to go to toilet and the first time they took a tube out, out of m what do they call it, the willy? And so that was a horrendous experience and once I started walking and I was, after three days I was walking up and down the hallway to get yourself fit and I then got better, then I had, one of the male nurse give me a shower which was brilliant and from then on the things got better and better then I was eating a little bit more, drinking a lot, I drank so much water. I remember my first day when I realised I was awake that they said the more water I drink the quicker, better I will get. It was so bad to the extent that I couldn't touch it, I couldn't touch the scar. and one of the questions was \"What do you think about dying?\" and I laughed and said \"You don't know what I went through so dying is yeah I'm fine, don't worry I'll sign the form.\" They were, actually some, the wires, the metal wires were hitting some sort of, some nerves stuck in the middle and literally it was just like an electric shock, every time you touched the scar it was just like an electric shock goes through your body \"Argh\". And then for the next few days of being home was very, very emotional and because you can't do very much, you sit and everybody doing everything for you, they're running up and down and every time I moved, \"What would you like?\" And another friend of mine who also had a triple bypass a year earlier and he came to see me and talked to me about the thing I was going through is normal you know, that you will feel a pain, you don't want, you can't walk, you don't feel like to eat and so this is normal but it get better and, and support from families and friends I think that was the biggest help and encouragement to move on and do that. And then as the thing got better, I think about four or five weeks later I went to walk for forty five minutes and I went from [Village] to [Town] and back which is about just under three miles and I felt brilliant. So from then on, you know, it got better and better and the next, my aim was to go and play golf and I remember going to check up in hospital and say, \"Everything's fine we don't need to see you anymore, you are discharged from hospital,\" which was the more really a reassurance and give me more confidence. And I came home and just carried on, you know, as a normal life – walking and lots of walking and doing things, not sitting down and feeling sorry for myself and that's something you must learn to do. You know it's a wonderful world out there, you need to make effort and believe in yourself and you go and do things that you want to do.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school world history.

From eastern Europe to southern China, merchants and travelers could move across the well-policed Mongol domains without fear for their lives or property. The great swath of Mongol territory that covered or connected most of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East served as a bridge between the civilizations of the Eastern Hemisphere. The caravans and embassies that crossed the Mongol lands transmitted new food, inventions, and ideas from one civilized pool to others and from civilized pools to the nomadic peoples who served as intermediaries. Secure trade routes made for prosperous merchants and wealthy, cosmopolitan cities. They also facilitated the spread of foods [and] inventions . . . a major force for economic and social development and the enhancement of civilized life.\n—Robert Guisepi, 1992\nThe Mongol empire used which of the following to integrate its vast, geographically diverse area?\nA.
