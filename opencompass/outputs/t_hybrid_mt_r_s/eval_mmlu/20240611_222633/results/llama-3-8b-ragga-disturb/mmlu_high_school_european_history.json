Huxley provided an introduction to Krishnamurti's quintessential statement, The First and Last Freedom (1954).

Not long afterwards, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, The Perennial Philosophy, which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world.

It does not identify mental disorder – that is determined by the individual society – but it claims to be able to explain all cases of mental disorder as a matter of disturbed brain function. As such, it is an example of what is called physical reductionism, the philosophical system that says that all complex matters can be explained in terms of the subsystems that make them up. In biology, reductionism says that the complex behavior of a large organism can only be understood in terms of understanding the cells that make up the organism. Therefore, the correct approach to mental behavior is to analyze it in terms of the cells of the brain, known as neurons. Since, it is claimed, disturbed behavior is always and only due to disturbances of neuronal function, treatment of mental disorder will consist of interventions at the chemical level, meaning using drugs and occasionally physical treatment such as ECT, magnetic stimulation or even brain surgery. The first and most obvious objection is to deny that mental disorder exists. Over some sixty years, he has taken a rigid and uncompromising line that there is no such thing as mental disorder, that it is an artificial construct which is of no value to the individuals, even if it helps society (by getting rid of nuisances) and enriches the various mental health professions. They have no problem with the idea that, if anything disturbs mental life, it must be in the body, because bodies are very faulty. It is possible to object to biological psychiatry on what are called esthetic or moral grounds, the notion that it isn’t fair or decent to lock people in secure buildings and force them to take unpleasant drugs against their will. Essentially, this is a human-centered approach which does not appeal to a divine authority or any force stronger than the question: “How would you feel if this were done to you or your wife/son/mother?” It says that humans are not just cattle but have feelings which have to be taken into account and not crushed underfoot for bureaucratic convenience. The psychological model says that mental disorder is a feeling state induced by intrapsychic disturbances in the mind, not chemical disturbances in the brain, and chemistry is therefore only of marginal significance in psychiatric disorders. Therefore, they would say, the correct form of treatment is not to suppress mental symptoms with drugs because they are important pointers to the actual intrapsychic problems to be rectified, and treatment can only be done via psychological means, essentially talking and learning. The same standard will also apply to psychological or religious treatment, so that disordered people cannot be forced to participate in, say, rebirthing rituals or exorcisms if they don’t like them. This is not popular among orthodox psychiatrists because one of their strongest arguments has always been: “Ah yes, but we have the science. We have the actual facts about mental disorder and not just silly sentimentalists.” By a lengthy process of analysis of all the claims on which biological psychiatry can logically be based, I have concluded that, in fact, they don’t have the science. I have shown that the central claims of biological psychiatry are false, that it doesn’t make any sense at all when it is examined closely and that it is pure ideology, in the bad sense of the word. My case is based in the philosophy of science, meaning that I use only the same standards of science as are used in all other fields of investigation, and biological psychiatry fails the lot. Conclusion: Objections to biological psychiatry are valid. This is partly because anybody is allowed to object to any part of western science, because criticism is an essential part of the scientific tradition. It is valid partly because no one group can monopolize the thought processes of a civilization (diversity breeds progress) and also because modern western science makes no claims about mental life qua sentience. Western materialist science cannot handle mentality, so it tries to get it out of the equation. I cannot see one shadow or tittle of evidence that the great unknown underlying the phenomenon of the universe stands to us in the relation of a Father [who] loves us and cares for us as Christianity asserts. So with regard to the other great Christian dogmas, immortality of soul and future state of rewards and punishments, what possible objection can I—who am compelled perforce\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

A church leader in the 4th century Eusebius wrote ‘it was not by mere human accident but of God's arrangement that the universal empire of peace came in time for the universal religion of peace.’ The Roman peace at the time however was still regularly sustained \n\n According to Rodney Stark, since Christians most likely formed only sixteen to seventeen percent of the empire's population at the time of Constantine's conversion, they did not have the numerical advantage to form a sufficient power–base to begin a systematic persecution of pagans. However, Brown reminds us \"We should not underestimate the fierce mood of the Christians of the fourth century\", nor should it be forgotten that repression, persecution and martyrdom do not generally breed tolerance of those same persecutors. Rome had been removing anything it saw as a challenge to Roman identity since Bacchic associations were dissolved in 186 BCE. That military action against a mystical religion became the pattern for the Roman state's response to anything it saw as a religious threat. To do this more effectively, they ransacked pagan Latin writings, particularly those of Varro, for everything that could be regarded by Christian standards as repulsive and irreligious.\" These Christian sources have had great influence on perceptions of this period by creating an impression of overt and continuous conflict that has been assumed on an empire-wide scale. Archaeological evidence indicates that, outside of violent rhetoric, the decline of paganism away from the imperial court was relatively non-confrontational. These traditional accounts were first questioned in the Enlightenment, when Henry Dodwell, Voltaire, and, most famously, Edward Gibbon questioned traditional accounts of the Christian martyrs. In the final chapter of the first volume of his History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776), Gibbon claims that Christians had greatly exaggerated the scale of the persecutions they suffered: \"After the church had triumphed over all her enemies, the interest as well as vanity of the captives prompted them to magnify the merit of their respective sufferings.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

It was also cited as an emanation of obscurantism by many Enlightenment philosophers, including Voltaire and Alexandre Dumas. In chapter 31 of his Philosophie de l'histoire, Voltaire wrote: Most of the predictions were those from the Almanach de Liège – \"A great man will die, there will be shipwrecks\". Did a judge in the village die that year? For the village, this was the death that had been predicted. – that's the shipwrecks they announced.

France in the Enlightenment has been met with a considerable degree of criticism. D. M. G. Sutherland, another revolutionary historian, criticizes the Roche’s overly progressive take on the Enlightenment that tends to accept the Enlightenment’s own discourse on itself, disregarding anything that preceded it as being backward. On France in the Enlightenment, Sutherland says \"Daniel Roche has written the history of France in the Enlightenment that intellectuals tried to compel us to write over two hundred and fifty years ago.\" The progressive tone of the France in the Enlightenment is contradicted by other research, most notably the work of Robert Darnton, \n\nTell me a little bit about your job and more specifically about you Neonatal Comfort Care Program. The official name is Neonatal Comfort Care Program and it’s a service of perinatal and neonatal palliative care, so our team takes care of babies before and after birth. In the latter case, a baby may not live longer than a few minutes or a few hours after birth, however some of these newborns go on to live for days or weeks and there is really no standard of care for them. Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. And I should be able to address desires and expectations of their families.” My first case was a little girl with Trisomy 18 who lived for two weeks. This little girl was held all day long by her mom and fed with breast milk that mom pumped every three hours until the day when her breathing became very light and her heart slowed down and stopped. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. After her, I started following other mothers and other babies and the number of families I have been following has been greatly increasing over time. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Some babies were born in other institutions in U.S., or even internationally; for instance, I followed a family via Skype in Dubai, and a number of families in Italy. It is devastating. Imagine: You discover you are having a baby, what joyful news! But suddenly you learn from the obstetricians that your baby has something really bad that will make his or her life short. It’s, I would say, one of the worst news you could receive. You expect old people to die, not little babies. For instance, when you are pregnant and your belly starts to show, you go to work, and people ask, “When is the baby due? How many times do you see pregnant women in the checkout line and even if you don’t know them, you’ll congratulate them and ask them about the baby’s gender? These families need to learn how to communicate this not only with those outside the family, but even in the family: how to tell the other siblings without crushing their hearts, how to tell your own parents, or figuring out who you want to tell. But even after they’re born, they will be held, they will be fed, they will be warm, and they won’t experience any pain. So, their life will be short but, for them, it will be a beautiful experience of love and welcoming.” Depending on the family’s background—religious, social, racial, etc.—we try to craft a plan that follows the medical and non-medical needs of each baby. We also prepare plan A and plan B for each baby, because we never know how the baby is going to react after birth. In short, we do follow the babies along their natural life. They come to us destroyed. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. The experience is not easy, rather quite dramatic. Fathers especially are very worried about facing the moment of birth followed by death. However, I am not sure about the “comfort” they receive because they are very often kept in an incubator until they die. These are centers where there are obstetricians who follow and support women expecting babies with life-limiting conditions. They support mothers in pregnancy and delivery, but there is really no proposal for the baby after birth. What is really special here is that our team is involved at the moment of prenatal diagnosis, during delivery welcoming the baby and seeing what medical needs the baby has, following the baby afterwards, and following the family long-term for years. What makes us different is the continuity of care which includes the care of mom, baby, and family. I want babies to live and have a happy life. I never thought about palliative care as something that would interest me because I want babies to live, obviously. This kind of approach became my love because, again, I want to save babies’ lives, but to save their lives is to save whatever life they’re supposed to have. If my medical knowledge and experience cannot heal their illness and make them healthy, I need to stay with them up to very last moment. It’s a very rewarding experience because I can satisfy their needs all throughout their life and also support their parents in a situation which seems impossible to face. In fact, how can you face your child dying in your arms? From a professional point of view this innovative program is also satisfying. But it is also satisfying to me because it is an answer to a need that I had. Survival is not possible, even with the use of life support. This mom was offered the option to terminate the pregnancy, but she said, “No. I would like to see him, to hold him, to kiss him, and to protect his life up to the very end.” So, I met her with my team, we gave her our proposal, and made a plan. She held her baby to her chest for seven hours and she really had an experience of motherhood. Yes, there is life before death and she was fully living her motherhood. And indeed, the diagnosis was confirmed. However, we noticed something peculiar. Obviously, her condition is life-limiting, her heart will not be able to carry on for many years. We don’t condemn anybody to death. It is about Siamese twins. They refused, however, saying simply, “These are our babies.” So, they opted to carry the babies to term. Furthermore, they had to be delivered prematurely by caesarian section because their mother had developed very high blood pressure. Many people were commenting that the woman should have terminated the pregnancy. There were some medical students present who were ready with their cameras to take pictures of the “rare case.” In the midst of all of these people, not one was interested in welcoming the babies. And then the children were delivered, and there they were: two beautiful little girls embracing each other, as they had been united at the chest their entire lives. I saw tears, people were embracing the young father, and the cameras had disappeared. The people were the same, and yet they were completely changed. It was a moment of beauty, because beauty is the splendor of truth and the truth was that they are. These babies are ― they exist ― and the only possible explanation for their existence is that someone called them to life. The fact that everybody was changed, that everybody was moved, bears witness to this, and it is further evidence that we all share the same heart despite differing ideologies or preconceptions. Your project, instead, seems to affirm life without being ideological. That’s why we propose our option to families who receive a bad diagnosis during pregnancy and are open with us, but we are open to the fact that occasionally there are families who, after meeting us, decide otherwise. We propose that it is possible to be parents and hold your baby in your arms even if his or her life is very brief. This is a choice that allows one to fully experience motherhood and fatherhood. That’s why, after we offer our proposal, the vast majority of families we meet follows us. I am convinced that each mother and father has an irrevocable, original, and fundamental desire to support life and to love their babies as much as they can. That desire is always present even if people make other choices, and it’s not for me to say anything about that. Our proposal is meant to support this irrevocable desire and we are available to anyone who would like to follow our plan. Everything else is ideological and I have no interest in discussing it. They always follow us, they surprise us, they are very strong, and they make us and their families happy. While we keep in mind each family’s desires and expectations, we are about what the baby needs to feel, what the baby needs to hear, and so the program is very much baby-oriented because those are my champions. We also understand that we can’t possibly take care of all babies in need of our help and, in reality, our vision is to spread this approach and make it available all over the world. Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury (1715-1810) was a member of the distinguished Joly de Fleury family, originally from Burgundy, from which came a number of leading French magistrates and officials under the ancien regime. He is notable for four principal things: his strong opposition to the philosophes and the publication of the Encyclopedie in 1759; his role in the expulsion of the Jesuits; his involvement in the Lally Tollendal Affair; and his ban on inoculation against smallpox in June 1763. In a pun on his name, Voltaire described him as ‘ni Homère, ni joli, ni fleuri' ( = neither Homer, nor pretty, nor flowery, a sarcastic comment on his apparently dreary oratory). In one of his private letters, Voltaire described him as a ‘little black balloon puffed up with stinking vapours’\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

If anyone habitually living at Court absented himself he insisted on knowing the reason; those who came there only for flying visits had also to give a satisfactory explanation; anyone who seldom or never appeared there was certain to incur his displeasure.

A relatively early critic was Friedrich Nietzsche, who called the grandiose claim in the first stanza (\"Deutschland über alles\") \"die blödsinnigste Parole der Welt\" (the most idiotic slogan in the world), and in Thus Spoke Zarathustra said, \"Deutschland, Deutschland über alles – I fear that was the end of German philosophy.\" The pacifist Kurt Tucholsky was also negative about the song, and in 1929 published a photo book sarcastically titled Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, criticising right-wing groups in Germany.

He was encouraged to turn to literature by his friend the marquis of Mirabeau, author of L'Ami des Hommes, and father of the statesman. Wishing to enter the diplomatic service, for two years he made applications to ministers and to king Louis XV himself. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Vauvenargues nevertheless came close to securing a diplomatic appointment, thanks to the intervention of Voltaire. But he contracted smallpox, which disfigured him, rendered him nearly blind, and left him with a chronic cough. Voltaire then asked him to submit to him his ideas on the difference between Jean Racine and \n\n exchange letters and ideas. He briefly returned to Paris where he lived with painter Émile Schuffenecker, but returned to Pont-Aven in the spring of 1889 only to find it too crowded. Gauguin moved farther away \"to escape the tourists and the Parisian and foreign painters\" and arrived at Le Pouldu on October 2, 1889. He found lodgings with Meijer de Haan at Buvette de la Plage, an inn run by Marie Henry. De Haan introduced Gauguin to Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus (1836) by way of conversation. Although he would not read the novel for several more years, Gauguin became \n\nA Pox Upon You. Most pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria from scratching. Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. Then later we realize -- or maybe we don't but others do-- the bitterness has begun to creep into all aspects of our lives. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. The pain of anger, bitterness and hatred has taken over. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Paul said \"let ALL bitterness\" I suppose because he meant ALL. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. complicated, the systems are designed to require us to reset our passwords every 180 days. I have had to email Delanea at Information Systems numerous times for her to reset my password. I am glad she has such a wonderful attitude about her job and she never seems to tire of me requesting again to have my password reset. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. from experience, I consider this to be a perfect descriptor. Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then there \"shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.\" ...weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\" Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. It looks good on the outside, but it has no true function. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How often is my motive the love of God and the love of neighbour and how often is it something else? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Where is the destination for your life? It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. It hasn't ceased to be. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. Jackson, however, was nervous for her. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It was only halfway through the class before he realized she was going to be ok that he finally relaxed. During the Olympics we saw glimpses of love when a winning athlete would run into the arms of a mother or father for a long and tearful embrace. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). \"And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us,\" (Romans 5:5). .\" Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). Nothing in this life is truly neutral in relation to eternity. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. South Alabama was playing Nicholls State from Thibodaux, Louisiana and one of their players was injured. We waited as the trainers attended him but when the cart wheeled onto the field we realized it might be more serious that just a pulled muscle or a cramp. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. These two teams, who had been fiercely playing against each other for half the game, came together to pray for the player who was hurt. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. For some, I don't believe the images and thoughts will ever be erase. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. The life of service does not stop because one has clocked out. Many who did so never returned. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. I remember at the end of my pregnancy with our youngest daughter Emmie, I was working full time at a busy University Center Labor & Delivery. The next night my physician wrote a note on my door saying no one should enter unless I called them. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. He would have us to rest as peacefully in Him as that little newborn daughter rested in my arms in those days I was wanting sleep. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Not only in the future for that rest of eternity, but in this very minute of toil and turmoil. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. At the end of the episode Barney confronts the farmers and finds his inner strength. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. If we want to know what God the Spirit is like, we just look at the Lord Jesus. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He fed them. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need of which our Heavenly Father is unaware. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I think it is both fitting and ironic that became a Labor Room nurse. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" Now, I had never wanted to be a nurse, had never planned to be a nurse, had never prepared to be a nurse. But obviously God wanted me to be a nurse. I had not taken Chemistry in high school and I would need it to get into nurses' training. I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. I couldn't take it in night school either. My only choice was to take it in college. I took Chemistry in the accelerated session between the Spring and Summer semester. At least I had a friend in my instructor. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! I now qualify for the senior coffee at McDonald's with a free refill, too! The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. At this point, I think many people begin to feel panicked. Statistically, looking at fifty-five you realize there is no way you are going to live to be 110. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. So when the hands of time seem to be rushing by too fast, let us remember that it is \"early in eternity,\" and we have a long and glorious and never-ending life ahead. boat which allowed them to board, then fleeing to Australia and splitting up: Pain and Rochefort travelled to the United States and then London, arriving on 18 June 1874. Their escape was the only successful one in the history of New Caledonia as a French penal colony, and made headlines in France, as well as being the subject of a Manet painting. Pain quickly got back into contact with the French Press, and in 1877 he was dispatched to report on the Russo-Turkish War for La Lanterne. Bluffing his way into Plevna without a firman from the Ottoman Sultan giving him permission to be there, \n\n June 1918, following the Treaty of Bucharest, he presented his resignation to the Romanian authorities, who had retreated to Iași. When Oltenia had come under German occupation, Sofronie had neither gone to Iași nor stayed at his see, instead hoping to keep his position under the occupiers once the situation had settled down. His stance was rebuked both by the Germans, who arrested him and sent him away, and by Metropolitan Conon Arămescu-Donici, who in September 1917 wrote that starting the previous autumn, Sofronie was absent for several months without his permission and without a regular leave of absence before being detained.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

Postherpetic neuralgia occurs when the nerves have been damaged after an outbreak of shingles. When we first allow bitterness to harbor in our hearts, it doesn't seem too damaging. It's a little thing, a little anger at that person, a little desire for vengeance. We may even forget it is there, but it is and it is growing. It takes root, just like the herpes zoster virus. We aren't just bitter about that one thing, but now it is so easy to be bitter about almost everything. \"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice: And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,\" (Ephesians 4:31,32). He knew that even the tiniest amount of bitterness and wrath would seethe and grow in our hearts until it became a consuming force. Let us take this command to heart and through the grace of God choose to forgive those in our lives based not on their merit, not on our merit, but based solely on the grace and mercy which has been shown to us, \"even as God for Christ's sake\" hath forgiven us. Our preacher told us this past Sunday that the verb tense for this \"ask, seek and knock\" is one of \"keep on asking, keep on seeking and keep on knocking.\" I know there are times when I tire of hearing our grandchildren's constant requests, but God never tires of hearing us come to Him with our needs and desires. We are in a position of communication with Him and a position of faith. We are affirming that we have a dependence upon Him and that we are strong, not in our own strength, but in the \"power of His might.\" So let us have \"boldness and access with confidence by the faith of Him,\" that the Lord we approach in prayer is not only able to do that which we ask, but desires to hear our voice. He never tires of our asking, He never wearies in our seeking, He never cringes at our knocking. We can boldly approach the throne of grace \"that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.\" Then the moment comes when that baby is placed in her arms and her sorrow turns into joy. The tears of pain and frustration still on her cheeks mingle with the tears of relief and exultation. As we walk out this Christian life here on this planet which bears the evidence of being cursed, and as we are reminded we have the enemies of the world, the flesh and the devil to tempt us along the way, we too groan and travail in labor. Our spirits have been redeemed, but we are waiting, as is the whole of creation, for the redemption of our earthly bodies, that fleshly component of ourselves. Let us hold that laboring mother as an example that, as the Apostle Paul said, \"I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,\" (Romans 8:18.) We may have trials and pains, temptations and difficulties here, but there will come a day when all that shall be past and the God and Lord of Glory Himself shall wipe away the tears from our eyes. Then he answered his own question, \"They see God.\" He continued to say that fire can consume, but it also illuminates. The Word of God is a fire to us as Christians. It consumes that which needs to be burned away. .those things in our lives which are not conformed to the image of the Lord Jesus. The three Hebrew men who were captives in Babylon knew about fire and illumination. Nebuchadnezzar threw them into the fiery furnace, but they weren't consumed, they were illuminated. And so was the \"fourth form\" walking in the furnace with them. Nebuchadnezzar said \"the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.\" We all know why he thought the fourth man looked like the Son of God, because He WAS the Son of God. If we are willing to turn on the \"flashlight\" the Lord has given us, He will illuminate us to His presence all around us in our own fiery furnaces. He will reveal Himself to us in ways we never imaged possible and our lives will be a testimony to all who witness it. There were no sides to the fence and no gate. Now a fence normally exists either to contain something, such as a pet or small children, or to protect what is inside of it from intruders. This piece of fence, although pretty, could do neither. It could serve only one purpose, to be seen. It was white enough and it was straight enough, but it had no real functionality, it was simply there for show. This dysfunctional fence made me think of experiences I have had in my own life. Even if the actions are right enough, if the motives are wrong, then the actions are as worthless as that strip of fence. Just what is my motive for the things I do? How many \"Christian\" acts are done out of pride and vanity instead of humility and lowliness of heart? How many church visits are made with the purpose of attracting a date, or a mate, a business deal or higher place in society? May we humble ourselves and ask the Lord to search our hearts and purify our motives so that what we do for Him is truly for Him and not in some way shape or form for ourselves. Our youngest daughter and her boyfriend will still be in college and will have to accommodate their class schedules. Our oldest daughter, an attorney, also has a busy schedule to deal with and she plans to fly as well. Our son has not yet decided how he will arrive, but I doubt he will drive. Regardless of our method of transportation, we each have one thing in common: we have a destination. In our case, we have the same destination. Usually when you board a plane, a train or even take an automobile ride, you do so with a destination in mind. Our lives are a journey as well and at the end, there is a destination. Where is the destination for your life? There will be a station waiting for you depending upon the choices you have made. It really is simple because there are only two choices. You either choose to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your Savior and Lord, and your ticket is stamped with the destination of \"Heaven,\" or you choose not to and you get the default destination. David clearly describes the Great Shepherd leading His dear one through a valley which is shadowed by death. For those who have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior and Lord, there is no death in the sense of ceasing to be. In fact, those who have come to know the Lord are said to have \"eternal life.\" Not only that, but for the Christian, the moment life escapes from our earthly bodies, our spiritual lives are in the presence of the Lord. I personally don't believe that moment of passing from this life to our eternal life, which Paul described as \"far better,\" will be a difficult passage. In fact, I believe it will be just the opposite. The moment a Christian prepares to depart this world and enter into Heaven, I believe the angels of God form such a welcoming party that we could not imagine the wonder of it. And our own Great Shepherd, who ever seeks after that lost sheep, will surely be there to walk us through the \"paths of righteousness\" which He has created with His own nail-scarred feet. The mountain of death may be nearby, but it is only the shadow of death which falls across us, and the shadow cannot hurt us. For us, no climbing of a dreadful mountain, but walking in the sweet valley with our Savior. His father had been a minister throughout his life and even into his last months was faithfully believing and trusting his Lord. As the moments of his passing drew near, those around him said he would look up toward the ceiling and with the look of amazement on his face state, \"Is it really this easy? His first words were, \"I hear your father moved to a better neighborhood.\" As with the rest of our lives, we will not travel it alone, our Shepherd will be there with us and we \"shall not want\" and we \"will fear no evil.\" He laughed and said, \"I don't see the sun,\" and even as he said it he realized he had misunderstood what I had said. That statement is so true. The Lord our God is and has been eternal, He has always been and will always be exactly what He is and He will never do anything which contradicts His nature and character. It is a fact we can believe in even more surely than the sun rising in the east each morning. Thousands of times I have seen a brand-new baby handed into the arms of a new mother. If he suspects she may be fearful, he is there waiting. She was not nervous in any way, shape or form. He didn't want to leave, but sat outside the room and watched through the one-way window. It is because whenever and wherever we see glimpses of love, of true unselfish love, we can know one thing. The Scriptures tell us \"God is love,\" (1 John 4:16) He is somehow the source of all true love and He is the only One who can love in the way that is always true, always unselfish and always faithful in every motive. So somehow in the mystery that is Godliness, when we see these earthly glimpses of true love, we are seeing our Lord manifesting Himself in that situation. He works in and through His children to manifest His character and way and to conform us to the image of His dear Son. When we see these acts of love, it's fine to feel that warmth of heart and even to shed tears, but let us also send up praises to the God who is love and that \"...when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly,\" (Romans 5:6). We live in a sub-tropical location, and our city is the only seaport in our state. The Spanish, Tensaw, Apalachee and Blakeley Rivers run together into Mobile Bay from the northern side, while Dog River, Deer River, and Fowl River run into the bay from the western side. Our city has 118 miles of land area and 41 miles of water area. Not only do we have water all around, but we have water from above, too. Our elevation above all that water is between 10 and 200 feet, depending upon where you live. More than \"winter\" we have an absence of summer, a respite from that heat and humidity. .that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;\" (Titus 2:13). As the Apostle Paul said, \"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope,\" (Romans 15:4). When she comes to visit, she is stuck to me like glue. Not only does He delight in our prayers but our voices are sweet to Him: \"O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely,\" (Song of Solomon 2:14). What an incredible thing to consider that our voice is sweet the the Lord, Creator and Sustainer of the universe. Every interaction we have with others is either positive or negative in the light of eternity. We are either helping them along the way to come to know the Lord initially or we are helping them on their road to rejection of Him. Our contact is not neutral. We are either helping people to live eternally as glorified Christians in the presence and glory of the King of Kings, or we are aiding them to live eternally in the torment and anguish of a lonely, forsaken hell. That may sound pretty extreme, after all, how can we influence people we have only encountered for a few seconds? Have you ever had a brief encounter with someone who literally changed your attitude for the day? Perhaps it was only their smile, or maybe they opened a door for you when your arms were full. Such small things, but small things can have a big impact. I stood in line in my solitude willing the line to move faster. Basically a shy person, I'm not one to strike up a conversation with strangers too much -- that's what my husband does. Her attitude drew me into the conversation --she was like a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie. As we were talking, my husband came back and he, too, began to converse with Irene. We both gave her a big hug and I realized I didn't feel tired anymore, She had been like a dose of medicine. We all know what it is like when we meet negative influences. .but WE can be those negative ones as well. Even if we aren't blatantly negative, mean or hateful, if we reject the opportunity to be positive, the opportunity is lost to positively influence that person, perhaps forever. Let us remember that every person we encounter has been put in our path for a reason. Maybe all we can do is to smile or to say a kind, \"Hello,\" to open a door, or to ease a burden in some way. Let us not lose the opportunities that abound around us. It was then that the entire South Alabama football team and coaches made a huddle around the player and trainers on the field. The crowd was clearly moved. It is not how we respond when we are treated well which most shows the character of our Lord in us, but how we respond when we are ill-treated. We have the example of our Lord to follow and the leading of His Holy Spirit in us to work out His love and mercy and forgiveness in and through us toward others. \"But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.\" As I did I had the same reaction I have had for eleven years. The scar of fear must also remain to some degree or I wouldn't be wondering if that plane is going to crash instead of land. More than 3,051 children lost parents. There were 327 foreign nationals killed from 53 countries. The United Kingdom lost more people than any other country other than our own. Especially let us remember the bravery of the firefighters and policemen who ran toward the burning buildings as everyone else was running away. Many who did so never returned. We have a great land. One of the things that makes our country great are the everyday people who are willing to leave the safety of their home and sacrifice all for others. We see it in our first-responders, we see it in our military and we see it in the faces of everyday people who lined up to give blood, to send supplies, who volunteered to help in anyway possible and who fell to their knees in prayer for the families of people they never even knew. His southern accent was accentuated to add even more vowels to the word for emphasis. When someone is \"real good\" that is not only someone we want to be with, it is someone we can trust. It is someone we know will be constant and true. We can trust Him because He IS good. She was known to be a fire-brand with a stormy temper and no one dared disobey her order! He desires us to trust that He is able to calm the seas of our lives, to quiet the winds of our worlds and to hold us up above the surface of the raging waves. She knew her mother's touch and she rested and slept safe and secure. Perhaps this was why the Daddy in one of our deliveries asked one of our other nurses who I was. Evidently some intervention was needed and Robbie, the patient's nurse, was busy doing what we nurses do at that point in time. I spoke with all the people involved and dealt with the issue. After the patient had recovered, as they were being transferred to their postpartum room, the Daddy asked Robbie for her name and then for my name as he couldn't remember them in all the excitement. Robbie informed him that I was the assistant manager of the unit and he replied that he could sense that from the firmness I had exhibited in the situation. My attitude reflected the authority of my position, but more than that, it represents authority given to me by \"bigger people.\" It reminded me of the episode on The Andy Griffith Show called \"Lawman Barney,\"in which Barney has an issue with two farmers illegally selling produce on the road. As they edge closer towards him in a threatening way, he tells them that despite them both being bigger than he is, his badge \"represents a lot of people that are a lot bigger than either one of you.\" Barney's badge represented the authority of his position. .it represented \"bigger people\". The Lord Jesus Christ is the express image of God...He is the earthly expression of God the Father and God the Spirit. His physical life represents to us more than just Himself, it represents the whole Trinity, the whole character of the Godhead. If we want to know what God the Father is like, we just look at the life of the Lord Jesus Christ. sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;\"\nThis spring my husband grew tomatoes. He watered them. He fed them. When the tomatoes came, he covered the plants with netting to prevent the birds and the squirrels from helping themselves to a meal. If a plant became weighted down with it's fruit, he would make sure it was well staked and supported. If a tomato became split or damaged, he would remove it lest it damage the whole plant. Basically, he was intimately involved with every aspect of those plants. There was not anything the plants needed which was in his power to provide that he did not know about nor provide. He felt responsible for the well-being of those plants and for the crop of tomatoes. In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells us, \"I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman,\" (John 15:1). Jesus is the vine and God the Father is the husbandman. God the Father, as our husbandman, is intimately involved in every aspect of our lives, just as my husband was with those tomatoes. There is not anything we need which He has not already supplied by His own dear Son. We don't have to be concerned with the fruit produced in our lives. If we keep our focus on our True Vine our Husbandman will take care of everything needed to produce fruit. Our focus must be on the Vine because without Him we can do nothing. I wanted to be a journalist, but a well-meaning relative discouraged me. Then I planned to go away to college to become a teacher. There was a perfectly good University in my town which had an excellent College of Education, but instead of enrolling there, out of the blue I told my family, \"I guess I'll go to nursing school.\" I couldn't take Chemistry in summer school, not enough students wanted it to offer it. When he gave out the pretest the first day of class, I looked at the questions and didn't even understand most of the questions! But, through the grace of God, I passed Chemistry. After graduation, I wanted to work in a neonatal intensive care, but there were no slots even in the regular nursery where I was to work. During that time I married, got pregnant and attended childbirth classes. It was during those childbirth classes I fell in love with the concept of labor. Our Lamaze instructor, Nancy, was a wonderful, kind instructor and I wanted to do exactly what she was doing. So after our first baby was born, I went through the rigorous training that group required to become one of their instructors. It has been the most incredible blessing to witness the miracle of birth over and over again -- and each time it is indeed a miracle. What a thought that our Lord and Savior humbled Himself to be born as a baby...what love and mercy bestowed upon us by One willing to become so little and so totally dependent! The first couple of decades seemed to drag along. This is what causes panic to set in, as if the sands in our hourglass are running out and before you know it there will be no more sand! We all remember the Wicked Witch of the West pointing to her hideous hourglass and telling little Dorothy. But if we are Christians, if we have accepted Jesus Christ as our Lord and Savior, our \"hourglass\" contains more sand than all the sands of all the shores and oceans. Yes, these bodies that house our spirits might one day die, if the Lord tarries. But our spirits, which is who and what we really are, will live forever. One day we will simply breathe out the air of this earth and breathe in the sweet fragrance of our Lord. morning a number would come from diuers places to finish the Execution, who failed not at the time: Perries Indian rose out of his bed and reueales it to Pace, that vsed him as a Sonne: And thus the rest of the Colony that had warning giuen them, by this meanes was saued.

Thus they bartered, like idiots, cotton and gold for fragments of bows, glasses, bottles, and jars; which I forbad as being unjust, and myself gave them many beautiful and acceptable articles which I had brought with me, taking nothing from them in return; I did this in order that I might the more easily conciliate them, that they might be led to become Christians, and be inclined to entertain a regard for the King and Queen, our Princes and all Spaniards, and that I might induce them to take an interest in seeking out, and collecting and delivering to us such things as they possessed in abundance, but which we greatly needed.\n—Christopher Columbus: letter to Raphael Sanchez, 1493\nSource 2\nIt was upon these gentle lambs . . . that from the very first day they clapped eyes on them the Spanish fell like ravening wolves upon the fold, or like tigers and savage lions who have not eaten meat for days.

On today’s podcast, Rick Parente, Emeritus Professor at Towson University in Baltimore and a celebrated expert in the field of cognitive retraining will discuss how targeted and specific interventions after a traumatic brain injury are more effective than comprehensive, but non-targeted ones. Because finding ways to help people to learn, remember, and think is as much an art as science, this discussion will lead us all to deploy careful scrutiny when assessing symptom presentation, functional needs, and perceived limitations of the brain. Sucheta, you’re going to lead us off and help us understand why Oliver Sacks is relevant to today’s conversation and also introduce our guest. Sacks had a knack of brining stories of impairment and disorders into the lives of ordinary people who probably had no exposure to anything such as a brain injury or any anomalies to the brain. One of the quotes comes to mind is that he has said that defects, disorders, disease can play a paradoxical role by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence. Until I read Oliver Sacks, I had never known anyone speak so eloquently about neurological diseases, neurological changes, and its profound impact on one’s life. Or particularly, nobody had spoken so clearly about the work that I do. My career is peppered with experiences where I have seen individuals who had skills once, lost them, they had to work on gaining them back. In the process, they have somehow discovered inner transformation and even function at a level when they had never been before or have found a new path. Does one return to original state or does really work on bouncing back to newer states and whatever they may be? One needs some skills to learn to compensate for the lack of skills and to work with people and work on one’s self after the brain injury to remove the obstacles that the brain injury brings. Dr. Parente teaches courses on neuropsychological assessment and neurorehabilitation. Sucheta: Let me get started with this question: how would you describe your own executive function? As a psychologist who works on cognitive retraining, have you benefited from your insights into improving skills and managing self and have you applied them to your own life? Personally, every one of them loses it, ability to organize and the ability to retrieve information from memory rapidly or as rapidly as they used to. By systems, I mean, for example, something as simple as putting everything that you commonly need every day in a bowl next to the front door so you know where it is. The system of doing that, make sure that you don’t lose things. Also, systems for explaining things to people when you talk to them. We have a mnemonic, one of the mnemonics that we use is called the ‘BOMBS’ pneumonic which is explain or say what you want to say right upfront and then omit the details and then mention it again at the end so that you end up talking about the information at the beginning and also at the end of the conversation to capitalize on what the cognitive psychologists call primacy and recency. I think one of the most fascinating executive function that you have and probably you’re extremely skilled at is your insight and your self-awareness. Particularly somebody who is highly published and has co-authored so many books, you wouldn’t do that because that inherently requires organization too. That brings me to this first question regarding the actual work that you do which is: are all injuries to the brain made equal? For example, is concussion and mild traumatic brain injury and traumatic brain injury, do they fall in the same category even though I know the answer but I would love for you to explain this a little bit. For example, I deal to some extent with dementia patients. One of the things I learned years ago from a speech and language therapist whose practice was devoted to dealing with Alzheimer’s patients in Florida told me about what I call personal fact repetition tapes where she would simply get the client and their family to provide 100 facts about the person’s life like what was their name, where did they live, what high school did they go to, what was their first job. And then whenever she saw them, she would have the facts listed 1 through 100 and she would simply go through and say, “What is your name? And she would check them off and they would listen to the facts again and again and again until they could finally recall all 100 facts without any errors. The reason she did that was because with that population on Alzheimer’s patients, a lot of the problems they have are simply resolved from the fact they were embarrassed because they can’t remember things that anyone should be able to remember like their name, for example, or where they live. If I’m dealing with a college student, for example, who’s going to go back to school or make an attempt to go back to school again, then what I’ll do is I’ll try to teach them mnemonics so that they can memorize the information in their textbooks and have an easy way of recalling it and retrieving it. But generally, what happens with people with respect to any type of memory disorder is that they don’t lose access to the information. What they lose is the ability to recall the cue that is necessary to retrieve it and the focus of the therapy resides with teaching the people to formulate reliable and effective cues. It’s very similar to what everybody experiences these days when they put a file on their computer. The file is there and assuming you can get at it, you can retrieve the information and it’ll come right back to you on the screen. But you’re not going to be able to retrieve it unless you have the file name. And what people lose generally in their mind is not the information itself but actually the retrieval cue or the file name. Teaching them to focus on generating those and keeping those available even if it amounts to writing them down is really probably one of the most effective techniques for improving their memory. We hear those words thrown around quite a lot but we don’t find a lot of people who can distinguish them that easily. Regardless of the neuropsychological characteristics that determine it, I think in terms of function, attention is best thought of as essentially your ability to train your senses on something and to apprehend or process what you’re seeing. Whereas concentration on the other hand is more an issue of ability to work with information and memory to, for example, formulate or answers to mathematical problems in your head. That takes concentration. The question always becomes, how much of their memory problem is due to their attention problem and how much of their attention problem dictates other problems like inability to process, for example. It’s a really tough road to hoe because again, every person is different and they all have different attention problems. If a person wanted to improve their attention, then probably that type of computerized activity would be the way to go. When I test kids, for example, their mothers always tell me that, “They can’t pay attention. They can’t pay attention.” But then again, you give that kid a cellphone and they will pay attention to that manual for the cellphone to the point where they can learn to operate it much better than I can. I think probably one of the major aspects with dealing with an attention problem is asking the person, “What are you interested in? What do you like to do?” And you’ll find that they can easily pay attention much, much better if you can isolate some of those activities. Ideally, if it’s a school-related activity, then that works out quite well. I think whenever I’m working with someone with attention problems, my first approach is to say, “First of all, what are you interested in?” And secondly, “Have you tried any medication for this?” If they haven’t tried any medication for it and if they are not – they’ll tell me anything that they’re particularly interested in and we go to some other activity. What are some of those other activities? One question that comes to mind is – this is where I get quite often I see pushback from parents which I’m not really sure if it’s something that they fully understand but particularly if it’s not a brain injury or those with brain injury and a pre-existing diagnosis such as ADHD, there’s a strong kind of personal beliefs that medication – I don’t believe in medication or I don’t want my child to be dependent on medication. There are lots of things that people bring in to that whole decision that there’s a genuine tool available that can have a positive impact on attention but there are a lot of reservations people have. But there will be such a dramatic difference in the person if it does work that is going to be hard for them to continue making that argument. I tell those parents that they better not have their kids wear their glasses either because they don’t want them to become a crutch or they better stop using that microwave, they better stop driving that car, using that washing machine because they’re all crutches in that sense. In addition, coming from me, I think I often find it fascinating that I think – in fact, I just received an email from a colleague of mine who herself is a speech and language pathologist. She wrote to me that, “I felt so guilty by using medication and I felt that I was receiving unfair advantage over my peers. So, I have decided to now wash all my clothes by hand. Sucheta: Let’s talk about cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive retraining. How would you define that and how does that play a role in managing or treating people with brain injury? You’re teaching them, for example, rather than try to remember something, to write it down and keep a written notebook with you so that you can refer to it. What they used to do, they no longer do it that way. What is it used for? Speech and language therapists, I think, are the ones who deserve most of the credit for this type of therapy because they’ve been doing it the longest. For speech and language therapists, the cognitive rehabilitation is usually referred to as teaching a person to communicate better. For the psychiatrists or the psychologists, you’re usually dealing with teaching the person skills or getting along with other people and controlling their emotions. For the occupational therapist, you’re talking about teaching a person functional skills of independent living. And usually for the neuropsychologists, you’re dealing with simply testing the person and seeing what their current levels of function are whether or not there’s been any changes in their functioning. It really is a very different definition, depending upon the discipline that is being addressed. That can be done in any number of different ways and it varies from person to person and person and there is no one conveyor belt type of therapy that can be used with every single person. Well, one of the simplest things you can do for the first example is again to simply get a large bowl and put it in some place where the person comes and goes and says, when you come home, the first thing you do is put everything in that bowl and keep it there and you’ll know where it is. For the second common one, when you go into a room and you can’t remember why you went into that room, the easiest and quickest fix for that is to go back to the room that you just came from because something in that room will again formulate the cue to remind you why you went into the other room. Another, people will tell me, “I can’t remember phone numbers.” I tell them, go to the touchtone phone and key in the phone number 50 times. Don’t even bother to pick up the phone and listen to it but just key in the phone number 50 times. When you can’t remember the phone number, walk up to the phone and soon as your finger gets next to the dial because it’s now on number code, it will bring back the phone number into your memory. What I have in my book at the end of the book in the appendix comes from 27 years of dealing with brain-injured people at the Maryland Rehab Center. And so we took all those suggestions for each of those 50 problems and we came up with one page that listed all the different things that the clients, not us, but the clients said works for them. And when we look at which of those items both the family member and the client endorse as being problematic, then we go to those pages and that’s where we begin. We say, “These are things we’re going to try first.” We come up with literally a little book that’s unique to them and all of those things in that little book are things that are uniquely suited to their individual problems. The first session he came and he brought all his phone bills and he says, “My phone is about to be cut off. I don’t know what I owe them.” Of course, people may not have the imagination to know what it feels like to not be able to look things up on the internet. And then I would come up with some system, feel very relieved and anxious about his success. And so from that, I learned a lot about not really focusing on the patient’s description of that particular day’s problem but really taking some global inventory as you just mentioned. That (1) health patients develop that self-awareness; (2) to help them built a repertoire of compensatory strategies like you mentioned. And the last part of the cognitive retraining rehabilitation, so to speak, is the skill-building process. I can’t emphasize strongly enough that the issue of prosthetic devices, those things really work and they work right away. By prosthetic devices, I mean things that take over the function for the person. With every person I work with, I insist that they set up an automatic bill payment system with the bank to get the bills paid automatically every week without them having to do anything. Things like that save enormous amounts of money with respect to electricity bills. The other thing that I tried to work with all the time with memory is I try to get the people to carry with them a small digital recorder that they can get at the office supply store for about $20. As you can talk 11 times faster than you can write, you can simply make notes to yourself rather than writing them down on a pad and you can review them every minute or every 15-20 minutes, every hour even, and then delete the ones that are no longer relevant. Sucheta: One of the things that I exclusively focus on executive function, I have now my practice where we work with people who are underachieving and their memory functions are not that impaired, their attention skills are not that impaired but their ability to manage the goals of life and one of the problems I run into with them is they have these prosthetic devices, they just don’t have that consistency and processes built into their life or they don’t adhere to those processes which goes back to that motivational component too. But like you mentioned, if you have a digital recorder, you make notes to self and then you need to have a regular time in your day particularly chocked off for reviewing the notes that you have made. That’s where the barrier happens for these people where they don’t review them or they actually did not held the record button carefully enough that they were speaking into the recorder but they’ve never recorded. I can [inaudible 00:29:05] of it certainly specifically with respect to the voice recorder. I find that I have to train the person to use it and it takes a while sometimes to get the person to the point where they do use it. I set it to beep on the hour so that every time the watch beeps, then they listen to all the messages on the recorder. So their cue to listen to the messages is that watch beeping. With respect to them actually using it themselves or being aware of their deficits, that’s a tougher one. And then also, you have to make some judgement as to how important the error is to them. We reduced it down to I think somewhere about 7 or 8 categories. They don’t want to use a voice recorder because they’re comfortable writing things down on a pad. Sucheta: Well, I’ll share with you some of the things I have done in the last 10-12 years with metacognition. In my practice, one of the ways at the end of the – I do something called “glitch analysis.” I have a specialized planner that I have developed. And then predominantly, wherever the glitches tend to be, then we take that category and then doing that meta analysis of what is the mistake, why does this mistake happen, why does this mistake matter, what are the consequences and what are the unseen consequences? Once we have this kind of thing, then they read this summary and I video record them. [inaudible 00:33:00] believes in the notion of lack of awareness as the underlying cause of executive dysfunction. One of the primary premise of this is how do we develop self-awareness and what are the tools and processes that go into developing awareness of self, awareness of strengths and weaknesses, and awareness of strategic thinking by your capacity to evaluate mistakes. In the training process, one of the tools that I have created for every individual, that they make a video addressing the future self. At the beginning of the training, they make a recording and the script is a shell and they fell in the script and the software fills in their own weaknesses and strengths. One of the processes to let them see this video where they have made a promise to their future self. And then the third part about that self-awareness is they are categorically exposed to some game-based training but then they have something called error analysis that they review with a virtual coach. The game that they played based on their performance, they are shown there are 12 types of mistakes and all that stuff. But the idea there, what I was thinking about is, how can I develop understanding of a performance evaluation but how can I take the emotions out of it? Instead of me critiquing me which is very difficult for a lot of our patients as you know, I’m very willing and eager to critique somebody else. When that comes out, let me know because I really want to buy that because I sounds like a great program. So imagine your work that in your book captured work that you had done prior to that. But I feel that the psychologists who study are very focused on evaluation part and then the clinicians who are working are very focused on the treatment part. That continuum, I think there are very few researchers like you who actually connect that two. It’s really, really important to understand the functional aspect of treatment plans and not use those things that feel like that may use – do you mind telling us a little bit about what are the things that don’t work when it comes to therapy? Rick: Well, one of the things that I think doesn’t work is perhaps the most commonly used therapeutic treatment which is stimulation therapy, where people sit in front of a computer and they try to remember lists of words or number strings or try to match things on the screen. I guess there’s some value to it but there’s really no evidence whatsoever that it actually has any carryover to the real world. You can talk about carryover globally but there’s actually a dichotomy of carryover, one of which is generalization, meaning that what you’re learning is actually you’re able to apply it in any number of different novel situations. And the other one is transfer, meaning that what you are learning carries over to the real world in exactly the same way that you learned it when you were training. But there’s very little evidence of generalization. There’s a book by Singley and Anderson called ‘The Transfer of Cognitive Skill’ that was devoted to that entire issue of if you’d look at different ways of measuring transfer and generalization and real-world context, you’ll be hard-pressed to find people who can generalize quite people but you’ll have no difficulty finding people who can transfer. If the goal is to teach generalization, you’re probably wasting your time. There’s very little evidence that they carry over into any aspect of the person’s everyday life. Another thing that doesn’t really seem to work very well is Freudian psychotherapy, teaching or trying to get the person to understand their relationship with their mother when they were 3 years old probably is not going to have much of an effect on their life right now because they don’t have the executive functioning, the metacognitive skills to see how those things relate at all. And there’s other things but I think the two are areas that I think are the squeakiest wheels, put it that way, what does work well, one thing I found myself is that with the mildly brain-injured people, if they simply go back to a community college and take a non-credit course, where you don’t have to take tests or get grades, I see much more improvement in them in one semester than I see incomparable people going through all these very expensive therapies. And if you take away the evaluation component of it, they’re usually not so wary about doing it. And also, work is a good therapeutic modality. There’s again, something about being in that social environment, something about being in that context where they have to think all the time and make decisions that makes a big improvement in their cognition in a very short period of time. It has direct carryover and transfer to the real world. There’s also, I think, the whole idea of socialization training, teaching a person how to behave in certain situations. At the rehab center, when we did a five-year follow up which people got jobs and which people stayed employed the longest, the single best predictor of those two variables was whether or not they had psychosocial group training. Get them a [inaudible 00:40:53] or something like that. But I would certainly give them that type of training because socialization is terribly important in their ability to get along with other people and to reintegrate themselves into a social environment and not end up in their home watching cartoons and afraid to go out into the real world. Sucheta: Well, I think you nailed it that socializing is literally having to adapt and adjust to the presentations of others as well as having to pay attention to the non-verbal as well as verbal content having to read minds of others, having to consider context and recognize social relevance of information. In my practice, for those clients who don’t have the skills ready, I worked, for example, with a gentleman who worked at CNN in a very high position and he was in a motorbike accident and he was not able to go back. We just did some mock – we created mock situations where he would have that opportunity through volunteer work. A lot of times, the barrier is not just cognitive barrier but it is also some of the social psychological barrier where the person who’s endured the brain injury has a tremendous shock regarding poor skills and sometimes those barriers are greater than the actual impairment that comes about because of the cognitive changes. The thing that I try to impress upon them is that even though they can’t do the job they used to do or they can’t do what they used to do – and again, these are the fairly high functioning people who were in good jobs or had families and pretty much a normal life. Unless you have some type of benchmark there. They end up in this cyclical loop where they’re always trying to achieve something that they thought they were before but there’s really no way of knowing how accurate their impression of what they were like before is. So consequently, they can never really get back to that state. I try to teach them that we have to establish concrete benchmarks, not so much look in the past and see what you were before but look to the future and say, “Where do you want to be? Where do you want to be in five years?

However, the 1815 bill was extremely ambitious and the dates at which subsequent factory legislation matched its provisions (paid inspectors 1833 Act; ten-hour day 1847 Act, minimum age ten 1874 Act) do not suggest that if passed it would have been regarded as a definitive settlement. Objections to the much weaker 1819 bill were still strong and varied; a contemporary pro-bill pamphlet listed (and to its own satisfaction rebutted) eight different arguments against the bill, most of which were to continue to be urged against subsequent factory legislation for many years:\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

However, the existence of such decadence has been disputed, because in 366 Florence was the capital of a vast province and united Tuscany and Umbria, due to the administrative reform by Diocletian and, until 315, it has been the seat of a bishop.

MacKaye conceived human beings—and sentient beings generally—as mechanisms of transforming resources into happiness, which he argued was the only intrinsic good. The goal of a society was therefore viewed by MacKaye as the problem of finding that arrangement which would produce the highest output of happiness attainable given the inputs available. As he wrote, \"That which society should seek to attain, the maximum surplus of happiness, may be referred to by different names according to the relation in which we think of it, \n\nThe healthcare reform debate in the United States has been a political issue focusing upon increasing medical coverage, decreasing costs, insurance reform, and the philosophy of its provision, funding, and government involvement. He endorsed a seven-point plan for healthcare reform:\n\n repeal Obamacare\n reduce barriers to the interstate sale of health insurance\n institute a full tax deduction for insurance premium payments for individuals\n make Health Saving Accounts inheritable\n require price transparency\n block-grant Medicaid to the states\n allow for more overseas drug providers through lowered regulatory barriers\n\nHe also suggested that enforcing immigration laws could reduce healthcare costs. However, as the Supreme Court subsequently went on hiatus in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it is unclear when the case will be heard. For scale, a 5% GDP difference represents about $1 trillion or $3,000 per person. Some of the many reasons cited for the cost differential with other countries include: Higher administrative costs of a private system with multiple payment processes; higher costs for the same products and services; more expensive volume/mix of services with higher usage of more expensive specialists; aggressive treatment of very sick elderly versus palliative care; less use of government intervention in pricing; and higher income levels driving greater demand for healthcare. Some critics of reform counter that almost four out of ten of these uninsured come from a household with over $50,000 income per year, and thus might be uninsured voluntarily, or opting to pay for health care services on a \"pay-as-you-go\" basis. Further, an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers are reaching retirement age, which combined with significant annual increases in healthcare costs per person will place enormous budgetary strain on U.S. state and federal governments. Physicians for a National Health Program, a political advocacy group, has claimed that a free market solution to healthcare provides a lower quality of care, with higher mortality rates, than publicly funded systems. According to a 2015 report from The Commonwealth Fund, although the United States pays almost twice as much per capita towards healthcare as other wealthy countries with universal healthcare, patient outcomes are poorer. The United States has the lowest life expectancy overall and the infant mortality rate is the highest and in some cases twice as high when compared with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries. According to a 2000 study of the World Health Organization (WHO), publicly funded systems of industrial nations spend less on healthcare, both as a percentage of their GDP and per capita, and enjoy superior population-based health care outcomes. However, conservative commentator David Gratzer and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, have both criticized the WHO's comparison method for being biased; the WHO study marked down countries for having private or fee-paying health treatment and rated countries by comparison to their expected healthcare performance, rather than objectively comparing quality of care. There was no correlation. A 2007 article from The BMJ by Steffie Woolhandler and David Himmelstein strongly argued that the United States' healthcare model delivered inferior care at inflated prices, and further stated: \"The poor performance of US health care is directly attributable to reliance on market mechanisms and for-profit firms and should warn other nations from this path.\" Proponents of healthcare reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal healthcare argue that the need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends to drive up costs, leading to more expensive provision. According to economist and former US Secretary of Labor, Robert Reich, only a \"big, national, public option\" can force insurance companies to cooperate, share information, and reduce costs. Impact on U.S. economic productivity\nOn March 1, 2010, billionaire Warren Buffett said that the high costs paid by U.S. companies for their employees’ healthcare put them at a competitive disadvantage. He compared the roughly 17% of GDP spent by the U.S. on healthcare with the 9% of GDP spent by much of the rest of the world, noted that the U.S. has fewer doctors and nurses per person, and said, “that kind of a cost, compared with the rest of the world, is like a tapeworm eating at our economic body.”\n\nAllegations of waste\n\nIn December 2011 the outgoing Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Dr. Donald Berwick, asserted that 20% to 30% of healthcare spending is waste. He listed five causes for the waste: (1) overtreatment of patients, (2) the failure to coordinate care, (3) the administrative complexity of the system, (4) burdensome rules and (5) fraud. He mentioned electronic record-keeping, preventing expensive conditions, reducing obesity, refocusing doctor incentives from quantity of care to quality, bundling payments for treatment of conditions rather than specific services, better identifying and communicating the most cost-effective treatments, and reducing defensive medicine. His plan mentions: deficit neutrality; not allowing insurance companies to discriminate based on pre-existing conditions; capping out of pocket expenses; creation of an insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses; tax credits for individuals and small companies; independent commissions to identify fraud, waste and abuse; and malpractice reform projects, among other topics. OMB Director Peter Orszag described aspects of the Obama administration's strategy during an interview in November 2009: \"In order to help contain [Medicare and Medicaid] cost growth over the long term, we need a new healthcare system that has digitized information... in which that information is used to assess what’s working and what’s not more intelligently, and in which we’re paying for quality rather than quantity while also encouraging prevention and wellness.\" He also argued for bundling payments and accountable care organizations, which reward doctors for teamwork and patient outcomes. He argued that the U.S. has an opportunity to redesign its healthcare system and that there is a wide consensus that reform is necessary. He articulated four \"pillars\" of such a strategy:\n Focus on value, which he defined as the ratio of quality of service provided relative to cost;\n Pay for and align incentives with value;\n Cover everyone;\n Establish mechanisms for improving the healthcare service delivery system over the long-term, which is the primary means through which value would be improved. Writing in The New Yorker, surgeon Atul Gawande further distinguished between the delivery system, which refers to how medical services are provided to patients, and the payment system, which refers to how payments for services are processed. He argued that reform of the delivery system is critical to getting costs under control, but that payment system reform (e.g., whether the government or private insurers process payments) is considerably less important yet gathers a disproportionate share of attention. Gawande argued that dramatic improvements and savings in the delivery system will take \"at least a decade.\" He argued this would be an iterative, empirical process and should be administered by a \"national institute for healthcare delivery\" to analyze and communicate improvement opportunities. Use of comparative effectiveness research\n\nSeveral treatment alternatives may be available for a given medical condition, with significantly different costs yet no statistical difference in outcome. Such scenarios offer the opportunity to maintain or improve the quality of care, while significantly reducing costs, through comparative effectiveness research. Reform of doctor's incentives\nCritics have argued that the healthcare system has several incentives that drive costly behavior. Two of these include:\n Doctors are typically paid for services provided rather than with a salary. Insurance reforms\nThe debate has involved certain insurance industry practices such as the placing of caps on coverage, the high level of co-pays even for essential services such as preventative procedures, the refusal of many insurers to cover pre-existing conditions or adding premium loading for these conditions, and practices which some people regard as egregious such as the additional loading of premiums for women, the regarding of having previously been assaulted by a partner as having a pre-existing condition, and even the cancellation of insurance policies on very flimsy grounds when a claimant who had paid in many premiums presents with a potentially expensive medical condition. The legislation also taxes certain very high payout insurance policies (so-called \"Cadillac policies\") to help finance subsidies for poorer citizens. These will be offered on a sliding scale to people earning less than four times the federal poverty level to enable them to buy health insurance if they are not otherwise covered by their employer. The issue of concentration of power by the insurance industry has also been a focus of debate as in many states very few large insurers dominate the market. The five largest carriers in the small group market, when combined, represented three quarters or more of the market in 34 of the 39 states supplying this information, and they represented 90% or more in 23 of these states....the median market share of all the BCBS carriers in 38 states reporting this information in 2008 was about 51%, compared to the 44% reported in 2005 and the 34% reported in 2002 for the 34 states supplying information in each of these years.\" Tax reform\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office has also described how the tax treatment of insurance premiums may affect behavior:\n\nIn November 2009, The Economist estimated that taxing employer-provided health insurance (which is presently exempt from tax) would add $215 billion per year to federal tax revenue during the 2013–2014 periods. Peter Singer wrote in The New York Times that the current exclusion of insurance premiums from compensation represents a $200 billion subsidy for the private insurance industry and that it would likely not exist without it. In other words, taxpayers might be more inclined to change behavior or the system itself if they were paying $200 billion more in taxes each year related to health insurance. Comparative effectiveness research would be one of many tools used by the IMAC. Rationing of care\nHealthcare rationing may refer to the restriction of medical care service delivery based on any number of objective or subjective criteria. Republican Newt Gingrich argued that the reform plans supported by President Obama expand the control of government over healthcare decisions, which he referred to as a type of healthcare rationing. President Obama has argued that U.S. healthcare is already rationed, based on income, type of employment, and medical pre-existing conditions, with nearly 46 million uninsured. He argued that millions of Americans are denied coverage or face higher premiums as a result of medical pre-existing conditions. Peter Singer wrote in the New York Times in July 2009 that healthcare is rationed in the United States and argued for improved rationing processes:\n\nAccording to PolitiFact, private health insurance companies already ration healthcare by income, by denying health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions and by caps on health insurance payments. David Leonhardt also wrote in the New York Times in June 2009 that rationing is a part of economic reality: \"The choice isn’t between rationing and not rationing. It’s between rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United States devotes far more of its economy to healthcare than other rich countries, and gets worse results by many measures, it’s hard to argue that we are now rationing very rationally.\" During 2009, former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin wrote against alleged rationing, referring to what by her interpretation was a \"downright evil\" \"death panel\" in current reform legislation known as H.R. However, Palin supported similar end of life discussion and advance directives for patients in 2008. Patients could seek out such advice on their own, but would not be required to. Analysts who examined the end-of-life provision Palin cited agree that Palin's claim is incorrect. According to TIME and ABC, Palin and Betsy McCaughey made false euthanasia claims. The federal requirement that hospitals help patients with things like living wills began when Republican George H. W. Bush was President. Slate columnist Christopher Beam used the term \"deathers\" to refer to those who believed rationing and euthanasia would become likely for senior citizens. Daily Kos and other web sites had used the term for about a week before Hari Sevugan, national spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, sent out an email with the subject line \"Murkowski: Deathers 'Lying' 'Inciting Fear.'\" Sevugan explained the term \"deathers\" to Patricia Murphy, who used to write a Politics Daily column called \"The Capitolist\":\n\nBy \"deather,\" I mean an opponent of change who is knowingly spreading false information regarding the existence of an alleged \"death panel\" in health insurance reform plans despite the fact the claim has been repeatedly and unequivocally debunked by independent fact-checking organizations. Like \"birthers\", \"deathers\" are shamefully lying and trafficking in scurrilous rumors to incite fear and achieve their stated political objective of derailing the president of the United States. Others, such as former Republican Secretary of Commerce Peter G. Peterson, have indicated that some form of rationing is inevitable and desirable considering the state of U.S. finances and the trillions of dollars of unfunded Medicare liabilities. He estimated that 25–33% of healthcare services are provided to those in the last months or year of life and advocated restrictions in cases where quality of life cannot be improved. Physician and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean explained why tort reform is not part of the bills under consideration: \"When you go to pass a really enormous bill like that, the more stuff you put it in it, the more enemies you make, right?...And the reason tort reform is not on the bill is because the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on. However, even successful tort reform might not lead to lower aggregate liability: for example, medical commentators have argued that the current contingent fee system skews litigation towards high-value cases while ignoring meritorious small cases; aligning litigation more closely with merit might thus increase the number of small awards, offsetting any reduction in large awards. Addressing the shortage of doctors, nurses and hospital capacity\nThe U.S. is facing shortages of doctors and nurses that are projected to grow worse as America ages, which may drive up the price of these services. The American Academy of Family Physicians predicts a shortage of 40,000 primary care doctors (including family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology) by 2020. An amendment to the Senate health bill includes $2 billion in funds over 10 years to create 2,000 new residency training slots geared toward primary care medicine and general surgery. Writing in Forbes, a physician argued that this is a \"tiny band-aid at best,\" advocating full loan repayments and guaranteed positions upon graduation. The U.S. had 2.4 doctors per 1,000 people in 2002, ranking 52nd. Germany and France had approximately 3.4 and ranked in the top 25. The OECD average in 2008 was 3.1 doctors per 1,000 people, while the U.S. had 2.4. Only four OECD countries have fewer acute care hospital beds per capita than the U.S, which has 2.7 per 1,000 population versus an OECD average of 3.8. Economist Paul Krugman estimated in 2005 that converting from the current private insurance system to a single-payer system would save $200 billion per year, primarily via insurance company overhead. Advocates argue that shifting the U.S. to a single-payer health care system would provide universal coverage, give patients free choice of providers and hospitals, and guarantee comprehensive coverage and equal access for all medically necessary procedures, without increasing overall spending. The American Medical Association argued that the single-payer system would be burdened by longer wait times, would be inefficient when it comes to medical innovation and facility maintenance, and a large bureaucracy could \"cause a decline in the authority of patients and their physicians over clinical decision-making.\" Advocates argue that the largest obstacle to single-payer, universal system in the U.S. is a lack of political will. The Congressional Budget Office said that it would not reduce the percentage of working age people who do not have insurance over the next 10 years, and that it estimated it would encourage health insurers to reduce rather than increase insurance coverage as it would remove mandated coverage rules that currently apply in some states. It did not have any taxation provisions and though it would reduce the deficit over 10 years by $18 billion, this was a considerably smaller deficit reduction than either the House or the Senate bills. In particular, both bills:\n Mandate minimum health insurance benefits for most Americans\n Remove insurer set annual and lifetime caps on coverage and limit co-pay amounts\n Remove co-pays on certain services such as health screenings and some vaccinations\n Impose a new excise tax on medical devices and drugs, including vaccines (the federal government began taxing vaccines in 1987). Establish health insurance exchanges making easier price and coverage comparisons and purchasing for people and small businesses buying health care coverage\n Prevent insurers selling in the exchange insurance policies that do not meet minimum coverage standards\n Prevent insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions\n Prevent sex discrimination by insurers (especially the current discrimination against women) in setting premiums\n Limit age discrimination by insurers when setting policy premiums\n Restrict the ability of insurers to rescind policies they have been collecting premiums on\n Require insurers to cover adult children up to their mid twenties as part of family coverage\n Expand Medicaid eligibility up the income ladder (to 133% of the poverty line in the Senate bill and 150% in the House bill)\n Offer tax credits to certain small businesses (under 25 workers) who provide employees with health insurance\n Impose a penalty on employers who do not offer health insurance to their workers\n Impose a penalty on individuals who do not have health insurance (except American Indians (currently covered by the Indian Health Service), people with religious objections and people who can show financial hardship)\n Provide health insurance assistance subsidies for those earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level that must buy insurance for themselves\n Offer a new voluntary long-term care insurance program\n Pay for new spending, in part, through cutting over-generous funding (under existing law) given to private insurers that sell privatised health care plans to seniors (so called Medicare Advantage plans), slowing the growth of Medicare provider payments , reducing Medicare and Medicaid drug prices , cutting other Medicare and Medicaid spending through better reward structures, and raising taxes on very generous health care packages (typically offered to senior executives) and penalties on larger firms not providing their employees with health care coverage and certain persons who do not buy health insurance. Impose a $2,500 limit on contributions to a flexible spending account (FSAs), pre-tax health benefits, to pay for health care reform costs. Most economists believe the excise tax to be best of the three revenue raisers above, since (due to health care cost growth) it would grow fast enough to more than keep up with new coverage costs, and it would help to put downward pressure on overall health care cost growth. The House and Senate bills would mandate the purchase of policies that pay 100% of the cost of certain services, with no co-pay; when the Senate bill was amended to mandate paying for tests that a federal panel and U.S. News & World Report said \"do more harm than good,\" The New York Times wrote, \"This sorry episode does not bode well for reform efforts to rein in spending on other procedures based on sound scientific evidence of their potential benefits and risks for patients.\" The federal poverty level is related to a determined percentage that defines how much of that family's income can be put towards a health insurance premium. To understand how each bill can affect different poverty levels and incomes, see the Kaiser Family Foundation's subsidy calculator\n\nSubsidies Under House Bill\n\nThe House plan subsidizes the cost of the plan and out-of-pocket expenses. For example, both institute a public long-term care insurance known as the CLASS Act – because this insurance has a 5-year vesting period, it will appear to raise revenue in the first decade, even though all the money will need to be paid back. If the CLASS Act is subtracted from the bills, the Senate bill would reduce the deficit by $57 billion over ten years, and the House by $37 billion. In addition to the CLASS Act, neither bill accounts for the costs of updating Medicare physician payments, even though the House did so on a deficit-financed basis shortly after passing their health care bill. He argued that a trial and error strategy, combined with industry and government partnership, is how the U.S. overcame a similar challenge in the agriculture industry in the early 20th century. It's a mistake for one politician to judge the personal motives of another. But Sens. Debate about political organizing methods\nMuch of the coverage of the debate has involved how the different sides are competing to express their views, rather than the specific reform proposals. Supporters of a greater government role in healthcare, such as former insurance PR executive Wendell Potter of the Center for Media and Democracy- whose funding comes from groups such as the Tides Foundation- argue that the hyperbole generated by this phenomenon is a form of corporate astroturfing, which he says that he used to write for CIGNA. Opponents of more government involvement, such as Phil Kerpen of Americans for Prosperity- whose funding comes mainly from the Koch Industries corporation- counter-argue that those corporations oppose a public-plan, but some try to push for government actions that will unfairly benefit them, such as forcing private companies to buy health insurance for their employees. Journalist Ben Smith has referred to mid-2009 as \"The Summer of Astroturf\" given the organizing and co-ordinating efforts made by various groups on both pro- and anti-reform sides. Arguments concerning health care reform\n\nLiberal arguments\nSome have argued that health care is a fundamental human right. Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states: \"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services.\" Similarly, Franklin D. Roosevelt advocated a right to medical care in his 1944 proposal for a Second Bill of Rights. Liberals were the primary advocates of both Social Security and Medicare, which are often targeted as significant expansions of government that has overwhelming satisfaction among beneficiaries. President Obama argued during a September 2009 joint session of Congress that the government has a moral responsibility to ensure quality healthcare is available to all citizens. Economist and New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has argued that Republican and conservative strategies in opposing healthcare are based on spite: \"At this point, the guiding principle of one of our nation’s two great political parties is spite pure and simple. If Republicans think something might be good for the president, they’re against it – whether or not it’s good for America.\" First of all, the modern G.O.P. considers itself the party of Ronald Reagan – and Reagan was a fierce opponent of Medicare’s creation, warning that it would destroy American freedom. Conservative and libertarian arguments\nConservative and libertarian arguments against a government role in healthcare emerged in the 1910s, as public concern was growing about the problems of health care access and high medical costs. President Truman, who was a strong supporter of the Wagner-Murray-Dingell Bill which would instate a national medical insurance program financed by taxes, was elected in the late 1940s and the AMA spent over $1 million on an anti-health reform campaign, denouncing the bill and fueled even more by cold war rhetoric of socialism. As illustrated by these tensions, Cold war propaganda and socialism was so central in the debates of healthcare that ideas of health insurance and accessibility became inextricable from politics. Much of the conservative rhetoric throughout US history has centered on Cold War propaganda and neoliberal economic ideology. Such rhetoric shows up even in the language used by the American Medical Association (AMA) which has described universal healthcare policies as “socialized medicine”. The AMA and many physicians actively held political roles that opposed many grassroots movements for compulsory health insurance, due to their private/ profit incentives as well as antipathy toward “socialism”. The republican President Reagan spoke out against Socialized Medicine, in which he “criticized Social Security for supplanting private savings and warned that subsidized medicine would curtail Americans' freedom\" and that \"pretty soon your son will not decide when he is in school, where he will go or what he will do for a living\". For example, Conservative GOP columnist Bill Kristol advocated several free-market reforms instead of the Clinton plan during the 1993–1994 period. Republican Senator and medical doctor Tom Coburn has stated that the healthcare system in Switzerland should serve as a model for U.S. reform. He wrote for New York Sun that reform should involve a market-based method transferring health care tax benefits to individuals rather than employers as well as giving individuals extra tax credits to afford more coverage. FactCheck called the phrase an unjustified \"mantra.\" President Obama disputes the notion of a government takeover and says he no more wants government bureaucrats meddling than he wants insurance company bureaucrats doing so. This debate occurs in the context of a \"revolution...transforming how medical care is delivered:\" from 2002 to 2008, the percentage of medical practices owned by doctors fell from more than 70% to below 50%; in contrast to the traditional practice in which most doctors cared for patients in small, privately owned clinics, by 2008 most doctors had become employees of hospitals, nearly all of which are owned by corporations or government. Republicans also argue the proposed excise tax on medical devices and drugs would increase the tax burden on vaccine makers. And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when nobody else is willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model.\" Health policy\n Health economics\n Health insurance cooperative\n History of health care reform in the United States\n List of healthcare reform advocacy groups in the United States\n Public opinion on health care reform in the United States\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n PBS Special Report:Healthcare Reform NOW on PBS\n \n Malhotra, Umang, Solving the American Healthcare Crisis, iUniverse, 2010.

Nor is there any reason why the state should not help to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance in providing for those common hazards of life against which few can make adequate provision.\" He concludes: \"In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing.\" regulations that restrict legal methods of production, so long as these are applied equally to everyone and not used as an indirect way of controlling prices or quantities, and without forgetting the cost of such restrictions: \"To prohibit the use of certain poisonous substances, or to require special precautions in their use, to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements, is fully compatible with the preservation of competition.

Among other arguments, the defenders of the ecclesiastical states insisted that it was fundamentally illegal and unconstitutional to dissolve any imperial estates, and that the notion of compensating rulers for lost territory was contrary to all past treaties, where \"each had to bear his own fate\". They contended that even if circumstances now made it necessary, the amount of compensation should \n\n 107 of the 1844 Constitution and article 111 of the 1911 Constitution- \"Ἡ τήρησις τοῦ παρόντος Συντάγματος ἀφιεροῦται εἰς τὸν πατριωτισμὸν τῶν Ἑλλήνων\" translated as \"Observance of the  constitution hereof is  dedicated to  the  patriotism  of  the  Greeks\" alongside \"the right and the duty to resist by all possible means\" any violent attempt to abolish the Constitution. Paragraph 4 does not, in any way, stipulate ownership of firearms, or apply in the cases of contravention of articles of the constitution, cession of national sovereignty (e.g. accession to the European Union) or a state of siege (pursuant to Article 48 of the Constitution). As such, it is to be considered active in cases when institutional bodies (such as the Parliament) are unable to function properly and monitor the observance of the Constitution, like that of a coup d'état or foreign occupation. opposed to the ideas or claims that it is seeking to promote. The participants must, however, be able to hold the demonstration without having to fear that they will be subjected to physical violence by their opponents; such a fear would be liable to deter associations or other groups supporting common ideas or interests from openly expressing their opinions on highly controversial issues affecting the community. In a democracy the right to counter-demonstrate cannot extend to inhibiting the exercise of the right to demonstrate. Genuine, effective freedom of peaceful assembly cannot, therefore, be reduced to a mere duty on the part of the State not to interfere: a purely negative conception would not be compatible with the object and purpose of Article 11. The Bremen clause (Bremer Klausel) is Article 141 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, which states: Artikel 7 Abs. Januar 1949 eine andere landesrechtliche Regelung bestand. The sentence cited provides: Der Religionsunterricht ist in den öffentlichen Schulen mit Ausnahme der bekenntnisfreien Schulen ordentliches Lehrfach. It limits the range of application of the constitutional (Basic Law) rule over religious education, making it possible to have other types of instruction in some areas of Germany. It is not religious education in the sense of the Basic Law, because its content is not accountable to a religious community; therefore it is not a \"common affair\" (res mixta).

Their escape was the only successful one in the history of New Caledonia as a French penal colony, and made headlines in France, as well as being the subject of a Manet painting. Pain quickly got back into contact with the French Press, and in 1877 he was dispatched to report on the Russo-Turkish War for La Lanterne.

As a distinguished writer sympathizing with the cause of communism, he was invited to speak at Maxim Gorky's funeral and to tour the Soviet Union as a guest of the Soviet Union of Writers. He encountered censorship of his speeches and was particularly disillusioned with the state of culture under Soviet communism, breaking with his socialist friends  in Retour de L'U.R.S.S. \"Then would it not be better to, instead of playing on words, simply to acknowledge that the revolutionary spirit (or even simply the critical spirit) is no longer the correct thing, that it \n\n newspaper Le Conservateur et le Gers réunis wrote in 1876 that the Bonapartist Cassagnac family preached \"the people's rights to wealth, which is pure socialism ... these two men, father and son, who presume to subject the department of Gers to their doctrines, their complots, and their low intrigues.\" The editor of the Bonapartist newspaper L'appel au peuple in Gers wrote, \"With the &#91;Bourbon] white flag you have the return of the old privileges; you have the suppression of universal suffrage; you will go back to the epoch when the very rich and noble alone had the right to participate in public affairs, in a word, had alone the right to vote.\"\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school european history.

He had renounced his rank and his fortune; he had gone among workmen, only in the hope of seeing at last the foundation of a new society of labour in common. All the sous in his pockets had long gone to the urchins of the settlement; he had been as tender as a brother with the colliers, smiling at their suspicion, winning them over by his quiet workmanlike ways and his dislike of chattering.

In 1815, Robert Owen, owner of a prosperous mill at New Lanark approached Peel with a draft Bill to regulate the use of children in the textile industry. Owen's draft was given a First Reading late in the 1815 session (so that copies could be printed and sent out for consultation before the 1816 session; other bills were given similar 'advance notice' First Readings at the end of the 1815 session). In the 1816 session Peel chaired a Commons Committee collecting \n\n British United Shoe Machinery Co, and the business directed its efforts more towards printing, grinding, and knitwear machines.
