        "context": " Commenting on populism in Latin America, Paul Drake described what he called ‘bait-and-switch’ strategies, in which candidates engage in a redistributive discourse in order to attract the support of the poor, only later to apply neoliberal structural adjustment policies. It is possible that these ‘bait-and-switchers,’ as Drake called them, would actually prefer to implement their favored redistributive policies, but were forced by constraints deriving from market imperatives to implement orthodox policies. Kenneth Roberts proposed the bait-and-switch argument as one of the core characteristics of a new kind of Latin American populism (broad-based and supported by the lower classes, but implementing market-driven policies) of \n\n the popular narrative that the rise of national-populist movements seen across much of the Western world is due largely to \"angry old white men\" who would soon be demographically displaced by younger and more liberal voters is flawed. Sinistrisme is a neologism invented by political scientist Albert Thibaudet in Les idées politiques de la France (1932) to explain the evolution and recombination of party systems in France without substantial changes occurring to party ideology. Thibaudet saw that, over time, issues that previously had not been politicised would emerge, drawing public concern and stimulating a demand for political action. A new political movement would form to champion the new concerns, and this would send repercussions throughout the existing political system. Ball denounced Dewey for making his position on foreign policy so unclear that both isolationists and internationalists \"could find comfort and support in what he said\".\n\n"
