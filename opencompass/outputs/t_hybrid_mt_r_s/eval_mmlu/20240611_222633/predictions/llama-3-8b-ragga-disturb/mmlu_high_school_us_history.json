The official name is Neonatal Comfort Care Program and it’s a service of perinatal and neonatal palliative care, so our team takes care of babies before and after birth. As a neonatologist I like to give a plan of care to parents expecting a baby with problems, I can explain the medical care we will provide in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) or which surgical procedure will solve the baby’s problems, but in these cases, what could I offer? Life-limiting conditions are not amenable of medical or surgical care, these babies cannot be healed, so parents are given the option to terminate the pregnancy. However, there is a significant number of parents who want to continue the pregnancy, desire to see their babies, to hold them and enjoy as much as possible their brief but precious lives. And I should be able to address desires and expectations of their families.” My first case was a little girl with Trisomy 18 who lived for two weeks. I took care of her every day, making sure she could spend time with her family and be comfortable. We did not even realize the exact moment when it happened, she was so comfortable and peaceful. The hospital welcomed us and is very happy and proud of our program, but we receive no financial support from them. Therefore, our program is running because of the generosity of donors. Just to give you an idea, in 2008 I followed thirteen families, while in 2017, more than 100. Some babies were born in other institutions in U.S., or even internationally; for instance, I followed a family via Skype in Dubai, and a number of families in Italy. So, is a lot of the work about talking to the families? These families come to us asking for help. There are so many issues. How many times do you see pregnant women in the checkout line and even if you don’t know them, you’ll congratulate them and ask them about the baby’s gender? These families need to learn how to communicate this not only with those outside the family, but even in the family: how to tell the other siblings without crushing their hearts, how to tell your own parents, or figuring out who you want to tell. There is a lot of emotional and psychological support needed, and this is more about what my team does. My main job as a doctor is preparing a plan which allows families to have a special protected time to fully enjoy motherhood and fatherhood. So, their life will be short but, for them, it will be a beautiful experience of love and welcoming.” Depending on the family’s background—religious, social, racial, etc.—we try to craft a plan that follows the medical and non-medical needs of each baby. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. Fathers especially are very worried about facing the moment of birth followed by death. We really make a point to emphasize that, yes, it’s going to be excruciating pain and that’s why we will be with them, but we promise that it’s also going to be a celebration of joy and honoring life. They send us cards year after year, perhaps with pictures of other babies born after that one, but always remembering the baby with the short life as someone very special. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. Our proposal is to have baby/family bonding in a private space, so the busy NICU is not a proper place. Ideally these babies should be with mom and family in post-partum, however, the nurses in post-partum are used to taking care only of mothers and healthy babies. Well, we have been offering a big deal of education, and after ten years we succeeded in obtaining a significant culture change: In our institution, no baby with life-limiting condition comes to the NICU, but they all follow mom in post-partum. This setting is unique, so much so that we have families coming from very far to deliver in our hospital. Doctors and even administrators also appreciate this program because, first of all, there is family satisfaction, and these babies also don’t take up beds in the NICU, so there’s no need to fight for beds or to occupy beds that could be occupied by babies who can be saved, as there’s no need for these babies to be isolated in the NICU. Is a program like this unusual? These are centers where there are obstetricians who follow and support women expecting babies with life-limiting conditions. What is really special here is that our team is involved at the moment of prenatal diagnosis, during delivery welcoming the baby and seeing what medical needs the baby has, following the baby afterwards, and following the family long-term for years. What makes us different is the continuity of care which includes the care of mom, baby, and family. What has it been like for you to work on this? I want babies to live and have a happy life. I never thought about palliative care as something that would interest me because I want babies to live, obviously. This kind of approach became my love because, again, I want to save babies’ lives, but to save their lives is to save whatever life they’re supposed to have. I need to stay with them, where they are, whether they have a long or a short life. If my medical knowledge and experience cannot heal their illness and make them healthy, I need to stay with them up to very last moment. It’s a very rewarding experience because I can satisfy their needs all throughout their life and also support their parents in a situation which seems impossible to face. In fact, how can you face your child dying in your arms? From a professional point of view this innovative program is also satisfying. But it is also satisfying to me because it is an answer to a need that I had. My first story is about a single mother in her early forties. This mom was offered the option to terminate the pregnancy, but she said, “No. I would like to see him, to hold him, to kiss him, and to protect his life up to the very end.” So, I met her with my team, we gave her our proposal, and made a plan. Yes, there is life before death and she was fully living her motherhood. I have a second story. But her parents are very proud of her because, in a sense, her body took care of herself. We don’t condemn anybody to death. It is about Siamese twins. They refused, however, saying simply, “These are our babies.” So, they opted to carry the babies to term. Many people were commenting that the woman should have terminated the pregnancy. The people were the same, and yet they were completely changed. The fact that everybody was changed, that everybody was moved, bears witness to this, and it is further evidence that we all share the same heart despite differing ideologies or preconceptions. In this time of tension between the pro-choice and the pro-life movements, both sides at times seems to feel ideological. Your project, instead, seems to affirm life without being ideological. Absolutely. That’s why we propose our option to families who receive a bad diagnosis during pregnancy and are open with us, but we are open to the fact that occasionally there are families who, after meeting us, decide otherwise. We propose that it is possible to be parents and hold your baby in your arms even if his or her life is very brief. This is a choice that allows one to fully experience motherhood and fatherhood. That’s why, after we offer our proposal, the vast majority of families we meet follows us. I am convinced that each mother and father has an irrevocable, original, and fundamental desire to support life and to love their babies as much as they can. Our proposal is meant to support this irrevocable desire and we are available to anyone who would like to follow our plan. Everything else is ideological and I have no interest in discussing it. In fact, what is unique in our program is that we always put ourselves in the babies’ shoes. While we keep in mind each family’s desires and expectations, we are about what the baby needs to feel, what the baby needs to hear, and so the program is very much baby-oriented because those are my champions. We also understand that we can’t possibly take care of all babies in need of our help and, in reality, our vision is to spread this approach and make it available all over the world. In order to do that, as we continue to take care of patients here, we decided to greatly increase our efforts in education. We have been organizing annual workshops and boot camps at Columbia University Medical Center to teach professionals how to run a program similar to ours in their own institutions, and we are available to go to other hospitals nationally and internationally to help people start their own programs.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

So, their life will be short but, for them, it will be a beautiful experience of love and welcoming.” Depending on the family’s background—religious, social, racial, etc.—we try to craft a plan that follows the medical and non-medical needs of each baby. One of our mottos is, “Before death there is life.” Our entire program is focused on the fact that there is life now, when this baby is within mom, and after birth up to when he or she breathes their last. Fathers especially are very worried about facing the moment of birth followed by death. We really make a point to emphasize that, yes, it’s going to be excruciating pain and that’s why we will be with them, but we promise that it’s also going to be a celebration of joy and honoring life. They send us cards year after year, perhaps with pictures of other babies born after that one, but always remembering the baby with the short life as someone very special. Regarding our colleagues, I think they also love this program. Our proposal is to have baby/family bonding in a private space, so the busy NICU is not a proper place. Ideally these babies should be with mom and family in post-partum, however, the nurses in post-partum are used to taking care only of mothers and healthy babies. Well, we have been offering a big deal of education, and after ten years we succeeded in obtaining a significant culture change: In our institution, no baby with life-limiting condition comes to the NICU, but they all follow mom in post-partum. This setting is unique, so much so that we have families coming from very far to deliver in our hospital. Doctors and even administrators also appreciate this program because, first of all, there is family satisfaction, and these babies also don’t take up beds in the NICU, so there’s no need to fight for beds or to occupy beds that could be occupied by babies who can be saved, as there’s no need for these babies to be isolated in the NICU. Is a program like this unusual? These are centers where there are obstetricians who follow and support women expecting babies with life-limiting conditions. What is really special here is that our team is involved at the moment of prenatal diagnosis, during delivery welcoming the baby and seeing what medical needs the baby has, following the baby afterwards, and following the family long-term for years. What makes us different is the continuity of care which includes the care of mom, baby, and family. What has it been like for you to work on this? I want babies to live and have a happy life. I never thought about palliative care as something that would interest me because I want babies to live, obviously. This kind of approach became my love because, again, I want to save babies’ lives, but to save their lives is to save whatever life they’re supposed to have. I need to stay with them, where they are, whether they have a long or a short life. If my medical knowledge and experience cannot heal their illness and make them healthy, I need to stay with them up to very last moment. It’s a very rewarding experience because I can satisfy their needs all throughout their life and also support their parents in a situation which seems impossible to face. In fact, how can you face your child dying in your arms? From a professional point of view this innovative program is also satisfying. But it is also satisfying to me because it is an answer to a need that I had. My first story is about a single mother in her early forties. This mom was offered the option to terminate the pregnancy, but she said, “No. I would like to see him, to hold him, to kiss him, and to protect his life up to the very end.” So, I met her with my team, we gave her our proposal, and made a plan. Yes, there is life before death and she was fully living her motherhood. I have a second story. But her parents are very proud of her because, in a sense, her body took care of herself. We don’t condemn anybody to death. It is about Siamese twins. They refused, however, saying simply, “These are our babies.” So, they opted to carry the babies to term. Many people were commenting that the woman should have terminated the pregnancy. The people were the same, and yet they were completely changed. The fact that everybody was changed, that everybody was moved, bears witness to this, and it is further evidence that we all share the same heart despite differing ideologies or preconceptions. In this time of tension between the pro-choice and the pro-life movements, both sides at times seems to feel ideological. Your project, instead, seems to affirm life without being ideological. Absolutely. That’s why we propose our option to families who receive a bad diagnosis during pregnancy and are open with us, but we are open to the fact that occasionally there are families who, after meeting us, decide otherwise. We propose that it is possible to be parents and hold your baby in your arms even if his or her life is very brief. This is a choice that allows one to fully experience motherhood and fatherhood. That’s why, after we offer our proposal, the vast majority of families we meet follows us. I am convinced that each mother and father has an irrevocable, original, and fundamental desire to support life and to love their babies as much as they can. Our proposal is meant to support this irrevocable desire and we are available to anyone who would like to follow our plan. Everything else is ideological and I have no interest in discussing it. In fact, what is unique in our program is that we always put ourselves in the babies’ shoes. While we keep in mind each family’s desires and expectations, we are about what the baby needs to feel, what the baby needs to hear, and so the program is very much baby-oriented because those are my champions. We also understand that we can’t possibly take care of all babies in need of our help and, in reality, our vision is to spread this approach and make it available all over the world. In order to do that, as we continue to take care of patients here, we decided to greatly increase our efforts in education. We have been organizing annual workshops and boot camps at Columbia University Medical Center to teach professionals how to run a program similar to ours in their own institutions, and we are available to go to other hospitals nationally and internationally to help people start their own programs.\n\n"

History\n\nNineteenth century\nEmory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. Yun became an important political activist in Korea and is the author of \"Aegukga\", the national anthem of the Republic of Korea. Twentieth century\nOn August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts. His memoir, \"Barbed Wire Surgeon\", is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Women's and civil rights movements\nThe women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009. In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. Expansion and modernization\nThe course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. Twenty-first century\n\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December. Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's twenty-first president in August 2020. In 2021, Emory University received 33,780 applications in which Emory College admitted 4,343 of first year undergraduate applicants, a 13% admission rate. The enrolling class was 57% female, 43% male. 50% came from public high schools; 50% came from private/independent schools; and 11% of enrolling class identify as first-generation college students. 54 unique languages were spoken in the enrolling first year class and 101 different countries were represented.

The Princeton Review named the Emory University School of Law as one of the best 169 law schools in the U.S. in 2014. The Economist ranked Goizueta Business School's MBA program 27th in the nation in 2019. In 2012, following an internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law Firm, Emory University announced that members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research. In 2015, Emory University, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Public Health Foundation of India, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences established the Center for Control of Chronic Conditions in New Delhi, India. The center aims to improve the prevention and care of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental health, and injuries in India. In 2015, the Emory Global Health Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were made lead partners for the newly created, $75 million Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Network (CHAMPS). In 2015, the university received an $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH to examine the effects of maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.

In 2015, Emory University and the University of South Florida received a $2.5 million grant over five years from the John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) to study links between infectious disease transmission and agricultural practices. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Emory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The campus is home to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Gaugamela. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina-based Duda Paine Architects. Student life\n\nStudent body\nEmory University's total enrollment for fall 2019 was 15,398 students, with 8,101 undergraduates and 7,297 graduate and professional students. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy. Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement. Debating was established at the university in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed in 1914. Community service\nThe university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club. Emory Cares International Service Day brings together students, alumni and other community members to volunteer at a number of projects organized by Emory and its many partners around the city of Atlanta and in cities worldwide.

Greek life\nFraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's \"temple\" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students' concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Emory has a partnership with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period for \"Service for Learning\" which projects that Emory student volunteers participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well as restore neighborhood parks. Emory University also has many Black student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS).

This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\" Using biblical imagery (Psalm 118, v.22), Stephens argued that divine laws consigned African Americans to slavery as the \"substratum of our society\" by saying: \"Our confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws. This stone which was rejected by the first builders 'is become the chief of the corner'—the real 'corner-stone'—in our new edifice.\" rulers will not quail before the need to use the \"method\" of \"death\"; about death \"they will have no superstitions.\" \"[G]ood scientifically caused pain\" may also be used, but its use can be \"unsafe and demoralizing\" for those who inflict it. So \"[t]o kill under the seemly conditions science will afford is a far less offensive thing.\" Sexual morality, on the other hand, will be comprehensively liberalized, facilitating the goal of having \"perhaps half the population of the world, in every generation, restrained from or tempted to evade reproduction.\" Declaring these to be policies devoted to \"a purpose greater than happiness,\" Wells declares that it is not for immortality, but for the \"spacious\" \"future of our race\" [i.e. the human race], that the \"kinetic men of the coming time\" will \"live and die.\" in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed ... for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.

Emory University has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology. Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. The university operates the Confucius Institute in Atlanta in partnership with Nanjing University. Emory University students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign countries. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society are national affiliate institutions located adjacent to the campus. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and is cited for high scientific performance and citation impact in the CWTS Leiden Ranking. The National Science Foundation ranked the university 36th among academic institutions in the United States for research and development (R&D) expenditures. In 1995 Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities, an association of the 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada.

Emory University has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology. Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. The university operates the Confucius Institute in Atlanta in partnership with Nanjing University. Emory University students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign countries. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society are national affiliate institutions located adjacent to the campus. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and is cited for high scientific performance and citation impact in the CWTS Leiden Ranking. The National Science Foundation ranked the university 36th among academic institutions in the United States for research and development (R&D) expenditures. In 1995 Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities, an association of the 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. Emory faculty and alumni include two Prime Ministers, nine university presidents, 11 members of the United States Congress, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a Vice President of the United States, a United States Speaker of the House, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include 21 Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Emmy Award winners, MacArthur Fellows, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, an Olympic gold medalist and Doug Demuro. History\n\nNineteenth century\nEmory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. Yun became an important political activist in Korea and is the author of \"Aegukga\", the national anthem of the Republic of Korea. Twentieth century\nOn August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts. His memoir, \"Barbed Wire Surgeon\", is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Women's and civil rights movements\nThe women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009. In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. Expansion and modernization\nThe course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. Twenty-first century\n\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December. Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's twenty-first president in August 2020. In 2021, Emory University received 33,780 applications in which Emory College admitted 4,343 of first year undergraduate applicants, a 13% admission rate. The enrolling class was 57% female, 43% male. 50% came from public high schools; 50% came from private/independent schools; and 11% of enrolling class identify as first-generation college students. 54 unique languages were spoken in the enrolling first year class and 101 different countries were represented.

This, our new government, is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, and moral truth.\" Using biblical imagery (Psalm 118, v.22), Stephens argued that divine laws consigned African Americans to slavery as the \"substratum of our society\" by saying: \"Our confederacy is founded upon principles in strict conformity with these laws. This stone which was rejected by the first builders 'is become the chief of the corner'—the real 'corner-stone'—in our new edifice.\" rulers will not quail before the need to use the \"method\" of \"death\"; about death \"they will have no superstitions.\" \"[G]ood scientifically caused pain\" may also be used, but its use can be \"unsafe and demoralizing\" for those who inflict it. So \"[t]o kill under the seemly conditions science will afford is a far less offensive thing.\" Sexual morality, on the other hand, will be comprehensively liberalized, facilitating the goal of having \"perhaps half the population of the world, in every generation, restrained from or tempted to evade reproduction.\" Declaring these to be policies devoted to \"a purpose greater than happiness,\" Wells declares that it is not for immortality, but for the \"spacious\" \"future of our race\" [i.e. the human race], that the \"kinetic men of the coming time\" will \"live and die.\" in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed ... for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.

Emory University has nine academic divisions: Emory College of Arts and Sciences, Oxford College, Goizueta Business School, Laney Graduate School, School of Law, School of Medicine, Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, Rollins School of Public Health, and the Candler School of Theology. Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Peking University in Beijing, China jointly administer the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering. The university operates the Confucius Institute in Atlanta in partnership with Nanjing University. Emory University students come from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, five territories of the United States, and over 100 foreign countries. The International Association of National Public Health Institutes is headquartered at the university and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Cancer Society are national affiliate institutions located adjacent to the campus. The university is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\" and is cited for high scientific performance and citation impact in the CWTS Leiden Ranking. The National Science Foundation ranked the university 36th among academic institutions in the United States for research and development (R&D) expenditures. In 1995 Emory University was elected to the Association of American Universities, an association of the 66 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. Emory faculty and alumni include two Prime Ministers, nine university presidents, 11 members of the United States Congress, two Nobel Peace Prize laureates, a Vice President of the United States, a United States Speaker of the House, and a United States Supreme Court Justice. Other notable alumni include 21 Rhodes Scholars and six Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Emmy Award winners, MacArthur Fellows, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, heads of state and other leaders in foreign government, academics, musicians, an Olympic gold medalist and Doug Demuro. History\n\nNineteenth century\nEmory College was founded in 1836 in Oxford, Georgia by the Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1880, Atticus Greene Haygood, Emory College President, delivered a speech expressing gratitude for the end of slavery in the United States, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a New York banker. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment. In the 1880s, the technology department was launched by Isaac Stiles Hopkins, a polymath professor at Emory College. Emory University's first international student, Yun Chi-ho, graduated in 1893. Yun became an important political activist in Korea and is the author of \"Aegukga\", the national anthem of the Republic of Korea. Twentieth century\nOn August 16, 1906, the Wesley Memorial Hospital and Training School for Nurses, later renamed the Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing, was established. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Emory University established its reputation as a regional institution that offered a solid education in medicine, law, theology, business, and the liberal arts. His memoir, \"Barbed Wire Surgeon\", is considered one of the finest accounts concerning allied prisoners under Japanese captivity and highlights the abuses of the war criminal Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, who graduated from the Candler School of Theology in 1940 and is portrayed in John Hersey's Hiroshima, was able to organize the Hiroshima Maidens reconstructive surgery program based on the associations he made while studying in the United States. Tatsumasa Shirakawa, a Japanese student at the Candler School of Theology, was placed under arrest temporarily until Dean Henry Burton Trimble negotiated his release. Women's and civil rights movements\nThe women's movement and civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States profoundly shaped the future of Emory University. Although it had previously admitted women under limited circumstances, the university had never before had a policy through which they could enroll in large numbers and as resident students. In 1962, in the midst of the civil rights movement, Emory embraced the initiative to end racial restrictions when it asked the courts to declare portions of the Georgia statutes unconstitutional. Marvin S. Arrington Sr. was Emory University's first, full-time African American student and graduated from Emory University School of Law in 1967. In addition to leading universities in the Southeastern United States in the promotion of racial equality, Laney and many of the school's faculty and administrators were outspoken advocates of global human rights and thus were openly opposed to the military dictatorship in South Korea (1961–1987). On March 30, 1983, Laney's friend Kim Dae-jung, while in political exile in the United States, presented a speech on human rights and democracy at Emory University and accepted an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. Kim would go on to play a major role in ending authoritarianism in South Korea, served as the eighth President of South Korea from 1998 to 2003, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his successful implementation of the Sunshine Policy. Laney would later serve as United States Ambassador to South Korea and the Emory graduate school, founded in 1919, was named in his honor in 2009. In 2005, the university presented the President Medal, a rare award conferred only on individuals whose impact on the world has enhanced the dominion of peace or has enlarged the range of cultural achievement, to Civil Rights Movement activist Rosa Parks. In 2014, at Emory's 169th Commencement, John Lewis, the only living \"Big Six\" leader of the civil rights movement, delivered the keynote address and received an honorary doctor of laws degree. In 2015, Emory University School of Law received a $1.5 million donation to help establish a John Lewis Chair in Civil Rights and Social Justice. The gift, given anonymously, funds a professorship which will enable Emory Law to conduct a national search for a scholar with an established academic profile of distinction and a demonstrated desire to promote the rule of law through the study of civil rights. Expansion and modernization\nThe course of Emory's history changed dramatically in November 1979 when Robert Winship Woodruff and George Waldo Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in Coca-Cola stock. Twenty-first century\n\nThe latest additions to the Atlanta Campus include buildings for cancer research, biomedical research, scientific computation, mathematics and science, vaccine research, and the performing arts. In 2016 the university stated that it intended to petition to be annexed into the City of Atlanta; in 2017 the university leadership formally submitted its petition. The City of Atlanta annexed Emory's campus effective January 1, 2018, a part of its largest annexation within a period of 65 years; the Atlanta City Council voted to do so the prior December. Gregory L. Fenves, formerly the president of the University of Texas at Austin, became Emory University's twenty-first president in August 2020. In 2021, Emory University received 33,780 applications in which Emory College admitted 4,343 of first year undergraduate applicants, a 13% admission rate. The enrolling class was 57% female, 43% male. 50% came from public high schools; 50% came from private/independent schools; and 11% of enrolling class identify as first-generation college students. 54 unique languages were spoken in the enrolling first year class and 101 different countries were represented. Undergraduate schools\n\n Emory College of Arts and Sciences (1836)\nThe Emory College of Arts and Sciences offers the Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) and the Bachelor of Science (B.S) undergraduate academic degrees.

Subject specialist librarians provided research assistance for every academic department at the university. Rankings and reputation\n\nEmory University is ranked 21st among national universities in the United States and 71st among global universities by U.S. News & World Report, 98th among global universities and 19th in the United States in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings for 2017–18. The university was ranked 17th among colleges and universities in the United States in a The Wall Street Journal survey. The Princeton Review named the Emory University School of Law as one of the best 169 law schools in the U.S. in 2014. The Economist ranked Goizueta Business School's MBA program 27th in the nation in 2019. In 2012, following an internal investigation led by Emory Provost Earl Lewis and Jones Day Law Firm, Emory University announced that members of Emory University's Office of Admission and Institutional Research intentionally misreported data concerning entering students' standardized test scores and class rankings between 2000 and 2012 to standard reference sources and third parties who rank colleges and universities. Emory University's African Center of Excellence for Public Health Security, which seeks to improve preparedness and response to health threats in low-income countries, is a five-year, multimillion-dollar cooperative program with the CDC and International Association of National Public Health Institutes (IANPHI). The Emory University Center for Global Safe Water (CGSW), which conducts applied research, evaluation, and training to promote global health equity through universal access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, works in collaboration with the CDC. The isolation and treatment facilities at Emory University played a crucial role in ending the 2014 Ebola virus cases in the United States. In 2015, Emory was made a member of the CDC's Prevention Epicenters Program, a research program in which CDC's Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) collaborates with academic investigators to conduct innovative infection control and prevention research. In 2015, Emory University, the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the Public Health Foundation of India, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences established the Center for Control of Chronic Conditions in New Delhi, India. The center aims to improve the prevention and care of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, mental health, and injuries in India. In 2015, the Emory Global Health Institute and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were made lead partners for the newly created, $75 million Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-funded Child Health and Mortality Prevention Surveillance Network (CHAMPS). In 2015, the university received an $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH to examine the effects of maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India. In 2015, the United States Department of Health and Human Services named Emory University the lead coordinating center for the National Ebola Training and Education Center (NETEC). In 2015, Emory University and the University of South Florida received a $2.5 million grant over five years from the John E. Fogarty International Center (FIC) to study links between infectious disease transmission and agricultural practices. The 56-acre campus, located 38 miles east of Emory's Atlanta Campus, is home to Oxford College of Emory University and was the site of military headquarters and infirmaries during the American Civil War. Emory's Atlanta Campus, established in the early twentieth century on a Beaux-Arts master plan by Pittsburgh architect Henry Hornbostel, covers more than 600 acres in Atlanta's historic neighborhood of Druid Hills. The campus is home to the Emory University Hospital, Michael C. Carlos Museum, which has the largest collection of ancient artifacts in the Southeastern United States, the Winship Cancer Institute, Georgia's first and only cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute, the Yerkes National Primate Research Center, one of eight National Institutes of Health-funded national primate research centers, and a number of other academic, art, medical, and student facilitates. The frieze depicts Alexander the Great and his army entering Babylon following their victory over the Achaemenid Empire in the Battle of Gaugamela. The university housed international officials and journalists and served as a training facility for Olympians. In February 2017, Emory announced that its R. Howard Dobbs University Center, built in 1986 from a neofuturistic postmodernist design by local architect John C. Portman Jr., to house the university's main student/faculty center and dining hall (Coca-Cola Commons), would be demolished and replaced with a new $98 million Campus Life Center, designed by Durham, North Carolina-based Duda Paine Architects. Student life\n\nStudent body\nEmory University's total enrollment for fall 2019 was 15,398 students, with 8,101 undergraduates and 7,297 graduate and professional students. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy. Rita Dove also gave the keynote address at Emory's 2013 Commencement. Debating was established at the university in 1837 and the intercollegiate debate team was formed in 1914. Community service\nThe university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, Trees Atlanta, PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club. Emory Cares International Service Day brings together students, alumni and other community members to volunteer at a number of projects organized by Emory and its many partners around the city of Atlanta and in cities worldwide. Programs abroad\nThrough the Centers of International Programs Abroad, Emory University students can study in over 40 countries at the top academic institutions in the world including the National University of Singapore, Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies, Nanjing University, Oxford University, Imperial College London, the School of Oriental and African Studies, Yonsei University, Trinity College Dublin, University of St. Andrews, University of Melbourne, Hertie School of Governance, University of Amsterdam, Sciences Po, University of Cape Town, and Tel Aviv University. Greek life\nFraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's \"temple\" of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students' concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event, and the BBA Council which does similar activities for the Goizueta Business School BBA Program. Emory also has several secret societies—the Paladin Society, the D.V.S. Emory has a partnership with Coca-Cola in which they pledged 3 million dollars over a 5-year period for \"Service for Learning\" which projects that Emory student volunteers participate to help preserve nature trails, create urban farms, as well as restore neighborhood parks. Emory University also has many Black student organizations, including: the Black Student Alliance, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and Voices of Inner Strength Gospel Choir (VOIS).

Is not this desiring, like the Jews, to have an earthly king over them, when the Lord their God is their King? Is it not saying in other words, “We will be as the heathen, the families of the countries,” the aliens to the Church of our Redeemer?\" One day he was reciting Kriat Shema, he (Yeshu) came before him (the Rabbi)—it was on his (the Rabbi's) mind to accept him—he (the Rabbi) showed him with his hand, he (Yeshu) thought 'he is pushing him', (Yeshu then) went erected a fish worship, he (his Rabbi) said to him 'return yourself' he (Yeshu) said to him '(so) I learnt from you; 'all who sin and cause others to sin we do not give (are not given) him the ability to repent'.\" - Sotah 47a, Sanhedrin 107 The story ends by invoking a Mishnaic era teaching that Yeshu practised black magic, \n\nFaith healing is the practice of prayer and gestures (such as laying on of hands) that are believed by some to elicit divine intervention in spiritual and physical healing, especially the Christian practice. Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a divine presence and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on empirical evidence of an evidence-based outcome achieved via faith healing. Claims that \"a myriad of techniques\" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being. Many people interpret the Bible, especially the New Testament, as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. The increased interest in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health. \"Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.\" When parents have practiced faith healing rather than medical care, many children have died that otherwise would have been expected to live. In various belief systems\n\nChristianity\n\nOverview\n\nRegarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the Holy Spirit, faith healing often involves the laying on of hands. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : \"He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases\". New Testament\n\nParts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed:  and . Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), who \"bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine\" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, \"And who is my neighbor?\" Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed all who were present every single time. Jesus told his followers to heal the sick  and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a \"wicked and adulterous generation\". In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord. The New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Catholicism\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes two \"not mutually exclusive\" kinds of healing, one justified by science and one justified by faith:\n healing by human \"natural means  through the practice of medicine\" which emphasizes that the theological virtue of \"charity demands that we not neglect natural means of healing people who are ill\" and the cardinal virtue of prudence forewarns not \"to employ a technique that has no scientific support (or even plausibility)\"\n healing by divine grace \"interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental laying on of hands and anointing with oil or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an appeal to the saints for their aid\"\n\nIn 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued \"Instruction on prayers for healing\" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing, which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing. It accepts \"that there may be means of natural healing that have not yet been understood or recognized by science\", but it rejects superstitious practices which are neither compatible with Christian teaching nor compatible with scientific evidence. According to U.S. Catholic magazine, \"Even in this skeptical, postmodern, scientific agemiracles really are possible.\" The Catholic Church has a special Congregation dedicated to the careful investigation of the validity of alleged miracles attributed to prospective saints. Since Catholic Christians believe the lives of canonized saints in the Church will reflect Christ's, many have come to expect healing miracles. According to Catholic Encyclopedia, it is often said that cures at shrines and during Christian pilgrimages are mainly due to psychotherapypartly to confident trust in Divine providence, and partly to the strong expectancy of cure that comes over suggestible persons at these times and places. Among the best-known accounts by Catholics of faith healings are those attributed to the miraculous intercession of the apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary known as Our Lady of Lourdes at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in France and the remissions of life-threatening disease claimed by those who have applied for aid to Saint Jude, who is known as the \"patron saint of lost causes\". Evangelicalism \n\nIn some Pentecostal and Charismatic Evangelical churches, a special place is thus reserved for faith healings with laying on of hands during worship services or for campaigns evangelization. Biblical inerrancy ensures that the miracles and healings described in the Bible are still relevant and may be present in the life of the believer. By the 1930s, several faith healers drew large crowds and established worldwide followings. A former English plumber turned evangelist who lived simply and read nothing but the Bible from the time his wife taught him to read, Wigglesworth traveled around the world preaching about Jesus and performing faith healings. During the 1920s and 1930s, Aimee Semple McPherson was a controversial faith healer of growing popularity during the Great Depression. By the late 1940s, Oral Roberts, who was associated with and promoted by Branham's Voice of Healing magazine also became well known, and he continued with faith healing until the 1980s. Roberts discounted faith healing in the late 1950s, stating, \"I never was a faith healer and I was never raised that way. Christian Science\nChristian Science claims that healing is possible through prayer based on an understanding of God and the underlying spiritual perfection of God's creation. The material world as humanly perceived is believed to not be the spiritual reality. Christian Scientists believe that healing through prayer is possible insofar as it succeeds in bringing the spiritual reality of health into human experience. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not consider themselves to be faith healers since faith or belief in Christian Science is not required on the part of the patient, and because they consider it reliable and provable rather than random. Although there is no hierarchy in Christian Science, Christian Science practitioners devote full time to prayer for others on a professional basis, and advertise in an online directory published by the church. The church believes healings come most often as a result of priesthood blessings given by the laying on of hands; however, prayer often accompanied with fasting is also thought to cause healings. Latter-day Saints believe that the Priesthood of God, held by prophets (such as Moses) and worthy disciples of the Savior, was restored via heavenly messengers to the first prophet of this dispensation, Joseph Smith. Brigham Young stated this effectively, while also noting that the ultimate outcome is still dependent on the will of God. Islam\n\nA number of healing traditions exist among Muslims. Buddhism\nChinese-born Australian businessman Jun Hong Lu was a prominent proponent of the \"Guan Yin Citta Dharma Door\", claiming that practicing the three \"golden practices\" of reciting texts and mantras, liberation of beings, and making vows, laid a solid foundation for improved physical, mental, and psychological well-being, with many followers publicly attesting to have been healed through practice. Scientology\nSome critics of Scientology have referred to some of its practices as being similar to faith healing, based on claims made by L. Ron Hubbard in Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health and other writings. Scientists and doctors generally find that faith healing lacks biological plausibility or epistemic warrant, which is one of the criteria used to judge whether clinical research is ethical and financially justified. A Cochrane review of intercessory prayer found \"although some of the results of individual studies suggest a positive effect of intercessory prayer, the majority do not\". Of the hundred cases reviewed, none revealed that the healer's intervention alone resulted in any improvement or cure of a measurable organic disability. The Global Medical Research Institute (GMRI) was created in 2012 to start collecting medical records of patients who claim to have received a supernatural healing miracle as a result of Christian Spiritual Healing practices. The organization has a panel of medical doctors who review the patient's records looking at entries prior to the claimed miracles and entries after the miracle was claimed to have taken place. A 2011 article in the New Scientist magazine cited positive physical results from meditation, positive thinking and spiritual faith\n\nCriticism\n\nSkeptics of faith healing offer primarily two explanations for anecdotes of cures or improvements, relieving any need to appeal to the supernatural. The first is post hoc ergo propter hoc, meaning that a genuine improvement or spontaneous remission may have been experienced coincidental with but independent from anything the faith healer or patient did or said. In this case, the patient genuinely has been helped by the faith healer or faith-based remedy, not through any mysterious or numinous function, but by the power of their own belief that they would be healed. Belgian philosopher and skeptic Etienne Vermeersch coined the term Lourdes effect as a criticism of the magical thinking and placebo effect possibilities for the claimed miraculous cures as there are no documented events where a severed arm has been reattached through faith healing at Lourdes. Vermeersch identifies ambiguity and equivocal nature of the miraculous cures as a key feature of miraculous events. Negative impact on public health\nReliance on faith healing to the exclusion of other forms of treatment can have a public health impact when it reduces or eliminates access to modern medical techniques. Choosing faith healing while rejecting modern medicine can and does cause people to die needlessly. Don Carson is another example of a Christian teacher who has put forward what has been described as an \"open-but-cautious\" view. In dealing with the claims of Warfield, particularly \"Warfield's insistence that miracles ceased\", Carson asserts, \"But this argument stands up only if such miraculous gifts are theologically tied exclusively to a role of attestation; and that is demonstrably not so.\" However, while affirming that he does not expect healing to happen today, Carson is critical of aspects of the faith healing movement, \"Another issue is that of immense abuses in healing practises.... The most common form of abuse is the view that since all illness is directly or indirectly attributable to the devil and his works, and since Christ by his cross has defeated the devil, and by his Spirit has given us the power to overcome him, healing is the inheritance right of all true Christians who call upon the Lord with genuine faith.\" The second level of theological disagreement with Christian faith healing goes further. and encountered throughout the narrative in Acts, these gifts,  particularly when exercised regularly by a given individual, are part of the foundational structure of the church... and so have passed out of the life of the church.\" Fraud\nSkeptics of faith healers point to fraudulent practices either in the healings themselves (such as plants in the audience with fake illnesses), or concurrent with the healing work supposedly taking place and claim that faith healing is a quack practice in which the \"healers\" use well known non-supernatural illusions to exploit credulous people in order to obtain their gratitude, confidence and money. James Randi's The Faith Healers investigates Christian evangelists such as Peter Popoff, who claimed to heal sick people on stage in front of an audience.

Believers assert that the healing of disease and disability can be brought about by religious faith through prayer or other rituals that, according to adherents, can stimulate a divine presence and power. Religious belief in divine intervention does not depend on empirical evidence of an evidence-based outcome achieved via faith healing. Claims that \"a myriad of techniques\" such as prayer, divine intervention, or the ministrations of an individual healer can cure illness have been popular throughout history. There have been claims that faith can cure blindness, deafness, cancer, HIV/AIDS, developmental disorders, anemia, arthritis, corns, defective speech, multiple sclerosis, skin rashes, total body paralysis, and various injuries. It can involve prayer, a visit to a religious shrine, or simply a strong belief in a supreme being. Many people interpret the Bible, especially the New Testament, as teaching belief in, and the practice of, faith healing. The increased interest in alternative medicine at the end of the 20th century has given rise to a parallel interest among sociologists in the relationship of religion to health. \"Death, disability, and other unwanted outcomes have occurred when faith healing was elected instead of medical care for serious injuries or illnesses.\" When parents have practiced faith healing rather than medical care, many children have died that otherwise would have been expected to live. In various belief systems\n\nChristianity\n\nOverview\n\nRegarded as a Christian belief that God heals people through the power of the Holy Spirit, faith healing often involves the laying on of hands. Pentecostal writer Wilfred Graves Jr. views the healing of the body as a physical expression of salvation. , after describing Jesus exorcising at sunset and healing all of the sick who were brought to him, quotes these miracles as a fulfillment of the prophecy in : \"He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases\". New Testament\n\nParts of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament say that Jesus cured physical ailments well outside the capacity of first-century medicine. At least two other times Jesus credited the sufferer's faith as the means of being healed:  and . Jesus endorsed the use of the medical assistance of the time (medicines of oil and wine) when he told the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37), who \"bound up [an injured man's] wounds, pouring on oil and wine\" (verse 34) as a physician would. Jesus then told the doubting teacher of the law (who had elicited this parable by his self-justifying question, \"And who is my neighbor?\" Some theologians' understanding is that Jesus healed all who were present every single time. Jesus told his followers to heal the sick  and stated that signs such as healing are evidence of faith. Jesus also told his followers to \"cure sick people, raise up dead persons, make lepers clean, expel demons. Jesus did not approve of anyone asking for a sign just for the spectacle of it, describing such as coming from a \"wicked and adulterous generation\". In the New Testament Epistle of James, the faithful are told that to be healed, those who are sick should call upon the elders of the church to pray over [them] and anoint [them] with oil in the name of the Lord. The New Testament says that during Jesus' ministry and after his Resurrection, the apostles healed the sick and cast out demons, made lame men walk, raised the dead and performed other miracles. Catholicism\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church recognizes two \"not mutually exclusive\" kinds of healing, one justified by science and one justified by faith:\n healing by human \"natural means  through the practice of medicine\" which emphasizes that the theological virtue of \"charity demands that we not neglect natural means of healing people who are ill\" and the cardinal virtue of prudence forewarns not \"to employ a technique that has no scientific support (or even plausibility)\"\n healing by divine grace \"interceded on behalf of the sick through the invocation of the name of the Lord Jesus, asking for healing through the power of the Holy Spirit, whether in the form of the sacramental laying on of hands and anointing with oil or of simple prayers for healing, which often include an appeal to the saints for their aid\"\n\nIn 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued \"Instruction on prayers for healing\" with specific norms about prayer meetings for obtaining healing, which presents the Catholic Church's doctrines of sickness and healing.

The Environmental Protection Agency has classified Cadmium as a known carcinogen due to the dangerous effects it can have on human health (5). You can also learn more about how cadmium and how other heavy metals impact health on the heavy metals summit or on a Healing Powers Podcast. Cadmium is an incredibly toxic metal and is ever-present in our environment primarily due to industrial dumping. When one is nutritionally deficient in calcium, iron, protein, and/or zinc, cadmium is absorbed by the body to fill these “nutritional gaps.” (6) Cadmium replaces the deficient nutrients to keep the body running. When this occurs, the metals inhibit, over-stimulate, or otherwise alter thousands of enzymes. Toxic metals may also simply deposit in many sites, causing local irritation and other toxic effects (7). As you can see, the symptoms of cadmium toxicity are in direct correlation to a lack of the healthy minerals they replace (iron, calcium, and zinc). In fact, many need their cigarettes and coffee, and even marijuana, to give them their daily boost to their adrenal glands. · Cancer: Cadmium is a very toxic metal and usually associated with the development of cancers. Cadmium also directly damages nerve cells. · Energy: Cadmium causes strong inhibition of essential enzymes in the Krebs energy cycle. · Bones and Joints: Cadmium alters calcium and phosphorus metabolism, thus contributing to arthritis, osteoporosis and neuromuscular diseases. The findings of one study, conducted by the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Department of Toxicology, at the Medical University of Silesia, showed that cadmium has both a direct and indirect toxic effect on bones (3). Cadmium can contribute to failure to thrive, delayed growth development, and diabetes. · Psychological: Cadmium toxicity is associated with learning disorders and hyperactivity.

Not a dangerous fire, but a cathartic fire which helps to clear away the superfluous and strengthen us. Stories about the angel: He really is good at finding wedding rings. I got psychically to ask Chamuel to help find it. When a planet goes on retrograde, it means the influences from that planet are reduced. When a planet goes retrograde, it appears to move backwards in the sky, from the earth’s perspective. Some planets go retrograde more often and for shorter periods of time whereas some planets go into retrograde infrequently. Knowing what each planet represents and when it is retrograde can help prevent frustration and have more peace of mind in dealing with the issues that are brought to the surface during that retrograde. This past month there have been several planets in retrograde. On the one hand, it may have felt especially challenging and triggering, on the other hand, this means that it was a great time to see what was working and what wasn’t and make modifications. Mercury rules communication, transportation, and technology and deals with anything related to expression. When mercury is in retrograde, it seems to us that there are problems or delays with technology, communication, travel and in general, trying to move forward on plans. It is not a great time to make big commitments, launch new programs or projects, and sign contracts as things may not be as they seem to be during the retrograde period. Even going to and from appointments may seem like more of an ordeal during mercury in retrograde periods with traffic jams, construction delays, or other problems. Most of the frustration during mercury in retrograde periods happens when we fight the tide so to speak, trying to go out when the tide is coming in, etc. So now that you are reading this, we are out of the shadow period for Mercury and the next one isn’t until December 22 of this year. Let's take a look at how the energy of the eclipse will affect you. The number 9 is showing us that the past 9 years cycle of our life needs to be let go. A shift needs to take place so when we start the next 9 year cycle, we are starting with a clean slate. The past is the past, it's time to let it go and create a future full of passion and abundance! It is showing us that after the long 9 year struggle we have gone through, abundance and the Universal gifts are here for us to claim! Leo rules the sun! Remember, Mercury is in Retrograde, (direct on September 5) so wait to make these changes until after it is over to lessen any communication issues that could pop up. This energy will have lasting effects. Eclipse energy is extremely potent and the effects are felt for a year to two years after one has happened. Once baked, I personally like to put almond butter on it though it also tastes great with a coconut spread or vegan cheese. This coming full solar eclipse is getting a lot of buzz! Eclipses bring change, and often times unexpected turnarounds. There is a partial lunar eclipse is coming on August 7/8 around noon Mountain time that will be viewable from Europe and Asia. But don’t worry, you don’t have to see the eclipse for it to impact you and you will likely be able to at least one of the eclipses from your location if you want to make memories of this historic event. Astrologically speaking, it’s like an uber new moon because solar eclipses always happen on new moons. Eclipses often show up as the wild cards to shake up areas in our lives that need shaking up! They often bring about unexpected events and sometimes make us do a 180-degree turn. Though this can be challenging, it is always for our highest good and in order bring us something better and shift us into new levels of consciousness. By knowing which house the eclipse falls in your chart you can get a better sense of how you will be impacted. Whether or not you look into this in advance, just be aware that the eclipses will bring change, likely quite rapidly. Rather than fight it, think of riding the wave of change and it will go a lot more smoothly. Just like the tide, the change cannot be stopped, only dealt with. We also are living in a society that often views sleep deprivation as a sign that you are hard-working and determined. I do understand that there are times when this must happen short-term, however sleep deprivation can have serious health consequences. Micro-sleep is what happens when your brain essentially goes to sleep or goes into autopilot when you are awake, such as when you drive somewhere and don’t remember doing it. I am a fan of tapping to help release unhealthy beliefs or patterns. I started to do some research on chlorine and fluoride and learned that its highly toxic, and that the kind of fluoride in water is much more toxic than the kind in toothpaste (though I still avoid it in toothpaste as well). I read several articles and blog posts and a few books on water fluoridation including The Case Against Flouride: How Hazardous Waste Ended Up In Our Drinking Water and the Bad Science and Powerful Politics that Keep It There. Pharmaceutical grade fluoride is what is in toothpaste, the kind in water which is byproduct from the phosphate industries. Many countries including China (a country not-known to be toxic and pollution free) do not allow fluoride in water because they consider it too toxic. The amount of fluoride in a glass of water is enough to cause an 8 point IQ drop (enough of a different to move you from the normal to dull range). A 5-point reduction on average of IQ doubles the number of people considered mentally retarded so this is a significant statistic. There is a financial aspect to IQ loss as it relates to a person’s ability to make better money. Flouride collects in the pineal gland (believed to be the 3rd eye is housed in the brain) and can increase hypothyroidism and create goiters. There is also evidence of increased cell death, arthritis, dementia, bone fractures, and cancer. Since I was already doing a lot of purging and had recently left a toxic relationship, my chakras were very clogged and there was a lot of clearing to do. I have been known to feel nauseous when my solar plexus chakra is clearing and feel intense heart pain when the heart chakra is clearing. The chakras are arranged at the center of the body with the first chakra sitting at the base of the spine going all the way to the crown chakra at the top of the head. In my book Angels and Manifesting, I created a chakra chart to go over the different chakras, what they represent, their colors, and associated emotions and blocks. You can get comfortable and listen to this meditation to help identify issues and blocks and then work to heal them. It operates behind a similar principle as acupressure or acupuncture. It sounds quite simple but I have found it to be quite profound in its impact and one of the amazing aspects of it is that it happens fast! The first step is to identify the issue. Often when we release the blockage, it gives us more ease in dealing with the practical aspects of the issue as well as releases the negative emotion which increases our vibration and allows us to manifest bigger and better things and experiences. Again, choose one issue at a time and run through all the points tapping on the same phrase. The next step is to rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 on that particular issue. In others words, how bad is it with 10 being the worst and 1 being the best? You can do this just by checking in with yourself and see what number pops up in your mind. Use the diagrams to reference the points below. After one or two rounds of tapping, stop and pause to rate yourself. If it has but has not gone down very far, keep going. Sometimes we need some time to integrate the energy shifts and may feel overwhelmed if we try to clear too much at a time. That said, it is possible to clear blocks very quickly and relatively easily using this technique! This work is very effective however it can be like the layers of the onion. Once you work on one phrase, there may be a related phrase or topic which pops up to clear. You can also watch the instructional video that Laura made about tapping on iTunes or YouTube. You can also ask your angels to give you suggestions and help with ideas. Make sure they are smart (specific, measurable, action-oriented, rewarding, timely and tangible). I recommend asking Archangel Michael, Raphael, Jophiel, and Zadkiel (plus any other angel you’d like to call on) as well as your guardian angel. There is no right or wrong way to do this simply, silently or verbally invite your angels to assist with your manifestations. To give your manifestations more power, you can light a white candle and focus on the list and visualize them manifesting every day for a week! Also, remember that when you are overwhelmed by events beyond your control, you can ask the angels to intervene. The more of you that ask us for help, the more the world can transform! We are going through a big time of energy shifts and transitions right now. One of the biggest blocks I see to positive change with clients is resistance to change. When our energy shifts, moving forward (change) is inevitable and is a direct result of the shifting however some people dig in their heels. If the answer is fear of change, or fear of success (they are often tied to together) it is likely you are in resistance. Ask the angels to help you release any fear of change and allow you to move forward. Often times the things that we resist benefit us the most. Getting at the root of why we are in resistance can often be extremely enlightening and helpful. For example, I had a lot of resistance when I started out in my psychic work. When I examined my resistance, it was rooted in fear of being judged or persecuted. Avoiding anything that led to this fear would also have held me back on my path, my purpose, and success. This fear was also based on a false premise (as many fears are) that with visibility would come persecution and pain. Therefore, it was important for me to face and move through this resistance or it would have blocked the good things I wanted in life. As they say in Star Trek, “Resistance is futile,” and I have truly found it to be so! Sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate the difference between something that you are resistance to that is good for us and something that is just generally bad. Thing about what it is that you are resisting and why. Once you can get at the root of the reason for the resistance, you can determine your own truth and figure out how to move forward in the healthiest way. When I was thinking about this recently as I have been going through big energy shifts, the angels reminded me about how it works with butterflies. This transformation takes a ton of energy, and the caterpillar is doing nothing but transforming. If you think about caterpillar activities versus butterfly activities, so little of what a caterpillar does has any relevance to butterfly. Sometimes that very stuff we feel compelled to do will have little benefit to us once we have shifted energetically. Allow plenty of shifting, you may need way more than you think you need. Think about butterflies when they are going through their biggest transformation, they go into a chrysalis and don’t do anything except focus on transforming themselves. Remember many of you are going through this type of transition yourselves and transforming takes a lot of energy and of course time. While you head may say, “hold on, this is too much,” remember my first point, resistance is futile. When releasing belongings, a professional organizer helped me use these parameters to help determine what to keep and it was life-changing: only hold onto things if you love them or would by them now in their current condition. First of all, let’s go over eclipses and what they are. Eclipses are times of revealing and things set in motion during an eclipse have a deep impact for the next 6 months or more. They are powerful times for manifesting. Whatever happens and whatever we create during the eclipses has a large impact on the next several months and the future. As a result of this, I very specifically set some clear intentions during the eclipse and a few hours later my plans for the week were deeply impacted by a cancellation with a friend while traveling. This then had a ripple effect as I met entirely new people and set a new course for myself. I feel strongly that this new course was set as a result of my intention setting during the eclipse. In an eclipse, the sun which represents of our conscious awareness gets blocked by the moon which represents what is hidden but true. In this case, the moon is literally eclipsing the sun and blocking out its light. The earth is then between the moon and the sun. The earth’s shadow blocks the light from the sun hitting the moon and plunges the moon into darkness. Eclipses always bring about change and what may seem like chaos but there is an underlying order. In essence, a new moon eclipse is an uber new moon and a full moon eclipse is an uber full moon. We have eclipses coming up. The eclipses in March were to stir up things up and get us to think about things we might not have while the September eclipses will firm things up for us bring clarity and movement. The last several months have been about identifying issues that need to be resolved and cleared and after this set of eclipses, it will be easier to move forward and you will have the clarity and be empowered to act with more confidence. One of the themes from this coming sets of eclipses that is coming up is turning the focus from other back to ourselves. If we fight this lesson, it will be harder for us in the long term. One of the benefits of these eclipses is that they bring things up for us for review and clearing so that we can manifest on a brighter, clearer level once they are cleared for us. In particular, you might feel extra emotional during a full moon eclipse as you are purging and releasing old patterns, emotions, relationships, and situations which are not serving you on your path. Eclipses also create change fast and may create situations which mean change that you thought was going to happen in years has to happen in weeks or at the moment. Again don’t fight it, these things are for your evolution and your good. You will have six months to shift and incorporate the changes before the next set of eclipses comes and asks you to shift and evolve yet again. This often doesn’t go well when we are trying to learn something new. It was kind of like trying to teach yourself complex math with just a text book and no teacher (I should know; I have tried to do that before but that is another story). In guided meditation you listen to someone who guides you through visualizations and relaxation techniques and for me this has made all the difference between failure and success. There are so many benefits to meditation and if you want to improve your life dramatically in a whole host of ways then there is no reason you should not be practicing meditation. We live is such a stress oriented, active society but often we are working so hard to try to create a good quality of life but that are stressed in body in mind which is not a good quality of life. There is a reason they call it practicing! Meditation is not easy at first but most people expect that it should be. You wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without training so don’t expect yourself to be able to meditation easily without some practice first too. It sounds simple to sit and focus or not focus depending on how you look at it for a few minutes to an hour at a time, but it will feel hard at first and that’s ok. It’s called a practice for a reason because you do need to work at it. And there are many benefits from doing even if it seems like you are terrible at it at first. If you want to explore meditating, there are some great easy resources to do so. You can download my grounding and clearing audio meditation which helps you learn how to ground yourself and clear your energy field. Deepak Chopra has some great free ones as does Philip Permutt on that playlist so there is literally no reason not to try it. On September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the Rice University football stadium in Houston, Texas. A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows: \"There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all.

Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not \"first but, first and, first if, but first period\".

This is the number of great manifestation of wealth and success through action. Be of service to others by sharing your expertise. It is part of the prosperity you are here to experience. You are supported and protected when you infuse your message with a win/win attitude. This is an excerpt from Laura Powers’ forthcoming book on Archangels and Ascended Masters! Do not fear this change. Imagine yourself like metal that is forged through the fire. Know that you are never sent anything you cannot handle. Invocation: Archangel Chamuel, please help me find what I have lost, and find what I need in myself to heal and feel inner peace. Other comments: When I see Chamuel, he is often on fire. Not a dangerous fire, but a cathartic fire which helps to clear away the superfluous and strengthen us. Stories about the angel: He really is good at finding wedding rings. I got psychically to ask Chamuel to help find it. When a planet goes on retrograde, it means the influences from that planet are reduced. When a planet goes retrograde, it appears to move backwards in the sky, from the earth’s perspective. Some planets go retrograde more often and for shorter periods of time whereas some planets go into retrograde infrequently. Knowing what each planet represents and when it is retrograde can help prevent frustration and have more peace of mind in dealing with the issues that are brought to the surface during that retrograde. This past month there have been several planets in retrograde. On the one hand, it may have felt especially challenging and triggering, on the other hand, this means that it was a great time to see what was working and what wasn’t and make modifications. Mercury rules communication, transportation, and technology and deals with anything related to expression. When mercury is in retrograde, it seems to us that there are problems or delays with technology, communication, travel and in general, trying to move forward on plans. It is not a great time to make big commitments, launch new programs or projects, and sign contracts as things may not be as they seem to be during the retrograde period. Even going to and from appointments may seem like more of an ordeal during mercury in retrograde periods with traffic jams, construction delays, or other problems. Most of the frustration during mercury in retrograde periods happens when we fight the tide so to speak, trying to go out when the tide is coming in, etc. So now that you are reading this, we are out of the shadow period for Mercury and the next one isn’t until December 22 of this year. Let's take a look at how the energy of the eclipse will affect you. The number 9 is showing us that the past 9 years cycle of our life needs to be let go. A shift needs to take place so when we start the next 9 year cycle, we are starting with a clean slate. The past is the past, it's time to let it go and create a future full of passion and abundance! It is showing us that after the long 9 year struggle we have gone through, abundance and the Universal gifts are here for us to claim! Leo rules the sun! Remember, Mercury is in Retrograde, (direct on September 5) so wait to make these changes until after it is over to lessen any communication issues that could pop up. This energy will have lasting effects. Eclipse energy is extremely potent and the effects are felt for a year to two years after one has happened. Once baked, I personally like to put almond butter on it though it also tastes great with a coconut spread or vegan cheese. This coming full solar eclipse is getting a lot of buzz! Eclipses bring change, and often times unexpected turnarounds. There is a partial lunar eclipse is coming on August 7/8 around noon Mountain time that will be viewable from Europe and Asia. But don’t worry, you don’t have to see the eclipse for it to impact you and you will likely be able to at least one of the eclipses from your location if you want to make memories of this historic event. Astrologically speaking, it’s like an uber new moon because solar eclipses always happen on new moons. Eclipses often show up as the wild cards to shake up areas in our lives that need shaking up! They often bring about unexpected events and sometimes make us do a 180-degree turn. Though this can be challenging, it is always for our highest good and in order bring us something better and shift us into new levels of consciousness. By knowing which house the eclipse falls in your chart you can get a better sense of how you will be impacted. Whether or not you look into this in advance, just be aware that the eclipses will bring change, likely quite rapidly. Rather than fight it, think of riding the wave of change and it will go a lot more smoothly. Just like the tide, the change cannot be stopped, only dealt with. We also are living in a society that often views sleep deprivation as a sign that you are hard-working and determined. I do understand that there are times when this must happen short-term, however sleep deprivation can have serious health consequences. Micro-sleep is what happens when your brain essentially goes to sleep or goes into autopilot when you are awake, such as when you drive somewhere and don’t remember doing it. I am a fan of tapping to help release unhealthy beliefs or patterns. I started to do some research on chlorine and fluoride and learned that its highly toxic, and that the kind of fluoride in water is much more toxic than the kind in toothpaste (though I still avoid it in toothpaste as well). I read several articles and blog posts and a few books on water fluoridation including The Case Against Flouride: How Hazardous Waste Ended Up In Our Drinking Water and the Bad Science and Powerful Politics that Keep It There. Pharmaceutical grade fluoride is what is in toothpaste, the kind in water which is byproduct from the phosphate industries. Many countries including China (a country not-known to be toxic and pollution free) do not allow fluoride in water because they consider it too toxic. The amount of fluoride in a glass of water is enough to cause an 8 point IQ drop (enough of a different to move you from the normal to dull range). A 5-point reduction on average of IQ doubles the number of people considered mentally retarded so this is a significant statistic. There is a financial aspect to IQ loss as it relates to a person’s ability to make better money. Flouride collects in the pineal gland (believed to be the 3rd eye is housed in the brain) and can increase hypothyroidism and create goiters. There is also evidence of increased cell death, arthritis, dementia, bone fractures, and cancer. Since I was already doing a lot of purging and had recently left a toxic relationship, my chakras were very clogged and there was a lot of clearing to do. I have been known to feel nauseous when my solar plexus chakra is clearing and feel intense heart pain when the heart chakra is clearing. The chakras are arranged at the center of the body with the first chakra sitting at the base of the spine going all the way to the crown chakra at the top of the head. In my book Angels and Manifesting, I created a chakra chart to go over the different chakras, what they represent, their colors, and associated emotions and blocks. You can get comfortable and listen to this meditation to help identify issues and blocks and then work to heal them. It operates behind a similar principle as acupressure or acupuncture. It sounds quite simple but I have found it to be quite profound in its impact and one of the amazing aspects of it is that it happens fast! The first step is to identify the issue. Often when we release the blockage, it gives us more ease in dealing with the practical aspects of the issue as well as releases the negative emotion which increases our vibration and allows us to manifest bigger and better things and experiences. Again, choose one issue at a time and run through all the points tapping on the same phrase. The next step is to rate yourself on a scale of 1 to 10 on that particular issue. In others words, how bad is it with 10 being the worst and 1 being the best? You can do this just by checking in with yourself and see what number pops up in your mind. Use the diagrams to reference the points below. After one or two rounds of tapping, stop and pause to rate yourself. If it has but has not gone down very far, keep going. Sometimes we need some time to integrate the energy shifts and may feel overwhelmed if we try to clear too much at a time. That said, it is possible to clear blocks very quickly and relatively easily using this technique! This work is very effective however it can be like the layers of the onion. Once you work on one phrase, there may be a related phrase or topic which pops up to clear. You can also watch the instructional video that Laura made about tapping on iTunes or YouTube. You can also ask your angels to give you suggestions and help with ideas. Make sure they are smart (specific, measurable, action-oriented, rewarding, timely and tangible). I recommend asking Archangel Michael, Raphael, Jophiel, and Zadkiel (plus any other angel you’d like to call on) as well as your guardian angel. There is no right or wrong way to do this simply, silently or verbally invite your angels to assist with your manifestations. To give your manifestations more power, you can light a white candle and focus on the list and visualize them manifesting every day for a week! Also, remember that when you are overwhelmed by events beyond your control, you can ask the angels to intervene. The more of you that ask us for help, the more the world can transform! We are going through a big time of energy shifts and transitions right now. One of the biggest blocks I see to positive change with clients is resistance to change. When our energy shifts, moving forward (change) is inevitable and is a direct result of the shifting however some people dig in their heels. If the answer is fear of change, or fear of success (they are often tied to together) it is likely you are in resistance. Ask the angels to help you release any fear of change and allow you to move forward. Often times the things that we resist benefit us the most. Getting at the root of why we are in resistance can often be extremely enlightening and helpful. For example, I had a lot of resistance when I started out in my psychic work. When I examined my resistance, it was rooted in fear of being judged or persecuted. Avoiding anything that led to this fear would also have held me back on my path, my purpose, and success. This fear was also based on a false premise (as many fears are) that with visibility would come persecution and pain. Therefore, it was important for me to face and move through this resistance or it would have blocked the good things I wanted in life. As they say in Star Trek, “Resistance is futile,” and I have truly found it to be so! Sometimes it can be difficult to differentiate the difference between something that you are resistance to that is good for us and something that is just generally bad. Thing about what it is that you are resisting and why. Once you can get at the root of the reason for the resistance, you can determine your own truth and figure out how to move forward in the healthiest way. When I was thinking about this recently as I have been going through big energy shifts, the angels reminded me about how it works with butterflies. This transformation takes a ton of energy, and the caterpillar is doing nothing but transforming. If you think about caterpillar activities versus butterfly activities, so little of what a caterpillar does has any relevance to butterfly. Sometimes that very stuff we feel compelled to do will have little benefit to us once we have shifted energetically. Allow plenty of shifting, you may need way more than you think you need. Think about butterflies when they are going through their biggest transformation, they go into a chrysalis and don’t do anything except focus on transforming themselves. Remember many of you are going through this type of transition yourselves and transforming takes a lot of energy and of course time. While you head may say, “hold on, this is too much,” remember my first point, resistance is futile. When releasing belongings, a professional organizer helped me use these parameters to help determine what to keep and it was life-changing: only hold onto things if you love them or would by them now in their current condition. First of all, let’s go over eclipses and what they are. Eclipses are times of revealing and things set in motion during an eclipse have a deep impact for the next 6 months or more. They are powerful times for manifesting. Whatever happens and whatever we create during the eclipses has a large impact on the next several months and the future. As a result of this, I very specifically set some clear intentions during the eclipse and a few hours later my plans for the week were deeply impacted by a cancellation with a friend while traveling. This then had a ripple effect as I met entirely new people and set a new course for myself. I feel strongly that this new course was set as a result of my intention setting during the eclipse. In an eclipse, the sun which represents of our conscious awareness gets blocked by the moon which represents what is hidden but true. In this case, the moon is literally eclipsing the sun and blocking out its light. The earth is then between the moon and the sun. The earth’s shadow blocks the light from the sun hitting the moon and plunges the moon into darkness. Eclipses always bring about change and what may seem like chaos but there is an underlying order. In essence, a new moon eclipse is an uber new moon and a full moon eclipse is an uber full moon. We have eclipses coming up. The eclipses in March were to stir up things up and get us to think about things we might not have while the September eclipses will firm things up for us bring clarity and movement. The last several months have been about identifying issues that need to be resolved and cleared and after this set of eclipses, it will be easier to move forward and you will have the clarity and be empowered to act with more confidence. One of the themes from this coming sets of eclipses that is coming up is turning the focus from other back to ourselves. If we fight this lesson, it will be harder for us in the long term. One of the benefits of these eclipses is that they bring things up for us for review and clearing so that we can manifest on a brighter, clearer level once they are cleared for us. In particular, you might feel extra emotional during a full moon eclipse as you are purging and releasing old patterns, emotions, relationships, and situations which are not serving you on your path. Eclipses also create change fast and may create situations which mean change that you thought was going to happen in years has to happen in weeks or at the moment. Again don’t fight it, these things are for your evolution and your good. You will have six months to shift and incorporate the changes before the next set of eclipses comes and asks you to shift and evolve yet again. This often doesn’t go well when we are trying to learn something new. It was kind of like trying to teach yourself complex math with just a text book and no teacher (I should know; I have tried to do that before but that is another story). In guided meditation you listen to someone who guides you through visualizations and relaxation techniques and for me this has made all the difference between failure and success. There are so many benefits to meditation and if you want to improve your life dramatically in a whole host of ways then there is no reason you should not be practicing meditation. We live is such a stress oriented, active society but often we are working so hard to try to create a good quality of life but that are stressed in body in mind which is not a good quality of life. There is a reason they call it practicing! Meditation is not easy at first but most people expect that it should be. You wouldn’t expect to run a marathon without training so don’t expect yourself to be able to meditation easily without some practice first too. It sounds simple to sit and focus or not focus depending on how you look at it for a few minutes to an hour at a time, but it will feel hard at first and that’s ok. It’s called a practice for a reason because you do need to work at it. And there are many benefits from doing even if it seems like you are terrible at it at first. If you want to explore meditating, there are some great easy resources to do so. You can download my grounding and clearing audio meditation which helps you learn how to ground yourself and clear your energy field. Deepak Chopra has some great free ones as does Philip Permutt on that playlist so there is literally no reason not to try it. On September 12, 1962, Kennedy delivered another speech before a crowd of about 40,000 people in the Rice University football stadium in Houston, Texas. A widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows: \"There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the Moon? And they may well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly \n\n of rocketry, so that the US and Soviet Union would be starting from a position of equality. A crewed mission to the Moon would serve this purpose. On May 25, 1961, Kennedy addressed the United States Congress on \"Urgent National Needs\" and declared:\"I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade [1960s] is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to \n\n Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?We choose to go to the Moon! We choose to go to the Moon... We choose to go to the Moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win, and the others, too.\" In spite of that, the proposed program faced the opposition of many Americans and was dubbed a \"moondoggle\" \n\n In November 1960, John F. Kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the \"missile gap\" that he and many other senators felt had developed between the Soviet Union and the United States due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not \"first but, first and, first if, but first period\". Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little\n\n"

After the release of the hostages on 20 January 1981, mere minutes after Republican challenger Ronald Reagan's inauguration, some charged that the Reagan campaign had made a secret deal with the Iranian government whereby the Iranians would hold the hostages until after Reagan was elected and inaugurated.

As consumers, we have high expectations for our well-being, including life extending treatments for those with chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis, successful cancer chemotherapy regimens, and organ transplant and joint replacement surgeries – we expect to receive these treatments when required and without exception.

Yet none of this should come as a surprise.

The Transatlantic Taskforce on Antimicrobial Resistance (TATFAR) was established by U.S. presidential declaration in 2009 and issued its first report in September 2012, identifying the need for intensified cooperation between the United States and Europe. In India, meanwhile, the publication of the Chennai Declaration led to changes in Indian law aimed at ending the sale of over the counter antibiotics. But while this increased interest is welcome, policymakers must match words with the kind of action that has been seen on challenges such as Alzheimer’s and obesity by ensuring similar levels of funding is in place to further our scientific base for understanding the biology, clinical and social impact of antibiotic resistance. Governments must also do more to encourage drug development. Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger once famously said, “The absence of alternatives clears the mind marvellously.” This perfectly encapsulates the importance of antibiotics to health today, and we must now be bold enough to invest in the infrastructure and innovation needed to protect and replenish the antibiotic treasure trove. We are at a crossroads, and inaction is not an option – a reality that must be acknowledged by politicians, scientists, healthcare professionals and the public alike.

There are some real stories of 80 year old American women, driving south of the border, to Mexico, just to buy a medication that is one tenth of the price here in the US. When we think of healthcare in America when it's a single mother raising her two young daughters who are attending school, as we all know the economy is slow coming back to normal with great paying jobs that can sort of cover our rising cost of healthcare, most of us are kept awake at night looking at the expensive medical bills and wondering should I use the retirement savings or mortgage the house again to pay for the bills. Well America I think we have reached a point where our healthcare system is run like a Mexican Cartel if you can afford then you deserve treatment if you don't have the money well the street is the best place to lie down and die because your healthcare coverage well not pay for your treatment. Our healthcare system in America should not be run like a McDonalds restaurant if you can pay for medical treatment, like most other countries like Cuba and the rest of North America and the world healthcare is a right not a privilege. Speaking to most Americans when I traveled this great land by bus I was talking to a nurse in Panama Beach Florida, she had worked at the local hospital for over twenty years and she had double the amount of healthcare coverage and was still not enough to pay for her medical bills it sadden me, to hear that a frontline nurse worker who cares for patients her entire life is now a patient and the healthcare system in America is denying her coverage that's not right atall in our great nation. As Americans we have a choice in our great land between private hospital's and universal health care which should be right for all Americans, because we are the only nation that pay's more for our drugs and get's screwed when it comes to the medical bills we have to pay for if for cast on our arm after a night of drunken biking down a path or something else in life which requires medical treatment. So America here is our choices we can have universal health care which covers all of our bills, and let's us keep our houses, or we can be depending on our children and great grandchildren to cover our medical expensive for years to come. Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the election of 1976, but his foreign-policy became mired in endless difficulties, including a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and a confrontation with the new anti-American regime in Iran. Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski was a hard-line Cold Warrior opposed to Communism and the USSR. Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball as Secretary of State, but he was vetoed by Brzezinski as too dovish. Vance negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties, along with peace talks in Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. He worked closely \n\n During this time the rest of the international communist movement was also thriving. The communist world expanded dramatically in the decade following World War II with Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, and Vietnam all becoming states dominated by their respective communist parties, usually via military victory. In the United States, Iran was seen as the holder of reserves of petroleum with \"vital strategic\" value to western countries, and as part of \"a Northern Tier\" of countries (along with Greece and Turkey) that constituted a geopolitical \"first line of defense\" for the Mediterranean and for Asia, To counter the activities of the USSR, the CIA established Operation TPBEDAMN in the late 1940s, funded at $1 million a year.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school us history.

Each interacts with the others. All must be faced together, squarely and courageously. We will face these challenges, and we will meet them with the best that is in us.

Democrat Jimmy Carter defeated Ford in the election of 1976, but his foreign-policy became mired in endless difficulties, including a proxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and a confrontation with the new anti-American regime in Iran. Carter had very little foreign policy experience, and he was unable to stop the bitter infighting between his top foreign policy advisers, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, on the dovish side, versus national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski. Brzezinski was a hard-line Cold Warrior opposed to Communism and the USSR. Carter initially wanted to nominate George Ball as Secretary of State, but he was vetoed by Brzezinski as too dovish. Vance negotiated the Panama Canal Treaties, along with peace talks in Rhodesia, Namibia and South Africa. He worked closely \n\n During this time the rest of the international communist movement was also thriving. The communist world expanded dramatically in the decade following World War II with Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, and Vietnam all becoming states dominated by their respective communist parties, usually via military victory. In the United States, Iran was seen as the holder of reserves of petroleum with \"vital strategic\" value to western countries, and as part of \"a Northern Tier\" of countries (along with Greece and Turkey) that constituted a geopolitical \"first line of defense\" for the Mediterranean and for Asia, To counter the activities of the USSR, the CIA established Operation TPBEDAMN in the late 1940s, funded at $1 million a year.\n\n"
