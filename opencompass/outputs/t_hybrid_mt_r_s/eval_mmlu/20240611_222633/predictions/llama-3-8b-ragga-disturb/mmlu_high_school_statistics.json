This study had a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover design. Subjects were all healthy Japanese adults with the ‘flusher’ phenotype for alcohol tolerance. In experiment 1, 11 subjects drank 0.4 g/kg body weight alcohol 1.5 h before their usual bedtime. Half an hour after drinking, they ingested either a placebo or 400 mg ornithine. The next morning on awakening, subjects completed a questionnaire containing a visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), and a profile of mood states (POMS) and collected a saliva sample for measurement of salivary stress markers (cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A, and α-amylase). In experiment 2, placebo or 400 mg ornithine were administrated to 16 subjects both before and after drinking, and the feeling of drunkenness, breath ethanol concentration and one-leg standing time were repeatedly investigated until 180 min after alcohol consumption. There were no differences between ornithine and placebo in any of the subjective or physiological parameters of acute alcohol metabolism. These effects were not caused by an increase in acute alcohol metabolism. Alcohol consumption transiently increases blood ammonia levels [9, 10]. Alcohol dehydrogenase, which metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which metabolizes acetaldehyde to acetic acid, play pivotal roles in degrading alcohol. In contrast, non-flushers are homozygous for wild type ALDH2 and have normal alcohol metabolism. Although moderate use of alcohol has some beneficial aspects, excessive consumption of alcohol is undoubtedly harmful to the health. Alcohol also affects psychological and physiological states. Flushers in particular tend to suffer from these negative effects due to their low ability to metabolize alcohol. Thus, simple and convenient methods for reducing the harmful effects of alcohol will be beneficial. In the present study we performed two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked cross over experiments using flushers as subjects. In experiment 1, to objectively examine the effects of 400 mg ornithine on the negative effects caused by alcohol consumption, we measured the typical salivary stress markers cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and α-amylase in addition to self-reported subjective feelings the morning after drinking. Furthermore, we investigated both the subjective and physiological effects of ornithine on acute ethanol metabolism in experiment 2. Subjects were recruited voluntarily from employees of Kirin Holdings to participate in the study. Subjects were free of medication and had no medical history of serious illness, alcohol abuse, or insomnia. All subjects signed an informed consent form after sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of this study. Alcohol sensitivity was assessed using an alcohol patch test kit (Life Care Giken, Toyama, Japan). A visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), a profile of mood states (POMS), and a drunkenness feeling test were used in this study. With a 9-point scale, regarding drunkenness, elation, swaying, weakness, and discomfort. Subjects were instructed to refrigerate sample tubes after collection and submit them to the laboratory on the morning of the study day. Subjects exhaled completely into Tedlar® gas sampling bags (As One, Tokyo, Japan). Ethanol concentrations of the breath samples were immediately assessed by ethanol detector tubes (Gastec, Kanagawa, Japan). Time before falling over was measured and the average time of 3 repetitions was determined. The study consisted of two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover experiments. The order of supplements was randomly determined for each subject and kept secret by the independent party until the data validation was completed, so that both subjects and investigators involved in the experiment were unaware of each subject’s assignment. Subjects were allowed free access to water, except during a water fasting period, but were instructed to take similar amounts of water between the trials. To eliminate the effects of the test supplements and alcohol consumed in the first trial, the second trial was performed no less than 2 days later. Experiment 1 was done in subjects’ homes. Subjects all ate the same dinner 3.5 h before their usual bed time and then rested for 2 h with no food and drink. Subjects took a saliva sample and then drank 0.4 g/kg body weight of alcohol served as beer (5% alcohol) over 0.5 h. Subjects took the capsules containing placebo or ornithine 0.5 h after drinking and went to bed after another 0.5 h. The next morning, saliva collection and questionnaires (VAS, OSA-MA and POMS) were completed just after awakening. Experiment 2 was done in the laboratory for a maximum of 5 subjects in one day. After taking the capsules, the subjects drank alcohol as in experiment 1. Subjects took the same capsules again 0.5 h after drinking and then rested for 2.5 h. They repeated the drunkenness feeling test, breath collection and one foot standing test before drinking and 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after drinking. In addition to the subjective feelings, salivary cortisol at the time of awakening was significantly decreased by ornithine administration (Figure 1). To evaluate the effects of ornithine on acute ethanol metabolism, we investigated the effects of ethanol intake on the subjective feeling of drunkenness, on breath ethanol concentrations and on one-leg standing time in experiment 2. Intake of ethanol clearly affected both subjective and physiological states immediately after drinking. We evaluated the effects of ornithine on the alcohol-induced deterioration of mood states and on salivary stress markers the morning after alcohol intake in experiment 1 and on acute ethanol metabolism in experiment 2. To be able to observe the effects of ethanol to the same degree, we decided to only screen flushers in this study. Previous studies by other groups generally used larger amounts of alcohol (0.7 to 1.6 g/kg body weight) [18–20], but the amount of alcohol consumed by flushers in our previous study (0.4 g/kg body weight) was considered appropriate to evoke the negative effects of alcohol the next morning. In experiment 1, the subjective VAS factors “awareness”, “feeling of fatigue”, and “lassitude”, the OSA-MA factor “sleep length”, and the POMS factors “anger-hostility” and “confusion” the morning after drinking were significantly improved by ornithine intake. As all subjective factors tended to be improved by ornithine intake; alcohol-derived negative feelings seemed to be improved. Considering the fact that the OSA-MA factor “sleep length” was improved but substantive sleep time was not, ornithine made the subjects feel subjectively that they slept longer, even though the actual duration was the same. In experiment 2 we aimed to clarify the influence of ornithine on acute alcohol metabolism. The feeling of drunkenness and other subjective and physiological symptoms of alcohol consumption were not significantly altered by ornithine intake. Thus, ornithine has little influence on acute alcohol metabolism at this dosage and the effect of ornithine on the alcohol-derived mood state the next morning was not caused by increased alcohol metabolism. Ammonia metabolism is disturbed by alcohol consumption , but is stimulated by ornithine administration [5, 6]. Furthermore, there is a correlation between decreased ammonia metabolism and fatigue [21, 22]. Low amounts of alcohol can aid falling asleep, whereas higher amounts of alcohol cause sleep disturbances including frequent awakening and impaired normal sleep patterns. EI assisted with the study and performed the statistical analysis. Participants are randomly assigned to different groups that either serve as controls—acting as reference points because they are tested with regard to the dependent variable, albeit without having been exposed to any independent variables of interest—or receive one or more treatments. In participant observation, \n\n Caffeine has not been shown to have an effect on a person's self-assessment of their level of alcohol intoxication. Universities have conducted studies to compare the outcomes of the consumption of regular alcoholic drinks and of caffeinated alcoholic drinks. The University of Florida surveyed 802 college students who had mixed alcohol and caffeine, and found they were three times more likely to leave a bar highly intoxicated and four times more likely to want to drink and drive than drinkers who did not consume alcoholic energy drinks. Another study surveyed 697 students from Wake Forest University and found that the students who had consumed caffeinated alcoholic drinks were more likely to drink and drive, take advantage of someone sexually, or end up needing medical treatment. From this perspective, it is inferred that caffeinated alcoholic drinks cause one to act in ways that would be less likely if one were drinking non-caffeinated alcoholic drinks. Alcohol can be a depressant which slows down some regions of the brain, like the prefrontal and temporal cortex, negatively affecting rationality and memory. The connection between the amount of alcohol intake, level of depressed mood, and how it affects the risks of experiencing consequences from alcoholism, were studied in a research done on college students. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about high school statistics.

        "context": "Residual alcohol effects on physiological and psychological symptoms are commonly experienced the morning after alcohol consumption. This study had a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover design. Subjects were all healthy Japanese adults with the ‘flusher’ phenotype for alcohol tolerance. In experiment 1, 11 subjects drank 0.4 g/kg body weight alcohol 1.5 h before their usual bedtime. Half an hour after drinking, they ingested either a placebo or 400 mg ornithine. The next morning on awakening, subjects completed a questionnaire containing a visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), and a profile of mood states (POMS) and collected a saliva sample for measurement of salivary stress markers (cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A, and α-amylase). In experiment 2, placebo or 400 mg ornithine were administrated to 16 subjects both before and after drinking, and the feeling of drunkenness, breath ethanol concentration and one-leg standing time were repeatedly investigated until 180 min after alcohol consumption. There were no differences between ornithine and placebo in any of the subjective or physiological parameters of acute alcohol metabolism. These effects were not caused by an increase in acute alcohol metabolism. Alcohol consumption transiently increases blood ammonia levels [9, 10]. Alcohol dehydrogenase, which metabolizes ethanol to acetaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), which metabolizes acetaldehyde to acetic acid, play pivotal roles in degrading alcohol. In contrast, non-flushers are homozygous for wild type ALDH2 and have normal alcohol metabolism. Although moderate use of alcohol has some beneficial aspects, excessive consumption of alcohol is undoubtedly harmful to the health. Alcohol also affects psychological and physiological states. Flushers in particular tend to suffer from these negative effects due to their low ability to metabolize alcohol. Thus, simple and convenient methods for reducing the harmful effects of alcohol will be beneficial. In the present study we performed two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked cross over experiments using flushers as subjects. In experiment 1, to objectively examine the effects of 400 mg ornithine on the negative effects caused by alcohol consumption, we measured the typical salivary stress markers cortisol, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), and α-amylase in addition to self-reported subjective feelings the morning after drinking. Furthermore, we investigated both the subjective and physiological effects of ornithine on acute ethanol metabolism in experiment 2. Subjects were recruited voluntarily from employees of Kirin Holdings to participate in the study. Subjects were free of medication and had no medical history of serious illness, alcohol abuse, or insomnia. All subjects signed an informed consent form after sufficient explanation of the purpose and design of this study. Alcohol sensitivity was assessed using an alcohol patch test kit (Life Care Giken, Toyama, Japan). A visual analog scale (VAS), the Oguri-Shirakawa-Azumi sleep inventory MA version (OSA-MA), a profile of mood states (POMS), and a drunkenness feeling test were used in this study. With a 9-point scale, regarding drunkenness, elation, swaying, weakness, and discomfort. Subjects were instructed to refrigerate sample tubes after collection and submit them to the laboratory on the morning of the study day. Subjects exhaled completely into Tedlar® gas sampling bags (As One, Tokyo, Japan). Ethanol concentrations of the breath samples were immediately assessed by ethanol detector tubes (Gastec, Kanagawa, Japan). Time before falling over was measured and the average time of 3 repetitions was determined. The study consisted of two randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked crossover experiments. The order of supplements was randomly determined for each subject and kept secret by the independent party until the data validation was completed, so that both subjects and investigators involved in the experiment were unaware of each subject’s assignment. Subjects were allowed free access to water, except during a water fasting period, but were instructed to take similar amounts of water between the trials. To eliminate the effects of the test supplements and alcohol consumed in the first trial, the second trial was performed no less than 2 days later. Experiment 1 was done in subjects’ homes. Subjects all ate the same dinner 3.5 h before their usual bed time and then rested for 2 h with no food and drink. Subjects took a saliva sample and then drank 0.4 g/kg body weight of alcohol served as beer (5% alcohol) over 0.5 h. Subjects took the capsules containing placebo or ornithine 0.5 h after drinking and went to bed after another 0.5 h. The next morning, saliva collection and questionnaires (VAS, OSA-MA and POMS) were completed just after awakening. Experiment 2 was done in the laboratory for a maximum of 5 subjects in one day. After taking the capsules, the subjects drank alcohol as in experiment 1. Subjects took the same capsules again 0.5 h after drinking and then rested for 2.5 h. They repeated the drunkenness feeling test, breath collection and one foot standing test before drinking and 0, 30, 60, 120 and 180 min after drinking.

In a hypothesis test, the level of significance (often set at 5%) represents the threshold at which the null hypothesis is rejected. A lower level of significance would make it more difficult to reject the null hypothesis. Conversely, a higher level of significance would make it easier to reject the null hypothesis. By reducing the likelihood of committing a type II error, the study becomes more sensitive to detecting true effects. Another option is to reduce variability in the data, possibly through stricter inclusion criteria or improved measurement techniques.\n\n"

The inclusion criteria were the patients of all age groups who have had only one myocardial infarction, patients who on the previous day of the survey were not hospitalized for other illnesses, did not have any other systemic disease, neurological disease, cardiac valvular defect, and polyvascular atherosclerotic disease, and did not have diagnosed mental illness. Patients with lethal outcome, patients who for any reason did not want to participate in the study, and patients who have had more than one myocardial infarction were excluded from the study. In the groups II and III, the patients were treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) [who immediately after incident underwent primary PCI (pPCI) or delayed PCI], and each group consisted of 40 patients. The group IV consisted of 40 patients who underwent surgical revascularization (coronary artery bypass surgery). The measurements included interventricular septum thickness, the thickness of the back wall of the left ventricle (LV), diameter of the left ventricular internal dimension in end-diastole (LVIDd) and left ventricular internal dimension in end-systole (LVIDs), ejection fraction (EF), and an overview of the valvular apparatus of the heart. These examinations were performed by two physicians (to reduce the interobserver and intraobserver errors if any) who were not familiar with the inclusion or exclusion criteria and did not know one another. The study used the Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaire for the QoL testing, and clinical data were obtained from the patient’s history. Furthermore, the SF-36 has 8-scaled scores. Sections are given as follows: vitality, physical functioning, bodily pain, general health perceptions, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, social role functioning, and mental health. Research results were analyzed using the descriptive statistics, which includes the determination of the mean, standard deviation, and standard error of mean, or the median and interquartile ranking. The following methods of analytical statistics have been used: the methods of empirical distribution identification, methods for assessing the statistical significance (chi-square test, Student’s t-test, one-way analysis of variance, Mann–Whitney test, and Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance). Methods, which were used for assessing the significance of relations, were the Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient and Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. To assess the impact of these factors on the QoL, we used the Cox model of univariate and multivariate analyses. The statistical significance was on the level of P < 0.05. An analysis of gender distribution showed that men were more represented than women in all the groups as well as in the total sample. PCI was applied slightly more often among men (34 patients − 85%) in the group III compared to the group II (32 patients−80%), but without statistically significant differences in the application of PCI by gender in the observed groups. Within the examinees in the group I, a statistically significant effect of smoking on any particular scale was not recorded. In the group II, there has been a positive influence on the scale of emotional role (P = 0.025) and negative on the scale of general health (P = 0.013). In the case of the group III, negative impact is recorded on the scale of physical functioning (P = 0.012), physical role (P = 0.013), emotional role (P = 0.026), and social functioning (P = 0.036), and in the group IV, positive impact on the scale of physical functioning (P = 0.002), mental health (P = 0.028), and general health (P = 0.031). The comparison of correlation coefficients between the groups shows that there are significant differences in almost all scales except on the scale of vitality and pain [Table 4]. The negative impact of total cholesterol was observed only in the group II on the physical role scale (P = 0.004), and in the group III on the scale of pain (P = 0.038), a statistically significant difference between the groups was observed only on the scale of physical role in relation to the groups (χ2 = 9.98; P = 0.841). Positive correlation in the group III was found to the scale of vitality (P = 0.002), mental health (P = 0.033), and social functioning (P = 0.021). The comparison of correlation coefficients between the groups shows that there is a significant difference at all scales (P < 0.05). In the group I, such an impact was significant to the physical role (P = 0.006), emotional role (P = 0.023), vitality (P = 0.000), and social functioning (P = 0.003). In the case of the group II to physical functioning (P = 0.035), physical role (P = 0.010), and vitality (P = 0.033), and in the case of the group III to pain (P = 0.034) and general health (P = 0.047). The comparison between groups of correlation coefficients shows that there is a significant difference in physical role (χ2 = 18.86; P < 0.01). In the group III, a negative correlation was registered to LVIDs (P = 0.012) and positive toward EF (P = 0.040), whereas in the group IV, a positive correlation was recorded toward the size of the left atrium (P = 0.002) [Table 5]. In the group IV, a positive correlation was observed to EF (P = 0.038), and negative toward the mitral regurgitation (P = 0.032). In the group II, there was a positive impact on the vitality (r = 0.373; P = 0.018) and social functioning (r = 0.414; P = 0.008), whereas in the group III, a negative impact on the scale of pain score was recorded (r = 0.312; P = 0.050). The comparison of correlation coefficients between the groups shows that there is a significant difference between the scales of physical role (P = 0.007), vitality (P = 0.005), social functioning (P = 0.000), and pain (P = 0.025) [Table 7]. Our study did not find a significant effect of age on the QoL in investigated patients, although higher scores were found in specific age groups showing that younger patients have higher scores. The highest overall score of life quality comprised the patients of the group II and the worst patients of the group I. With the increase of hypertension degree, there was a reduction in the QoL scores only in the group III. Associations between smoking and the QoL within the groups showed a significant difference in all subscales except vitality and pain. Higher BGLs were mainly associated with a reduced QoL in all the observed subscales. The correlation between BGLs and the scores of the QoL showed that there was a significant difference in the scales of physical role, vitality, social functioning, and pain. The results of EUROASPIRE III study published in 2013, on a sample of 8734 patients from 22 European countries, and with a history of acute myocardial infarction, showed that PCI and coronary artery bypass graft were correlating with the QoL and lifestyle risk factors. It was noted that the lower QoL scores had women, older patients, and those with lower levels of education. Research, conducted in Norway during 2007 on a sample of 120 patients with an average age of 40 years and EF greater than 30%, tested the QoL before and after bypass surgery.
