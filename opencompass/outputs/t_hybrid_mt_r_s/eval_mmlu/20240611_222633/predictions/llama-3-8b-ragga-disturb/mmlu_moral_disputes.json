Hare put this point by saying that the supervenience base of a moral fact could not include \"individual constants\" (including proper names of persons, countries, etc.) One could of course claim that the fact that Brenda is called Brenda, or is a woman rather than a man, is relevant to the morality of her killing; while implausible, this claim would not be ruled out by the principle of moral supervenience, but by other more substantive moral principles. ), then if the principle of moral supervenience is true, then any other killing where those same non-moral facts are true has the same moral properties as Brenda's killing of Charles. For instance, it is not possible for Brenda's killing of Charles to be right, and Sam's killing of \n\n The principle is compatible with a very fine-grained analysis of the supervenience base for moral predicates, and hence is compatible with moral particularism, which claims that whatever non-moral facts make a certain action right or wrong, it is possible that some additional non-moral facts could change that non-moral fact again. For instance, in the above example, Brenda's having been previously enslaved by Charles might making killing him permissible; but if Brenda has been a terrorist imprisoned by Charles to prevent her from committing more violence, then her killing him would instead be impermissible. This view has been much criticized, however, on the grounds that it involves \"rule-worship\" which forbids us from performing such behaviors precisely when they are harmless or even beneficial, just because they would be less beneficial in circumstances which we know we are not in, and that an adequate response (justified by a UA test) is to follow the slightly more but not unmanageable complex rule of usually telling the truth, but lying just when doing so will definitely produce more good than telling the truth. Considerations of the aforementioned need to handle evil-doers has also motivated some defenders of ideal rule consequentialism to\n\n"
