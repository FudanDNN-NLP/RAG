This study involved six control subjects and six subjects with type 2 diabetes, who underwent a hyperinsulinaemic (0.5 mU kg(-1) min(-1)), hyperglycaemic clamp to increase muscle malonyl-CoA and inhibit fat oxidation. The researchers utilized stable isotope methods, femoral arterial and venous catheterization, and muscle biopsies to measure palmitate kinetics across the leg and muscle malonyl-CoA levels. Interestingly, despite the elevation of muscle malonyl-CoA, there was no significant difference observed in the dysregulation of muscle fatty acid metabolism between the control and type 2 diabetes subjects. Therefore, it appears that the dysregulation of muscle fatty acid metabolism in type 2 diabetes is not directly dependent on muscle malonyl-CoA levels. This suggests that factors other than malonyl-CoA may be involved in shunting fatty acids away from oxidation and towards storage in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Overall, this study highlights the complex nature of muscle fatty acid metabolism in type 2 diabetes, indicating that there are underlying mechanisms beyond malonyl-CoA that contribute to the dysregulation of this process. Insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes: association with truncal obesity, impaired fitness, and atypical malonyl coenzyme A regulation. Likewise, sustained increases in the concentration of malonyl coenzyme A (CoA), an inhibitor of fatty-acid oxidation, have been observed in muscle in association with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes in various rodents. In addition, during the high-dose insulin clamp, the increase in cytosolic citrate and malate in muscle, which parallels and regulates malonyl CoA levels, was significantly less in the diabetic patients (P < 0.05 vs. P < 0.001). Despite this, a similar increase in the concentration of malonyl CoA was observed in the two groups, suggesting an abnormality in malonyl CoA regulation in the diabetic subjects. Whether the unexpectedly high levels of malonyl CoA in muscle, together with the diminished suppression of plasma free fatty acid, explains the insulin resistance of the diabetic patients during the clamp remains to be determined. In gluconeogenesis, the enzyme cPEPCK (cystolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase) is responsible for converting oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvic acid, or PEP, when guanosine triphosphate, GTP, is present.

Toxic multinodular goiter is a condition characterized by the presence of multiple thyroid nodules that become overactive and produce excessive amounts of thyroid hormones.

As was correctly detected by Bojo Shestich, LMT, MMT, the patient’s anterior scalene muscle slightly irritated part of the brachial plexus, which gives origin to the axillary nerve, and it was the real cause of his shoulder pain. This case greatly illustrates that the anterior scalene muscle, which has the nickname “the silent killer” may trigger any possible symptoms on the upper extremity that, from the first look, seemed completely unrelated since the patient did not complain about any pain on the neck. During the summer of 2011, the patient came into the office with acute pain in the right shoulder and restriction of ROM. Four months before his first visit to our clinic, the patient started to feel pain in the right shoulder especially after roping practice. After two weeks, the patient’s pain intensity did not change much, and he went through ten sessions of physical therapy. The patient was referred to an orthopedic surgeon who ordered a shoulder MRI. The MRI showed a complete tear of the rotator cuff with 2cm retraction of supraspinatus muscle’s tendon with significant atrophy of the entire muscle’s belly. It was suggested to the patient to have extensive surgery to rebuild the rotator cuff and re-attach the damaged supraspinatus muscle to its anatomical location. Examination of the right shoulder showed that, indeed, he had acute pain on the lateral side of the right shoulder during active abduction. The pain started approximately at 70 degrees of abduction, and the patient had a tendency to bend the upper body to the left while trying to further elevate his right arm. Also he had acute pain on the anterior shoulder while trying to put his right arm behind his back. The palpatory examination indicated the presence of active trigger points in the middle and anterior portions of the right deltoid muscle. He also exhibited mild-to-moderate pain on the top of the right shoulder when pressure was applied on the right acromio-clavicular joint. Considering that this indicated a potential nerve involvement, I decided to examine the posterior cervical muscles and anterior scalene muscle. He did not exhibit significant tension in the posterior neck, and the application of pressure on the tip or sides of the spinous processes did not trigger any uncomfortable sensations. However, as soon as I applied Wartenburg’s Test to examine the anterior scalene muscle, the patient “jumped” and said that pain was shooting to his right shoulder and right arm all way to the elbow. In considering my findings, I decided to use the protocol for the Anterior Scalene Muscle to rule out compression of the nerves on the anterior neck by the scalene muscles before I began work on the shoulder itself. Starting with the fourth session, I combined the protocol for the Anterior Scalene Muscle Syndrome with the Deltoid Muscle Syndrome protocol. SITS muscles is an abbreviation for this group of muscles with reference to the first letter of their names (Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor and Subscapularis). The muscles originate from the scapula and connect to the head of the humerus, forming a cuff at the glenohumeral joint. Supraspinatus is a small muscle which originates from medial two-thirds of the supraspinous fossa of the scapula and is inserted into the greater tubercle of the humerus. The Teres minor muscle originates from the upper two-thirds of the lateral border of the scapula and is inserted into the inferior facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The subscapularis muscle is a bulky triangular muscle originates from medial two-thirds of the costal surface of the scapula and is inserted into the lesser tubercle of the humerus. External rotation, internal rotation, flexion and abduction are different types of upper extremity movements that are carried out by the rotator cuff muscles. They hold the head of the humerus into the small glenoid fossa of the scapula to facilitate the range of motion in the glenohumeral joint and avoid mechanical obstruction. Chronic overuse, acute injury or gradual aging can cause some serious damage to any one or all of the muscles as well as the ligaments that act as an attachment between the muscles and bone. The muscles find it difficult to carry out small adjustments within the joint that facilitates the humeral head to move smoothly. Collection of fluid within the joint due to inflammation causes the movements to limit. There are narrow bony spaces through which the tendons run, and any change in the movement of the humerus and scapula can cause these spaces to become even narrower. These calcifications may occur along the bony edges of the joint or within the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles. Pain develops slowly and gets worse with lifting the arm to the side or turning it inward. Some nonsurgical treatments can also be used rotator cuff injuries, including steroid injections to decrease inflammation in the tight spaces where the muscle tendons run across the shoulder joint, therapeutic ultrasound, shockwave therapy, and dry needling. To stop this compressing against the undersurface of the acromion the humeral head and injuring the supraspinatus tendon, there is a simultaneous contraction of some of the muscles of the rotator cuff: the infraspinatus and subscapularis primarily perform this role. In spite of this there may be still a 1–3 mm upward movement of the head of the humerus during the first 30° to 60° of arm elevation.

His knee was tender to palpation. What knee structures are most likely injured? What skeletal and muscular components are involved in the injury? * * *\n\n### ANSWER TO CASE 55:\n\n#### Knee Injury\n\n_Summary:_ A 19-year-old male with no past medical history is tackled during a football game and is complaining of pain in his right knee after hearing a \"popping sound.\" His gait is unstable and he has instability in his knee with twisting motion. • **Knee structures likely injured:** Anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and medial meniscus. • **Skeletal components involved:** Patella, femur, and tibia. There are no muscles directly involved with this type of injury. ### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\nThe unhappy triad consists of damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and medial meniscus and is common among sports injuries when a player is tackled with great force such as in football, rugby, or soccer. This athlete was playing in a football game and was otherwise healthy.Along with this, the sudden inward twisting of the knee with the foot planted causes a strain on the ACL.Hearing a popping sound is a very common symptom with injury to the ACL.The patient's unstable gait and instability in twisting motion from side to side further confirm the suspicion that he damaged ligaments in the unhappy triad. The examination starts with inspection, followed by active and passive mobilization and isometric muscle testing. The tenderest point of the knee should be examined last to prevent a guarding reaction from the patient due to pain. The knee is composed of 4 bones: the femur, tibia, fibula and patella. The distal end is wider and forms a double condyle that articulates with the tibia and patella. The tibia articulates with the distal lateral and medial femoral condyles. The patella articulates anteriorly to the femoral condyles in the region of the intercondylar fossa (trochlear groove). The ligaments of the knee joint can be divided into the extracapsular ligaments and intra-articular ligaments. The extracapsular ligaments or external ligaments are the patellar ligament, medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCLs), oblique popliteal ligament, and arcuate popliteal ligament. The intra-articular ligaments are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the posterior meniscofemoral ligament. The patient should be asked to take off shoes, socks, and pants in order to get a good view of the knee and bony reference points of the pelvis. Patient preparation for knee examination. Ligaments in and around the knee keep it in a stable position. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) provides lateral stability and runs from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevents anterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevents posterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur. The cruciate ligaments are also important for internal rotation stability of the knee. The posterolateral corner (PLC) is a complex stabilization unit on the posterolateral side of the knee and prevents dorsal displacement of the lateral tibial plateau (ie, exorotation of the tibia with respect to the femur, lateral instability, and hyperextension). Stability testing is based on trying to mobilize the tibia with respect to the femur in the direction that is limited when the tested ligament is intact. Position of the patella can be checked and provides information on rotational disorders of the leg. Inspection from the lateral side can show a flexion deformity when the knee cannot be fully extended or a recurvatum deformity when the knee can be hyperextended beyond neutral position. A gait assessment should be performed while the patient walks. Also, flexion and extension of the knee are watched, as well as mediolateral stability. When a varus thrust is observed during stance phase, an increased varus deformity is present. The knee is observed, with special attention to scar tissue, lacerations, and hematoma due to trauma or previous operations. Intraarticular effusion can be seen as a swelling in the region proximal of the patella. The normal aspect of the distal quadriceps is not visible anymore. Swelling in the anterior of the patella is often due to a prepatellar bursitis. The color of the knee is checked and compared to the other side. Muscle atrophy of the quadriceps and abnormalities of the patellar ligament or Hoffa’s fat tissue can also be observed. Inspection with the patient in dorsal decubitus position. The patient is asked to fully extend and flex the knee, as shown in the images below. Normal range of motion varies, but a range from full extension to a flexion of 140 degrees is normally possible. When the knee cannot be fully extended, an extension deficit or a flexion contracture is present. When the knee can extend beyond full extension, hyperextension is present. Rotation in the knee is checked with the knee flexed to exclude hip rotations. The examiner should mobilize the leg and again check the function. During movement of the knee, crepitus or patellar clunking can be palpated. Checking rotation of the knee in passive mobilization. Hip rotation also should be checked because some hip problems express themselves as knee pain. The patient should sit on the examination table with the lower legs hanging down and the knee in 90 degrees flexion. The patient is asked to extend and flex the knee while the examiner holds the knee in a steady position. Examiner holds the knee in a steady position for isometric muscle testing. Gastrocnemius: flexion of the knee, plantar flexion of the foot. Normal anatomic landmarks such as the patella, the epicondyles, the joint lines, the tibial plateau, tibial tuberosity, Gerdy’s tubercle, and proximal fibula can be palpated and tenderness of anatomic structures should be assessed. Soft tissues like the quadriceps muscle, anserine bursa, Hoffa’s fat pad, iliotibial tract, patellar ligament and lateral and medial collateral ligaments can be assessed by palpation. Intraarticular effusion fluctuates and can be pushed from lateral to medial and back under the patella. This is especially important after high-energy trauma to the knee with resultant dislocation of the joint. Meniscal testing is based on trying to subluxate the torn meniscus by applying compression and rotation forces on the knee and palpating the snap when it jumps back to the normal position. Palpation of the anterior or posterior joint line is tender when a meniscal tear is present. A resilient extension deficit is present when a part of the torn meniscus luxates and mechanically blocks further range of motion. The knee cannot be extended and the stop is resilient. This clinical sign is most often associated with a bucket handle rupture of one of the menisci. During hyperflexion, the posterior part of the meniscus is subject to severe load forces. The patient is asked to squat or a passive hyperflexion of the knee is performed. When these maneuvers are painful, a posterior horn lesion of the meniscus is likely to be present. Passive hyperflexion of the knee. Patient in a squatting position for a hyperflexion test. During slow extension of the knee while maintaining the valgus stress and external rotation, a snap on the medial joint line may be palpated; this indicates a positive test for a medial meniscal tear. McMurray test: The medial meniscus is tested by passive flexion, valgus stress, and external rotation of the lower leg. During slow extension of the knee while maintaining varus stress and internal rotation, a snap on the lateral joint line may be palpated; this indicates a positive test for a lateral meniscal tear. McMurray test: The lateral meniscus is tested by passive flexion, varus stress, and internal rotation of the lower leg. The knee is passively flexed 90 degrees. Thessaly test to simulate the loading forces placed upon the knee. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for valgus stress. With one hand on the lateral side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an abduction force is gently applied, as shown in the image below. The intact LCL can be palpated as a taut band from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. This can be best performed with the ipsilateral heel placed on the contralateral knee while the knee flexed and the hip is flexed and exorotated. Peroneal nerve dysfunction should be assessed. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for varus stress. With one hand on the medial side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an adduction force is gently applied. In the acute injury, hemarthrosis is mostly present. This may limit knee flexion, whereas torn fibers of the ACL can mechanically prevent full extension. The hip is flexed 45 degrees, the knee is passively held in 90 degrees of flexion with the tibia in neutral rotation, and the patient is asked to relax. The examiner stabilizes the lower extremity by gently sitting on the foot. The hamstrings are checked for slackness and a gentle anterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. Posterior drawer test and the gravity sign or tibial step of sign should be assessed to differentiate. The sensitivity and specificity of the anterior drawer test for anterior cruciate ruptures ranges broadly, from 9–93% and 23–100%, respectively, with means of 62% and 67%. The pivot shift test evaluates the anterolateral rotational laxity that is present in the ACL-deficient knee. One hand holds the ankle and the other one the lateral side of the lower leg just below the knee. The knee is now slowly extended. An anterior sliding or jerking of the lateral tibia plateau indicates the test is positive. This anterior translation is caused by the fact that the iliotibial band, which creates a posteriorly directed force on the tibial plateau in flexion and an anteriorly directed force in extension, subluxates the tibial plateau anteriorly in the ACL-deficient knee when it passes the center of rotation. In the acute injury, hemarthrosis is mostly present. This may limit knee function. The hip is flexed 45 degrees and the knee is passively held in 90 degrees of flexion with the tibia in neutral rotation. The examiner stabilizes the lower extremity by gently sitting on the foot. A gentle posterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. When the tibia moves posterior with respect to the femur, the test is positive and a PCL deficiency present. Due to the gravitational force, the tibia in the PCL-deficient knee will subluxate posteriorly with respect to the femur. The tibial tuberosity will be less prominent. Depending on the position of the knee, isometric quadriceps contraction provides an anterior tibial shear force, no tibial shear force, or a posterior shear force. The position of the knee in which no tibial shear forces are present is called the quadriceps neutral angle. This angle is determined in the contralateral knee. In this test, the injured knee is put in the same angle and the patient is asked to contract the quadriceps. In a PCL-deficient knee, the tibia is at this moment in a more posterior position and thus an anterior tibial shear force will be present during contraction of the quadriceps. Thus the knee will be reduced to normal, which can be observed as an anterior translation. On inspection, laceration, ecchymosis, or localized swelling can be seen over the LCL, PLC, or anteromedial because a blow at anteromedial can cause PLC deficiency due to hyperextension. The intact LCL can be palpated as a taut band from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. This can be best performed with the ipsilateral heel placed on the contralateral knee while the knee flexed and the hip is flexed and exorotated. The patient is asked to relax and both knees are exorotated, as shown in the image below. When the test is positive it is repeated with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. An increased exorotation when compared to the test with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion indicates an associated PCL deficiency. The knee is flexed 30 degrees and the angle between the axis of the foot and thigh is compared to the contralateral side, as shown in the image below. External rotation thigh foot angle test for posterolateral corner instability. When the test is positive, it is repeated with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. An increased exorotation when compared to the test with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion indicates an associated PCL deficiency. The patient is in a supine position with the knee in extension. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for varus stress. With one hand on the medial side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an adduction force is gently applied. The hip is flexed 45 degrees and the knee 80 degrees. The tibia is externally rotated 15 degrees. In this position, a gentle posterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. In the PLC-deficient knee, the lateral tibial plateau rotates externally with respect to the femur and no firm stop is present. The knee is flexed 90 degrees. A valgus force and an external rotational force are applied to the knee. In the PLC-deficient knee, the lateral tibial plateau is subluxated posteriorly by this maneuver. The knee is now slowly extended. An anterior jerking of the lateral tibia plateau is caused by reduction to neutral position of the lateral tibial plateau and indicates the test is positive. Due to the direction of forces produced by the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon, the patella tends to luxate laterally. Normally, it remains in position due to the bony form of the femoral trochlea and the medial retinaculum. When these are insufficient or the forces in lateral direction are increased, a patellar luxation is possible. When the patella is not seen or palpated at its normal position in the femoral trochlea but more lateral, a luxation is present. It spontaneously reduces when the leg is passively extended. The medial side of the patella is often tender also due to this laceration, but the lateral part of the patella can also be tender due to trauma of the bony lateral restraints. Assessing the Q angle for patellar instability. In flexion, the Q angle normally decreases due to the internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur during flexion. Increased valgus load axis, increased femoral anteversion, or lateral position of the tibial tuberosity increases the Q angle and with it the forces in lateral direction on the patella. The knee is flexed 20 degrees and a gentle force in lateral direction is applied to the medial side of the patella. Patellar subluxation test for patellar instability. Due to the direction of forces produced by the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon, the patella tends to luxate laterally. Normally it remains in position due to the bony form of the femoral trochlea and the medial retinaculum. This can create a local overload of the cartilage of the patellofemoral joint, which can be painful. Patellofemoral pain is not associated with intraarticular effusion. Palpation of the cartilage on the medial or lateral side of the patella can be very painful. The Q angle is defined as the angle between the line from the spina iliaca anterior superior to the center of the patella and the patellar tendon in the frontal plane, as shown in the image below. In flexion, the Q angle normally decreases due to the internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur during flexion. Increased valgus load axis, increased femoral anteversion, or lateral position of tibial tuberosity increases the Q angle and with it the forces in lateral direction on the patella. The knee is in extension. The patella is palpated on the proximal side and held in position while the patient is asked to contract the quadriceps. The test is positive when this quadriceps contraction is painful. Physical examination and imaging of the lateral collateral ligament and posterolateral corner of the knee.

There are no muscles directly involved with this type of injury. ### CLINICAL CORRELATION\n\nThe unhappy triad consists of damage to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), medial collateral ligament (MCL), and medial meniscus and is common among sports injuries when a player is tackled with great force such as in football, rugby, or soccer. This athlete was playing in a football game and was otherwise healthy.Along with this, the sudden inward twisting of the knee with the foot planted causes a strain on the ACL.Hearing a popping sound is a very common symptom with injury to the ACL.The patient's unstable gait and instability in twisting motion from side to side further confirm the suspicion that he damaged ligaments in the unhappy triad. The examination starts with inspection, followed by active and passive mobilization and isometric muscle testing. The tenderest point of the knee should be examined last to prevent a guarding reaction from the patient due to pain. The knee is composed of 4 bones: the femur, tibia, fibula and patella. The distal end is wider and forms a double condyle that articulates with the tibia and patella. The tibia articulates with the distal lateral and medial femoral condyles. The patella articulates anteriorly to the femoral condyles in the region of the intercondylar fossa (trochlear groove). The ligaments of the knee joint can be divided into the extracapsular ligaments and intra-articular ligaments. The extracapsular ligaments or external ligaments are the patellar ligament, medial collateral ligament (MCL), lateral collateral ligament (LCLs), oblique popliteal ligament, and arcuate popliteal ligament. The intra-articular ligaments are the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and the posterior meniscofemoral ligament. The patient should be asked to take off shoes, socks, and pants in order to get a good view of the knee and bony reference points of the pelvis. Patient preparation for knee examination. Ligaments in and around the knee keep it in a stable position. The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) provides lateral stability and runs from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) prevents anterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) prevents posterior displacement of the tibia with respect to the femur. The cruciate ligaments are also important for internal rotation stability of the knee. The posterolateral corner (PLC) is a complex stabilization unit on the posterolateral side of the knee and prevents dorsal displacement of the lateral tibial plateau (ie, exorotation of the tibia with respect to the femur, lateral instability, and hyperextension). Stability testing is based on trying to mobilize the tibia with respect to the femur in the direction that is limited when the tested ligament is intact. Position of the patella can be checked and provides information on rotational disorders of the leg. Inspection from the lateral side can show a flexion deformity when the knee cannot be fully extended or a recurvatum deformity when the knee can be hyperextended beyond neutral position. A gait assessment should be performed while the patient walks. Also, flexion and extension of the knee are watched, as well as mediolateral stability. When a varus thrust is observed during stance phase, an increased varus deformity is present. The knee is observed, with special attention to scar tissue, lacerations, and hematoma due to trauma or previous operations. Intraarticular effusion can be seen as a swelling in the region proximal of the patella. The normal aspect of the distal quadriceps is not visible anymore. Swelling in the anterior of the patella is often due to a prepatellar bursitis. The color of the knee is checked and compared to the other side. Muscle atrophy of the quadriceps and abnormalities of the patellar ligament or Hoffa’s fat tissue can also be observed. Inspection with the patient in dorsal decubitus position. The patient is asked to fully extend and flex the knee, as shown in the images below. Normal range of motion varies, but a range from full extension to a flexion of 140 degrees is normally possible. When the knee cannot be fully extended, an extension deficit or a flexion contracture is present. When the knee can extend beyond full extension, hyperextension is present. Rotation in the knee is checked with the knee flexed to exclude hip rotations. The examiner should mobilize the leg and again check the function. During movement of the knee, crepitus or patellar clunking can be palpated. Checking rotation of the knee in passive mobilization. Hip rotation also should be checked because some hip problems express themselves as knee pain. The patient should sit on the examination table with the lower legs hanging down and the knee in 90 degrees flexion. The patient is asked to extend and flex the knee while the examiner holds the knee in a steady position. Examiner holds the knee in a steady position for isometric muscle testing. Gastrocnemius: flexion of the knee, plantar flexion of the foot. Normal anatomic landmarks such as the patella, the epicondyles, the joint lines, the tibial plateau, tibial tuberosity, Gerdy’s tubercle, and proximal fibula can be palpated and tenderness of anatomic structures should be assessed. Soft tissues like the quadriceps muscle, anserine bursa, Hoffa’s fat pad, iliotibial tract, patellar ligament and lateral and medial collateral ligaments can be assessed by palpation. Intraarticular effusion fluctuates and can be pushed from lateral to medial and back under the patella. This is especially important after high-energy trauma to the knee with resultant dislocation of the joint. Meniscal testing is based on trying to subluxate the torn meniscus by applying compression and rotation forces on the knee and palpating the snap when it jumps back to the normal position. Palpation of the anterior or posterior joint line is tender when a meniscal tear is present. A resilient extension deficit is present when a part of the torn meniscus luxates and mechanically blocks further range of motion. The knee cannot be extended and the stop is resilient. This clinical sign is most often associated with a bucket handle rupture of one of the menisci. During hyperflexion, the posterior part of the meniscus is subject to severe load forces. The patient is asked to squat or a passive hyperflexion of the knee is performed. When these maneuvers are painful, a posterior horn lesion of the meniscus is likely to be present. Passive hyperflexion of the knee. Patient in a squatting position for a hyperflexion test. During slow extension of the knee while maintaining the valgus stress and external rotation, a snap on the medial joint line may be palpated; this indicates a positive test for a medial meniscal tear. McMurray test: The medial meniscus is tested by passive flexion, valgus stress, and external rotation of the lower leg. During slow extension of the knee while maintaining varus stress and internal rotation, a snap on the lateral joint line may be palpated; this indicates a positive test for a lateral meniscal tear. McMurray test: The lateral meniscus is tested by passive flexion, varus stress, and internal rotation of the lower leg. The knee is passively flexed 90 degrees. Thessaly test to simulate the loading forces placed upon the knee. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for valgus stress. With one hand on the lateral side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an abduction force is gently applied, as shown in the image below. The intact LCL can be palpated as a taut band from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. This can be best performed with the ipsilateral heel placed on the contralateral knee while the knee flexed and the hip is flexed and exorotated. Peroneal nerve dysfunction should be assessed. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for varus stress. With one hand on the medial side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an adduction force is gently applied. In the acute injury, hemarthrosis is mostly present. This may limit knee flexion, whereas torn fibers of the ACL can mechanically prevent full extension. The hip is flexed 45 degrees, the knee is passively held in 90 degrees of flexion with the tibia in neutral rotation, and the patient is asked to relax. The examiner stabilizes the lower extremity by gently sitting on the foot. The hamstrings are checked for slackness and a gentle anterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. Posterior drawer test and the gravity sign or tibial step of sign should be assessed to differentiate. The sensitivity and specificity of the anterior drawer test for anterior cruciate ruptures ranges broadly, from 9–93% and 23–100%, respectively, with means of 62% and 67%. The pivot shift test evaluates the anterolateral rotational laxity that is present in the ACL-deficient knee. One hand holds the ankle and the other one the lateral side of the lower leg just below the knee. The knee is now slowly extended. An anterior sliding or jerking of the lateral tibia plateau indicates the test is positive. This anterior translation is caused by the fact that the iliotibial band, which creates a posteriorly directed force on the tibial plateau in flexion and an anteriorly directed force in extension, subluxates the tibial plateau anteriorly in the ACL-deficient knee when it passes the center of rotation. In the acute injury, hemarthrosis is mostly present. This may limit knee function. The hip is flexed 45 degrees and the knee is passively held in 90 degrees of flexion with the tibia in neutral rotation. The examiner stabilizes the lower extremity by gently sitting on the foot. A gentle posterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. When the tibia moves posterior with respect to the femur, the test is positive and a PCL deficiency present. Due to the gravitational force, the tibia in the PCL-deficient knee will subluxate posteriorly with respect to the femur. The tibial tuberosity will be less prominent. Depending on the position of the knee, isometric quadriceps contraction provides an anterior tibial shear force, no tibial shear force, or a posterior shear force. The position of the knee in which no tibial shear forces are present is called the quadriceps neutral angle. This angle is determined in the contralateral knee. In this test, the injured knee is put in the same angle and the patient is asked to contract the quadriceps. In a PCL-deficient knee, the tibia is at this moment in a more posterior position and thus an anterior tibial shear force will be present during contraction of the quadriceps. Thus the knee will be reduced to normal, which can be observed as an anterior translation. On inspection, laceration, ecchymosis, or localized swelling can be seen over the LCL, PLC, or anteromedial because a blow at anteromedial can cause PLC deficiency due to hyperextension. The intact LCL can be palpated as a taut band from the lateral femoral epicondyl to the fibular head. This can be best performed with the ipsilateral heel placed on the contralateral knee while the knee flexed and the hip is flexed and exorotated. The patient is asked to relax and both knees are exorotated, as shown in the image below. When the test is positive it is repeated with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. An increased exorotation when compared to the test with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion indicates an associated PCL deficiency. The knee is flexed 30 degrees and the angle between the axis of the foot and thigh is compared to the contralateral side, as shown in the image below. External rotation thigh foot angle test for posterolateral corner instability. When the test is positive, it is repeated with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. An increased exorotation when compared to the test with the knee in 30 degrees of flexion indicates an associated PCL deficiency. The patient is in a supine position with the knee in extension. In extension, the posterior capsule and cruciate ligaments act as secondary restraints for varus stress. With one hand on the medial side of the knee and one hand on the ankle, an adduction force is gently applied. The hip is flexed 45 degrees and the knee 80 degrees. The tibia is externally rotated 15 degrees. In this position, a gentle posterior force to the proximal tibia is applied. In the PLC-deficient knee, the lateral tibial plateau rotates externally with respect to the femur and no firm stop is present. The knee is flexed 90 degrees. A valgus force and an external rotational force are applied to the knee. In the PLC-deficient knee, the lateral tibial plateau is subluxated posteriorly by this maneuver. The knee is now slowly extended. An anterior jerking of the lateral tibia plateau is caused by reduction to neutral position of the lateral tibial plateau and indicates the test is positive. Due to the direction of forces produced by the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon, the patella tends to luxate laterally. Normally, it remains in position due to the bony form of the femoral trochlea and the medial retinaculum. When these are insufficient or the forces in lateral direction are increased, a patellar luxation is possible. When the patella is not seen or palpated at its normal position in the femoral trochlea but more lateral, a luxation is present. It spontaneously reduces when the leg is passively extended. The medial side of the patella is often tender also due to this laceration, but the lateral part of the patella can also be tender due to trauma of the bony lateral restraints. Assessing the Q angle for patellar instability. In flexion, the Q angle normally decreases due to the internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur during flexion. Increased valgus load axis, increased femoral anteversion, or lateral position of the tibial tuberosity increases the Q angle and with it the forces in lateral direction on the patella. The knee is flexed 20 degrees and a gentle force in lateral direction is applied to the medial side of the patella. Patellar subluxation test for patellar instability. Due to the direction of forces produced by the quadriceps muscle and patellar tendon, the patella tends to luxate laterally. Normally it remains in position due to the bony form of the femoral trochlea and the medial retinaculum. This can create a local overload of the cartilage of the patellofemoral joint, which can be painful. Patellofemoral pain is not associated with intraarticular effusion. Palpation of the cartilage on the medial or lateral side of the patella can be very painful. The Q angle is defined as the angle between the line from the spina iliaca anterior superior to the center of the patella and the patellar tendon in the frontal plane, as shown in the image below. In flexion, the Q angle normally decreases due to the internal rotation of the tibia with respect to the femur during flexion. Increased valgus load axis, increased femoral anteversion, or lateral position of tibial tuberosity increases the Q angle and with it the forces in lateral direction on the patella. The knee is in extension. The patella is palpated on the proximal side and held in position while the patient is asked to contract the quadriceps. The test is positive when this quadriceps contraction is painful. Physical examination and imaging of the lateral collateral ligament and posterolateral corner of the knee.

Background: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients at risk of developing cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis are identified routinely by the early detection of virus in blood. Objectives: We have evaluated our previously developed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) to a spliced late CMV gene (SLG; J. Virol. Methods 56 (1996), 139) to monitor CMV infection in BMT patients at two clinical sites. Study design: Weekly blood samples from BMT patients were tested for CMV during the first 3 months post-transplant. The RNA and DNA PCR results were analysed in terms of their temporal relationship and consistency of CMV detection and compared with CMV infection diagnosed by viral antigen tests. Results: Of the 101 BMT recipients studied, 25 developed CMV antigenemia and/or DNAemia resulting in symptomatic infection in two patients. The highest incidence of CMV infection was seen in seropositive recipients (R +) irrespective of the donor's status. Detection of CMV infection by SLG RNA preceded CMV DNA detection by 0-2 weeks (median 1 week) and CMV antigen detection by 0-8 weeks (median 3 weeks). Once detected, the SLG RNA remained consistently positive before antiviral treatment was commenced. Both the SLG RNA and CMV DNA detection methods had the same clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of 100, 94, 80 and 100% respectively. Conclusions: The RT-PCR for SLG RNA proved to be the earliest indicator of CMV infection in BMT patients demonstrating a sustained pattern of CMV detection during the 3 months post- transplant period. Although very similar in its diagnostic performance to CMV DNA PCR the SLG RNA RT-PCR does not require quantitation and provides an efficient and ongoing indication of active CMV infection.

D.\n\nIn the mid-1980s in California,Mullis and coworkers developed a method, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), to amplify exponentially target sequences of DNA.11 As the name suggests,the method is a DNA polymerase-mediated chain reaction of nucleic acid amplification. Arguably, it is the single most important \"invention\" that has led to development of a new discipline in clinical laboratory medicine, that is, molecular pathology. However, PCR is orders of magnitude more sensitive and much faster, permitting turnaround time of 24 hours or less. Opportunity for high test volumes, excellent specificity and sensitivity, and the rapid turnaround times of PCR are the principal reasons this technology has spread so quickly in clinical molecular laboratories. the area of interest, but one type of PCR (allele-specific PCR; see below) uses primers that overlap the area of interest. Subsequent to the initial discovery of PCR, the opportunity for automating the cyclical nature of PCR was realized by using DNA polymerase from hot-spring living bacteria, Thermophilus aquaticus (hence the term \"Taq polymerase\"). Thermal cyclers hold small capped tubes containing the reagents needed for PCR and cycle between the temperatures needed for the different steps of the PCR.12 A single PCR tube contains template DNA (<1ng to 1 |ig), Taq DNA polymerase, two PCR primers (~15 to 30 nucleotides long), all four dNTPs, Mg2+, and buffer to maintain an elevated pH (~8.4) optimal for Taq. This doubling plateaus in later cycles since reagents, usually dNTPs, become limiting. While all of the above is true, the practical clinical laboratory difference between one- and four-billion-fold amplification is irrelevant because either number is sufficient for detection of the target, often by elec-trophoresis with EtBr visualization. Several factors affect the specificity and sensitivity of PCR. The production of specific PCR amplicons is a function of both the complementarity of the primers to the target DNA and the annealing temperature of the PCR cycle. In contrast, if the annealing temperature is substantially less than the primer Tm, the primer can bind to both complementary and noncomplementary DNA, resulting in reduced PCR specificity as nontarget DNA is amplified (and potentially decreased sensitivity as reaction components are used nonspecifically). This may be alleviated by using PCR additives such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or glycerol, but the success of these additives may need to be determined empirically for different primer pairs. This prevents the generation of nonspecific amplification products by inhibiting the activity of Taq until after the initial PCR denaturation step. For example, hybridization of a particular 302 bp PCR product band detectable on an agarose gel with a defined cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA probe confirms that the oligonucleotide primers synthesized based on the CMV sequence and used in the PCR are recognizing CMV-specific DNA and that the PCR is indeed specific for detection of CMV. There have been significant commercial endeavors to automate or semiautomate high-volume PCR-based clinical tests. In the presence of amplicon, for example, if the patient is infected with the pathogen of interest or a specific mutation is present, the amplicons hybridize to the bound probe and are retained in the well during washing. Subsequent biochemical reactions are used to detect labeled moieties in the amplicons (\"built in\" to the PCR components), facilitating colorimet-ric detection of a positive patient reaction by an automated plate reader. This scheme has gained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for clinical PCR-based detection kits for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, HCV (qualitative) and HIV.13 (For a complete list of FDA-approved tests, go to the Resources section at http://www.amp.org/, the home page for the Association for Molecular Pathology). Subsequent generations of automated PCR instrumentation are now available that completely automate the amplification and detection process.14 The field is moving toward real-time PCR detection (described below). Cell lysis and subsequent DNA liberation accomplished by boiling or treatment with detergent may be sufficient to process a specimen in preparation for PCR.15 Conventional PCR-based tests may be completed with turnaround times of as short as 2 to 4 hours, while realtime PCR can be completed in 30 minutes, making this technique attractive for stat testing. Just a few of the more common methods ; 2) * The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method of in vitro DNA synthesis uses a DNA template, polymerase, buffers, primers, and nucleotides to multiply the HIV in the blood sample. Then a chemical reaction marks the virus. This is achieved by monitoring the amplification reaction using fluorescence, a technique called real-time PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR). In the study mentioned, the researchers evaluated a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method to monitor cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients.

The babysitter reports that she is 15 years old and has cared for the patient on numerous occasions during the past year. The child's mother, who is a single parent, is currently out of town for business but will return later tonight. The babysitter says, \"He has had a runny nose since I started babysitting yesterday, but this afternoon he awoke from a nap with a barking sound and he was breathing real heavy.\" She does not know the child's prior health history, nor does she know if the boy takes any medications on a regular basis. The child looks tired and sits upright on the babysitter's lap. He is obviously comfortable with his caregiver. Vital signs are temperature 38.7°C (101.7°F), pulse 110/min, respirations 28/min and labored, and blood pressure 85/50 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 89%. Physical examination discloses inspiratory stridor. Neck is supple, tympanic membranes are normal, and there is a profuse nasal discharge. Examination of the pharynx discloses no abnormalities.
