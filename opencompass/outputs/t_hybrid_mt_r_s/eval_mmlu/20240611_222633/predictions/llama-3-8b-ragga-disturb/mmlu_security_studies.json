Lieven argues that securitisation would be especially helpful with climate change as it would enable more military experts to speak out on the subject, with military officers being the one type of expert that conservatives tend to widely respect. On the other hand, the Transnational Institute argues in a Primer on Climate Security that \"framing the climate crisis as a security issue is deeply problematic as it ultimately reinforces a militarised approach to climate change that is likely to deepen the injustices for those most affected by the unfolding crisis. The danger of security solutions is that, by definition, they seek to secure what exists–an unjust status quo.\" A drug policy is the policy regarding the control and regulation of psychoactive substances (commonly referred to as drugs), particularly those that are addictive or cause physical and mental dependence. While drug policies are generally implemented by governments, entities at all levels (from international organisations, national or local government, administrations, or private places) may have specific policies related to drugs. Drug policies are usually aimed at combatting drug addiction or dependence addressing both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as mitigating the harms of drug use, and providing medical assistance and treatment. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Policies that help mitigate the dangers of drug use include needle syringe programs, drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity. For example, heroin is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as khat, codeine, or alcohol are regulated in some places, but not others. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \"drug policy\". International drug control treaties\n\nHistory \nThe first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance was adopted at the Brussels Conference in 1890 in the context of the regulations against slave trade, and concerned alcoholic beverages. It was followed by the final act of the Shanghai Opium Commission of 1909 which attempted to settle peace and arrange the trade in opium, after the opium wars in the 19th Century. In 1912 at the First International Opium Conference held in the Hague, the multilateral International Opium Convention was adopted; it ultimately got incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A number of international treaties related to drugs followed in subsequent decades: the 1925 Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium (which introduced some restrictions—but no total prohibition—on the export of \"Indian hemp\" pure extracts), the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs and Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East, the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, among others. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use. Countries commit to \"protecting the health and welfare of [hu]mankind\" and to combat substance abuse and addiction. The treaty is not a self-enforcing agreement: countries have to pass their own legislation aligned with the framework of the Convention. Contrary to common beliefs, these treaties have not particularly been influenced by the United States in their drafting, but rather by countries like France, the United Kingdom, South Africa or Egypt. Their implementation, however, has been led by the USA, in particular after the Nixon administration's declaration of \"War on drugs\" in 1971 and the creation of the DEA in 1973. Current treaties \nThe core drug control treaties currently in force internationally are:\n\n the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (1961 Convention or Single Convention) composed of:\n the original Single Convention concluded at New York (United States), 30 March 1961, and\n its amendement, the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs which was adopted in Geneva (Switzerland), 25 March 1972,\n the Convention on psychotropic substances (1971 Convention), concluded at Vienna, 21 February 1971, and\n the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988 Convention) concluded at Vienna (Austria), 20 December 1988. There are other treaties that address drugs under international control, such as:\n\n the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), concluded on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica),\n the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), concluded on 20 November 1989 in New York City,\n the International Convention Against Doping in Sport concluded in Paris (France) on 19 October 2005. Additionally, other pieces of international law enter into play, like the international human rights treaties protecting the right to health or the rights of indigenous peoples, and, in the case of plants considered as drug crops (coca plant, cannabis, opium poppy), treaties protecting the right to land, farmers' of peasants' rights, and treaties on plant genetic resources or traditional knowledge. Treaty-mandated organizations \nThere are four bodies mandated under the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988):\n\n The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a subsidiary body of the United Nations ECOSOC, the CND is acting as a conference of the Parties to the three core Conventions,\n the UN Secretary-General, whose mandate is de facto carried on by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),\n the World Health Organization (WHO), in charge of the scientific review of substances for inclusion under, changes in, or withdrawal from control (scheduling assessment),\n the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the treaty-body monitoring implementation and collecting statistical data. Drug policy by country\n\nAustralia \n\nAustralian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. Bolivia \nLike Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. Canada\n\nColombia \n\nUnder President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \"smuggler pardon\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. Germany \n\nCompared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\"BtmG\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India\n\nIndonesia \nLike many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Netherlands \n\nDrug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. Sweden \n\nSweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement. The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time. Switzerland\nThe national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem. Ukraine\nCrimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327. According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\". On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy\nThe director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \"War on Drugs\":\n\nThe U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control. It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.

Law enforcement is in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of robust non-key recovery encryption ultimately will devastate our ability to fight crime and prevent terrorism. Uncrackable encryption will allow drug lords, spies, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their crimes and their conspiracies with impunity. We will lose one of the few remaining vulnerabilities of the worst criminals and terrorists upon which law enforcement depends to successfully investigate and often prevent the worst crimes. For this reason, the law enforcement community is unanimous in calling for a balanced solution to this problem.\" A drug policy is the policy regarding the control and regulation of psychoactive substances (commonly referred to as drugs), particularly those that are addictive or cause physical and mental dependence.

Treaty-mandated organizations \nThere are four bodies mandated under the international drug control conventions (1961, 1971 and 1988):\n\n The Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND), a subsidiary body of the United Nations ECOSOC, the CND is acting as a conference of the Parties to the three core Conventions,\n the UN Secretary-General, whose mandate is de facto carried on by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC),\n the World Health Organization (WHO), in charge of the scientific review of substances for inclusion under, changes in, or withdrawal from control (scheduling assessment),\n the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), the treaty-body monitoring implementation and collecting statistical data. Drug policy by country\n\nAustralia \n\nAustralian drug laws are criminal laws and mostly exist at the state and territory level, not the federal, and are therefore different, which means an analysis of trends and laws for Australia is complicated. Bolivia \nLike Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. Canada\n\nColombia \n\nUnder President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \"smuggler pardon\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. Germany \n\nCompared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\"BtmG\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India\n\nIndonesia \nLike many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Netherlands \n\nDrug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. Sweden \n\nSweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement. The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time. Switzerland\nThe national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem. Ukraine\nCrimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327. According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\". On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy\nThe director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \"War on Drugs\":\n\nThe U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control. It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.

Nevertheless, it is a top priority in security discourses. \"If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem. Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. According to an overview of the field by Roe, securitization theorists tend to treat securitization as a negative process that undermines democratic processes and diminishes necessary scrutiny that would otherwise be focused on political elites.\n\nThere is a multiple-choice question about security studies.

State responses to transnational crime have evolved in correlation to the increased threat posed to the integrity of the state. Organized crime has been regarded primarily as a national security threat to be addressed domestically. The institutionalized international approaches for information sharing have been predominately bilateral to the extent of bringing to justice perpetrators of crime that are seeking to evade justice.\nB. With the expansion of TNC in the 1990s, states became increasingly willing to take measures to reduce the asymmetries between countries through harmonization of legislation and increasing police capacity and networking. The government response to transnational crime has focused on targeting the individuals and organizations perpetrating the crime, rather than the criminal markets themselves.\nC. The US war on drugs has heavily influenced the construction of the governmental response to the growing perception that the phenomenon of TNC represents a national security threat. The approach has an emphasis on bilateral and multilateral cooperation on law enforcement combined with sticks on a bi-lateral basis to induce states to increase regulation and enforcement against TNC.\nD. The emergence of norms governing the response to address the spectre of organized crime and to harmonize legislation occurred with the evolving Global War on Terror in which the terrorism-organized crime nexus resulted in the militarization of law enforcement: the use of military technology and intelligence as opposed to addressing the underlying conditions that facilitate illicit trade through an international institutionalist response.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Lieven argues that securitisation would be especially helpful with climate change as it would enable more military experts to speak out on the subject, with military officers being the one type of expert that conservatives tend to widely respect. On the other hand, the Transnational Institute argues in a Primer on Climate Security that \"framing the climate crisis as a security issue is deeply problematic as it ultimately reinforces a militarised approach to climate change that is likely to deepen the injustices for those most affected by the unfolding crisis. The danger of security solutions is that, by definition, they seek to secure what exists–an unjust status quo.\" A drug policy is the policy regarding the control and regulation of psychoactive substances (commonly referred to as drugs), particularly those that are addictive or cause physical and mental dependence. While drug policies are generally implemented by governments, entities at all levels (from international organisations, national or local government, administrations, or private places) may have specific policies related to drugs. Drug policies are usually aimed at combatting drug addiction or dependence addressing both the demand and supply of drugs, as well as mitigating the harms of drug use, and providing medical assistance and treatment. Supply side reduction involves measures such as enacting foreign policy aimed at eradicating the international cultivation of plants used to make drugs and interception of drug trafficking, fines for drug offenses, incarceration for persons convicted for drug offenses. Policies that help mitigate the dangers of drug use include needle syringe programs, drug substitution programs, and free facilities for testing a drug's purity. For example, heroin is regulated almost everywhere; substances such as khat, codeine, or alcohol are regulated in some places, but not others. Most jurisdictions also regulate prescription drugs, medicinal drugs not considered dangerous but that can only be supplied to holders of a medical prescription, and sometimes drugs available without prescription but only from an approved supplier such as a pharmacy, but this is not usually described as a \"drug policy\". International drug control treaties\n\nHistory \nThe first international treaty to control a psychoactive substance was adopted at the Brussels Conference in 1890 in the context of the regulations against slave trade, and concerned alcoholic beverages. It was followed by the final act of the Shanghai Opium Commission of 1909 which attempted to settle peace and arrange the trade in opium, after the opium wars in the 19th Century. In 1912 at the First International Opium Conference held in the Hague, the multilateral International Opium Convention was adopted; it ultimately got incorporated into the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. A number of international treaties related to drugs followed in subsequent decades: the 1925 Agreement concerning the Manufacture of, Internal Trade in and Use of Prepared Opium (which introduced some restrictions—but no total prohibition—on the export of \"Indian hemp\" pure extracts), the 1931 Convention for Limiting the Manufacture and Regulating the Distribution of Narcotic Drugs and Agreement for the Control of Opium Smoking in the Far East, the 1936 Convention for the Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs, among others. Finally, in 1961 the nine previous drug-control treaties in force were superseded by the 1961 Single Convention, which rationalized global control on drug trading and use. Countries commit to \"protecting the health and welfare of [hu]mankind\" and to combat substance abuse and addiction. The treaty is not a self-enforcing agreement: countries have to pass their own legislation aligned with the framework of the Convention. Contrary to common beliefs, these treaties have not particularly been influenced by the United States in their drafting, but rather by countries like France, the United Kingdom, South Africa or Egypt. Their implementation, however, has been led by the USA, in particular after the Nixon administration's declaration of \"War on drugs\" in 1971 and the creation of the DEA in 1973. Current treaties \nThe core drug control treaties currently in force internationally are:\n\n the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 (1961 Convention or Single Convention) composed of:\n the original Single Convention concluded at New York (United States), 30 March 1961, and\n its amendement, the Protocol amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs which was adopted in Geneva (Switzerland), 25 March 1972,\n the Convention on psychotropic substances (1971 Convention), concluded at Vienna, 21 February 1971, and\n the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988 Convention) concluded at Vienna (Austria), 20 December 1988. There are other treaties that address drugs under international control, such as:\n\n the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), concluded on 10 December 1982 in Montego Bay (Jamaica),\n the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), concluded on 20 November 1989 in New York City,\n the International Convention Against Doping in Sport concluded in Paris (France) on 19 October 2005.

Law enforcement is in unanimous agreement that the widespread use of robust non-key recovery encryption ultimately will devastate our ability to fight crime and prevent terrorism. Uncrackable encryption will allow drug lords, spies, terrorists and even violent gangs to communicate about their crimes and their conspiracies with impunity. We will lose one of the few remaining vulnerabilities of the worst criminals and terrorists upon which law enforcement depends to successfully investigate and often prevent the worst crimes. For this reason, the law enforcement community is unanimous in calling for a balanced solution to this problem.\" A drug policy is the policy regarding the control and regulation of psychoactive substances (commonly referred to as drugs), particularly those that are addictive or cause physical and mental dependence.

Bolivia \nLike Colombia, the Bolivian government signed onto the ATPA in 1991 and called for the forced eradication of the coca plant in the 1990s and early 2000s. President Morales opposed the decriminalization of drugs but saw the coca crop as an important piece of indigenous history and a pillar of the community because of the traditional use of chewing coca leaves. Canada\n\nColombia \n\nUnder President Ronald Reagan, the United States declared War on Drugs in the late 1980s; the Colombian drug lords were widely viewed as the root of the cocaine issue in America. This prohibitionist regime has had controversial results, especially on human rights. In 2014, Colombia further eased its prohibitionist stance on the coca crop by ceasing aerial fumigation of the coca crop and creating programs for addicts. Three of the four countries in the Andean Region were invited to the Summit: Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, with the notable absence of Ecuador. Two of those three countries—Colombia and Bolivia—joined the Andean Trade Preference Act, later called the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, in 1992. In 1991, President Rodrigo Borja Cevallos passed Law 108, a law that decriminalized drug use, while continuing to prosecute drug possession. This led to a large increase in prison populations, as 100% of drug crimes were processed. In 2008, under Ecuador's new Constitution, current prisoners serving time were allowed the \"smuggler pardon\" if they were prosecuted for purchasing or carrying up to 2 kg of any drug, and they already served 10% of their sentence. The COIP contains many of the same rules and regulations as Law 108,  but it established clear distinctions among large, medium and small drug traffickers, as well as between the mafia and rural growers, and prosecutes accordingly. Germany \n\nCompared with other EU countries, Germany's drug policy is considered progressive, but still stricter than, for example, the Netherlands. In 2000, Germany changed the narcotic law (\"BtmG\") to allow supervised drug injection rooms. In 2002, they started a pilot study in seven German cities to evaluate the effects of heroin-assisted treatment on addicts, compared to methadone-assisted treatment. The positive results of the study led to the inclusion of heroin-assisted treatment into the services of the mandatory health insurance in 2009. India\n\nIndonesia \nLike many other governments in Southeast Asia, the Indonesian government applies severe laws to discourage drug use. Netherlands \n\nDrug policy in the Netherlands is based on two principles: that drug use is a health issue, not a criminal issue, and that there is a distinction between hard and soft drugs. It was also one of the first countries to introduce heroin-assisted treatment and safe injection sites. Importing and exporting of any classified drug is a serious offence. The penalty can run up to 12 to 16 years if it is for hard drugs, or a maximum of 4 years for importing or exporting large quantities of cannabis. The Netherlands spends significantly more per capita than all other countries in the EU on drug law enforcement. The offense was however changed from a criminal one, with prison a possible punishment, to an administrative one if the possessing was no more than up to ten days' supply of that substance. Drug addicts were then aggressively targeted with therapy or community service rather than fines or waivers. The Soviet Union inherited a population with widespread drug addiction, and in the 1920s, tried to tackle it by introducing a 10-year prison sentence for drug-dealers. Sweden \n\nSweden's drug policy has gradually turned from lenient in the 1960s with an emphasis on drug supply towards a policy of zero tolerance against all illicit drug use (including cannabis). The condition for suspended sentences could be regular drug tests or submission to rehabilitation treatment. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that Sweden has one of the lowest drug use rates in the Western world, and attributes this to a drug policy that invests heavily in prevention and treatment as well as strict law enforcement. The general drug policy is supported by all political parties and, according to opinion polls made in the mid 2000s, the restrictive approach received broad support from the public at that time. Switzerland\nThe national drug policy of Switzerland was developed in the early 1990s and comprises the four elements of prevention, therapy, harm reduction and prohibition. In 1994 Switzerland was one of the first countries to try heroin-assisted treatment and other harm reduction measures like supervised injection rooms. In 2008 a popular initiative by the right wing Swiss People's Party aimed at ending the heroin program was rejected by more than two thirds of the voters. Control of narcotic substances is carried out in accordance with the Law on Combating Drugs of 1979. It is worth noting that most people arrested for possessing a small amount of substances from the V-th category are fined and not imprisoned. At present, in Thailand, the anti-drug police are considering methamphetamines as a more serious and dangerous problem. Ukraine\nCrimes in the sphere of trafficking in narcotic, psychotropic substances and crimes against health are classified using the 13th section of the Criminal Code of Ukraine; articles from 305 to 327. According to official statistics for 2016, 53% of crimes in the field of drugs fall on art. 309 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine: \"illegal production, manufacture, acquisition, storage, transportation or shipment of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or their analogues without the purpose of sale\". On August 28, 2013, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine adopted a strategy for state policy on drugs until 2020. The strategy developed by the State Drug Control Service, involves strengthening criminal liability for distributing large amounts of drugs, and easing the penalty for possession of small doses. In October 2018, the State Service of Ukraine on Drugs and Drug Control issued the first license for the import and re-export of raw materials and products derived from cannabis. Punishment for marijuana possession is light in most states, but punishment for dealing and possession of hard drugs can be severe, and has contributed to the growth of the prison population. US drug policy is also heavily invested in foreign policy, supporting military and paramilitary actions in South America, Central Asia, and other places to eradicate the growth of coca and opium. The project is often criticized for its ineffectiveness and its negative impact on local farmers, but it has been effective in destroying the once-powerful drug cartels and guerrilla groups of Colombia. May 21, 2012 the U.S Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy\nThe director of ONDCP stated simultaneously that this policy is something different than \"War on Drugs\":\n\nThe U.S Government see the policy as a “third way” approach to drug control one that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world’s preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse. The policy does not see drug legalization as the “silver bullet” solution to drug control. It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.

Nevertheless, it is a top priority in security discourses. \"If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem. Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. According to an overview of the field by Roe, securitization theorists tend to treat securitization as a negative process that undermines democratic processes and diminishes necessary scrutiny that would otherwise be focused on political elites.\n\n"

Cozza, M.D. He was instrumental in organizing and executing the initial mental health response to the September 11th 2001 attack on the Pentagon. Under his leadership, the Walter Reed Department of Psychiatry spearheaded the initiative to provide mental health services, support and follow up to the many injured service members, their families and their children who receive medical treatment. As the Associate Director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, Child and Family Programs, Dr. Cozza has highlighted the impact of deployment, injury, illness and death on the children and families of military service members. He is principal investigator on several congressionally funded grants examining the characteristics of child neglect in military communities, the impact of parental combat injury on children and families, the effectiveness of a family based intervention with combat injured families (FOCUS-CI), as well as the impact of military family bereavement. Dr. Cozza serves as a scientific advisor to several national organizations that focus on military children and families, as well as the broader experiences of traumatized or bereaved children. Mary Fetchet is the driving force behind Voices of September 11th (VOICES), an organization she co-founded in 2001 following the death of her 24 year old son Brad at the World Trade Center. As a family member, she was instrumental in campaigning for the creation of the 9/11 Commission and the implementation of reforms based on their recommendations. An expert on the long-term needs of victims and survivors, mental health care, preparedness, and national security reforms, she has made hundreds of appearances on national television and at conferences in the U.S. and abroad, and contributes regularly to print and radio.

Susheel Gupta is currently the Vice-Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. With respect to National Security and Intelligence issues, Susheel was one of the co-counsels in Canada's first prosecution under the Anti-Terrorism Act. On a more personal note, Susheel has been actively involved in issues concerning national security, terrorism and aviation security. Susheel is the co-Chair of the Kanishka Project Steering Committee which has been overseeing a $10 million dollar grants budget towards research that will assist first responders, victims of crime and terrorism and strengthen Canada's counter-terrorism and national security agenda. Susheel brings a unique and diverse background on issues that are relevant to all of us and offers many perspectives due to his security and justice system expertise and experience as a Canadian victim of terrorism. He provides acute crisis intervention following acts of violence and atrocity, trains crisis teams and schools in responding to mass trauma events, and has consulted with organizations on the implementation of trauma-informed care. He was particularly active in the treatment of children, families, and service professionals in the New York area following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As MOVA's Executive Director Liam increased access to training for victim service providers and secured $8.3M in funding for services for survivors of the Boston Marathon Bombing. Under Liam's leadership, MOVA administers federal Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) funding to support free services for victims of crime and regularly informs public policy impacting crime victims.

Dr. Shear is the first clinical researcher to develop an efficacious treatment for complicated grief and her work in this area led to collaboration with New York State Office of Mental Health and FEMA in the response to the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. She ran numerous trainings for Project Liberty counselors and developed a video to facilitate recognition of complicated grief as well as a Guidebook for a 10-session intervention that was adapted for the enhanced services initiative. This treatment is strength-based and incorporates methods from other proven efficacious of psychotherapy to provide a short-term, focused approach to fostering adaptation to loss. For her innovation and leadership on behalf of victims she received the Edmund J. Randolph Award, the highest honor provided by the Department of Justice, in 2000.

        "context": " Securitization in international relations and national politics is the process of state actors transforming subjects from regular political issues into matters of \"security\": thus enabling extraordinary means to be used in the name of security. Issues that become securitized do not necessarily represent issues that are essential to the objective survival of a state, but rather represent issues where someone was successful in constructing an issue into an existential problem. Securitization theorists assert that successfully securitized subjects receive disproportionate amounts of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects causing more human damage. A common example used by theorists is how terrorism is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism. Securitization studies aims to understand \"who securitizes (securitizing actor), on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions.\" The effectiveness of the World Trade Center towers as a symbol is apparent in the discussion that continues about them today. Many argue they were chosen because the towers represent Western power, wealth, commerce, and materialism. The towers dominated the New York City skyline, making their loss, and the symbolic destruction of American commerce and power, all the more visible. Similarly, the Pentagon was a strategic target because of its symbolism as the branch of the American government which protects the country. The terrorists behind 9/11 sought to undermine these greater themes of American life \n\nStephen J. Cozza, M.D. He was instrumental in organizing and executing the initial mental health response to the September 11th 2001 attack on the Pentagon. Under his leadership, the Walter Reed Department of Psychiatry spearheaded the initiative to provide mental health services, support and follow up to the many injured service members, their families and their children who receive medical treatment. As the Associate Director of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress, Child and Family Programs, Dr. Cozza has highlighted the impact of deployment, injury, illness and death on the children and families of military service members. He is principal investigator on several congressionally funded grants examining the characteristics of child neglect in military communities, the impact of parental combat injury on children and families, the effectiveness of a family based intervention with combat injured families (FOCUS-CI), as well as the impact of military family bereavement. Dr. Cozza serves as a scientific advisor to several national organizations that focus on military children and families, as well as the broader experiences of traumatized or bereaved children. Mary Fetchet is the driving force behind Voices of September 11th (VOICES), an organization she co-founded in 2001 following the death of her 24 year old son Brad at the World Trade Center. As a family member, she was instrumental in campaigning for the creation of the 9/11 Commission and the implementation of reforms based on their recommendations. An expert on the long-term needs of victims and survivors, mental health care, preparedness, and national security reforms, she has made hundreds of appearances on national television and at conferences in the U.S. and abroad, and contributes regularly to print and radio. Dr. Stephen Flynn is Professor of Political Science with faculty affiliations in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts. He is also Director, Center for Resilience Studies Co-Director of the George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security. He holds research affiliations with the Wharton School's Risk Management and Decision Processes Center, Columbia University's National Disaster Preparedness Center, and the Homeland Security Studies and Analysis Institute. In September 2014 he was appointed by Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson to serve a member of the Homeland Security Science and Technology Advisory Council (HSSTAC). and Ph.D. degrees from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University and B.S. Susheel Gupta is currently the Vice-Chairperson of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. With respect to National Security and Intelligence issues, Susheel was one of the co-counsels in Canada's first prosecution under the Anti-Terrorism Act. On a more personal note, Susheel has been actively involved in issues concerning national security, terrorism and aviation security. Susheel is the co-Chair of the Kanishka Project Steering Committee which has been overseeing a $10 million dollar grants budget towards research that will assist first responders, victims of crime and terrorism and strengthen Canada's counter-terrorism and national security agenda. Susheel brings a unique and diverse background on issues that are relevant to all of us and offers many perspectives due to his security and justice system expertise and experience as a Canadian victim of terrorism. He provides acute crisis intervention following acts of violence and atrocity, trains crisis teams and schools in responding to mass trauma events, and has consulted with organizations on the implementation of trauma-informed care. He was particularly active in the treatment of children, families, and service professionals in the New York area following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As MOVA's Executive Director Liam increased access to training for victim service providers and secured $8.3M in funding for services for survivors of the Boston Marathon Bombing. Under Liam's leadership, MOVA administers federal Victim of Crime Act (VOCA) funding to support free services for victims of crime and regularly informs public policy impacting crime victims. He has responded to various crises and disasters including aviation crashes, bank robberies, fires, floods, hurricanes and motor vehicle crashes. The Assembly of the APA commended NJPA for \"exemplary service rendered in response to the attack on America September 11, 2001.\" He authored a chapter for Conquering Chronic Pain After Injury: An Integrative Approach to Treating Post-Traumatic Pain and for Disaster Psychiatry: Intervening When Nightmares Come True. He has given over 110 lectures on the topics of posttraumatic stress, disaster and threat behavior, resiliency, and disaster mental health; designed and taught many courses, and organized and directed conferences including \"Disasters and Traumatic Stress, To Debrief or Not To Debrief: A CME Symposium on Early Interventions,\" a full day educational activity for disaster mental health professionals in the NJ-NY region on May 19, 2001. Dr Napoli has been quoted in print media includingMen's Health, Real Simple, Self, and various newspapers, and interviewed on CBS-TV, CNBC, WOR-TV, WPVI-TV, by numerous radios stations, and MSNBC including a live studio interview by Contessa Brewer, Anchor/Host, Caught on Camera during the rescue of the 33 Chilean miners on the mental health aspects of their being trapped. He has done post-graduate training in trauma psychiatry, emergency management, disaster mental health, group therapy and psychoanalysis. He is recognized as one ofAmerica's Top Physicians and America's Top Psychiatrists, as a Top Doctor, New York Metro Area by Castle-Connelly, and as a New Jersey Top Doctor by Inside Jersey Magazine. Continuing forward with her work, and drawing on her background and interest in assisting those affected by crime, Ms. O'Sullivan began an appointed term as Canada's Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime on August 16, 2010. Ms. O'Sullivan's passion for change and dedication to those she serves has been recognized on numerous occasions, including as recipient of the Queen's Golden and Diamond Jubilee Medals, the Police Exemplary Service Medal, la mèdaille \"Vigilance et Loyautè - èchelon Chene d'argent - Suretè du Quebec\", the 110th Anniversary of Scouts Canada Commemorative Centennial Medal and the YMCA-YWCA Women of Distinction Award. Sue has a Bachelor of Arts in Law and Sociology with a subtitle in Criminology and Corrections (Carleton University) and is a graduate of the Police Leadership Program (OACP and the University of Toronto) and the Leadership in Counter Terrorism Program. Dr. Shear is the first clinical researcher to develop an efficacious treatment for complicated grief and her work in this area led to collaboration with New York State Office of Mental Health and FEMA in the response to the 9-11 World Trade Center attacks. She ran numerous trainings for Project Liberty counselors and developed a video to facilitate recognition of complicated grief as well as a Guidebook for a 10-session intervention that was adapted for the enhanced services initiative. This treatment is strength-based and incorporates methods from other proven efficacious of psychotherapy to provide a short-term, focused approach to fostering adaptation to loss. For her innovation and leadership on behalf of victims she received the Edmund J. Randolph Award, the highest honor provided by the Department of Justice, in 2000. In 2001, she received the Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service and the National Intelligence Meritorious Unit Citation from the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for her work on the Pan Am 103/Lockerbie prosecution.

The modern environmental movement has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe ecological footprint overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the climate change problem. That system trait is systemic change resistance.

Analysis of environmental security is understood as the integrity of the whole ecological system whose primary threat is human activity. However, it radically challenges security thinking in that it demands a shift in the reason for action from national security interest to the welfare of the entire social-ecological system of the planet.\nB. Environmental security contends that the principle threat to the ecological integrity is human activity and therefore humans can be secured to the extent that welfare is protected at the domestic level. The reason for action is to be found in individual and national interests.\nC. The crossover of common insecurity issue areas is unlikely because not all problems are truly global. Not all states are equally responsible for environmental problems, nor is there such a thing as equality of risk. Systemic interdependence is unlikely to manage those security areas.\nD. The ecological security and human security approaches to environmental security do not challenge the security community to consider alternative objects of security.

Weak state insecurity in a historical framework of analysis represents an abnormal state in the long term state-building process. Bloody and violent conflict between social forces is not consistent with the presence of the centralizing force with the capacity to attain monopoly of control over violence.\nB. The utility of explaining weak state insecurity with a comparison to the historical conditions of state consolidation in Europe does not stand in the contemporary context of global society because of the pervasion of international norms to prevent violent conflict from manifesting in the consolidation process.\nC. The contemporary state-building condition is constrained by the shortened time-frame operating within the established guidelines of international norms, a particular problematic rule of which is sovereignty. Thus, unlike some European entities which could not complete the state-building process and were absorbed into more viable units, weak states will remain quasi entities.\nD. Weak state insecurity originated from the denial of sovereignty as the norm and the corresponding extension of the right to inviolability of statehood. Without protection under international laws the possibility of its national status being revoked and its territory being subsumed into another state threatens the consolidation of the state-building process.\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
