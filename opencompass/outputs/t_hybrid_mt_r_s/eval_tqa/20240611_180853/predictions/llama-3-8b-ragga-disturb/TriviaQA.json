After the match, Hogan apparently signed a few autographs and commented that the course was “so good, it makes you think you’re not in Texas.”\n\n Steve Kraly was asked to give information for Kenneth Hogan's book, Batting 10th for the Yankees: Recollection of 30 Yankees You May Not Remember.

As part of Virgin's strategy to make the group an international act, \"Wannabe\" was released in Japan and Southeast Asia two weeks before its British release. After the song was placed into heavy rotation on FM stations in Japan, the Spice Girls made promotional tours in May, July, and September 1996. The group received major press and TV exposure, appearing in programmes such as Space Shower. The press conference was held at St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, the location where the Spice Girls filmed the music video for their breakthrough \n\n In May 1997, the Spice Girls went on a promotional visit to the Cannes Film Festival in the south of France, where they announced their then-upcoming movie Spice World (1997).

Slater (born 1955), filmmaker and composer ; John Slater (actor) (1916–1975), English actor ; John Slater (musician), British heavy metal guitarist with Rise to Addiction \n\n have all been named after directors whom Sutherland has worked with: Kiefer is named after American-born director and writer Warren Kiefer, who, under the assumed name of Lorenzo Sabatini, directed Sutherland in his first feature film, the Italian low-budget horror film Il castello dei morti vivi (Castle of the Living Dead); Roeg is named after director Nicolas Roeg; Rossif is named after French director Frédéric Rossif; and Angus Redford has his middle name after Robert Redford. Sutherland rose to fame after starring in films including The Dirty Dozen (1967), M*A*S*H (1970), Kelly's Heroes (1970), Klute (1971), Don't Look Now (1973), Fellini's Casanova (1976), 1900 (1976), The Eagle Has Landed (1976), Animal House (1978), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), Ordinary People (1980), and Eye of the Needle (1981). He is the father of actors Kiefer Sutherland, Rossif Sutherland, and Angus Sutherland. She was born Kristine Young in Boise, Idaho, and changed her name because she was often confused with another similarly named actress. The last name \"Sutherland\" was after her cat, whom she named \"Donald\" after Donald Sutherland, who, coincidentally, had a role in the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer film, Joss Whedon's first attempt to bring Buffy to audiences. She is not related to Donald Sutherland, his sons Kiefer, Rossif and Angus, or his granddaughter Sarah Sutherland. Sutherland was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Dorothy Isobel (née McNichol; 1892–1956) and Frederick McLea Sutherland (1894–1983), who worked in sales and ran the local gas, electricity and bus company. Sutherland graduated from Bridgewater High School. He then studied at Victoria University, an affiliated college of the University of Toronto, where he met his first wife Lois May Hardwick (not to be confused with the child star of the same name Lois Ann Hardwick), and graduated with a double major in engineering and drama.\n\n"

Olga Kurylenko, who starred in the eventual 2018 film, stated about Lost in La Mancha, \"You watch and you think, poor Terry. different directors, Albert Marre, Peter Glenville, and Arthur Hiller were hired at separate times to make the film, with Marre and Glenville both being fired early in the project, and Hiller, who ended up also producing, responsible for the final result. Man of La Mancha was Damiani's only film made for theatrical release. A production of Verdi's Macbeth with Damiani's set designs is available on DVD, as is the film version of Man of La Mancha, and the 1968 Cavalleria Rusticana. The theater producer said that it took three years to cast the leading role because in Hwang he had found the right actor to rival Antonio Banderas' Broadway performance. He has since starred in University of Laughs, The Wedding Singer and Man of La Mancha. For his role as a blind swordsman \n\n Damiani designed the sets and costumes for the 1972 film, Man of La Mancha, based on the hit Broadway musical. Star Peter O'Toole, who portrayed both Miguel de Cervantes and his literary creation Don Quixote in the film, was only one of several who reportedly criticized Damiani's sets as being \"too depressing\"; however, the creators of the original stage production intended the physical look of it to be rather plain, as they specified in articles written for the original souvenir program of the show, so the drabness of the film's sets may have been quite intentional. Those who criticized them may have been expecting the standard \"pretty\" set designs usually found in movie\n\n"

This no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Note also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. Differing direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. For their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia. 2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\". However—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context. Others have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident. Liquidator mortality \n\nThe uncertain and contested mortality rate of the Chernobyl liquidators is a major factor in the lack of consensus on the Chernobyl disaster's accurate death toll. Following the disaster itself, the Soviet Union organized an effort to stabilize and seal off the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of an estimated 600,000 \"liquidators\" recruited or conscripted from all over the Soviet Union. The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low. For their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health. Addressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated based upon his team's research. Greenpeace have projected up to a million excess, cancer-related deaths from the Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl Forum, the WHO, and other international agencies do not accept this number. Methodological debates \nThe use of differing, contested methods to identify and tally deaths—including anticipated deaths due to long-latency diseases—has also contributed to the wide range of estimates of the Chernobyl disaster's death toll. Indeed, at the August 1986 meeting of the first international conference on the disaster, the IAEA scaled down from 40,000 to 4,000 the projected disaster-related deaths estimate of Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official commission—after objecting to Legasov's use of a statistical model based on radiation data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Similarly, some theoretical estimates of the disaster's deaths are disputed on the grounds that they rely upon contested models such as the linear no-threshold model (LNT) or hormesis in order to compare the disaster's estimated cancer rates to background rates of cancer. Yet even estimated death tolls that have acknowledged and attempted to mitigate for such methodological debates have yielded a body of divergent estimates—including the Union of Concerned Scientists' 2011, LNT-model-based conclusion of 27,000 deaths due to the accident; the death toll of 93,000 to 200,000 that Greenpeace has posited since 2006; and Chernobyl: Consequences of the Catastrophe for People and the Environment (published in 2007 by Russian affiliates of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, but without NYAS' explicit approval), which estimates 985,000 premature deaths as a result of the radioactivity the accident released. For example, authorities have long dismissed as 'urban legend' some Pripyat evacuees' claims of high death rates among fellow citizens who gathered on a railway bridge—the so-called 'Bridge of Death'—to watch the exploded reactor's blazing fire and glowing, electric blue column of ionized air in the midst of visible nuclear fallout on the night of the accident. Indeed, some authorities have argued that post-disaster psychological trauma—sometimes characterized as Radiophobia or labeled a mental aspect of the collection of post-accident symptoms that some physicians term 'Chernobyl Syndrome'—has led some former residents of the region surrounding the plant to attribute deaths to the accident based on anecdotal evidence alone. In this vein, the Chernobyl Forum, the World Nuclear Association (WNA), and other groups posit an increase in psychological problems among those exposed to the disaster's radiation, due in part to poor communication of radiation's effects, disruption to their way of life, and trauma surrounding the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In response, some former residents of the region that now comprises the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and Polesie State Radioecological Reserve—including Lyubov Sirota, a Ukrainian poet and Pripyat evacuee, in her 1995, Chernobyl Poems verse, \"Radiophobia\", and her 2013 memoir, The Pripyat Syndrome—decry such questioning of survivors' psychology and discernment as efforts to dismiss and de-legitimize both evacuees' claimed long-term experience of the disaster's lethal impacts and evacuees' allegations of the accident's tangible, ongoing effects upon their physical health.

        "context": "The Chernobyl disaster, considered the worst nuclear disaster in history, occurred on 26 April 1986 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, then part of the Soviet Union, now in Ukraine. This no-threshold epidemiology problem is not unique to Chernobyl, and similarly hinders attempts to estimate low level radon pollution, air pollution and natural sunlight exposures. Note also that a paper in Science states there is no transgenerational effect of radiation in children born of those working as liquidators. Differing direct, short-term death toll counts \nInitially, the Soviet Union's toll of deaths directly caused by the Chernobyl disaster included only the two Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant workers killed in the immediate aftermath of the explosion of the plant's reactor. For their part, some surviving evacuees of regions now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve argue that the official toll of the accident's direct casualties excludes trauma and ARS deaths that they themselves claim to have witnessed in the weeks and months after the reactor explosion. In response, constituent agencies of the United Nations—including the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Chernobyl Forum—discount such evacuee claims as misinformation, \"urban legends\", or radiophobia. 2005 and 2006 UN reports debate \nIn August 1986—at the first international conference on the Chernobyl disaster—the IAEA established but did not make official a figure of 4,000 deaths as the total number of projected deaths caused by the accident over the long term. In 2005 and 2006, a joint group of the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia—acknowledging the ongoing scientific, medical, social scientific, and public questioning of the accident's death toll that had emerged over the then-20 years since the disaster—worked to establish international consensus on the effects of the accident via a series of reports that collated 20 years of research to make official previous UN, IAEA, and World Health Organization (WHO) estimates of a total 4,000 deaths due to disaster-related illnesses in \"the higher-exposed Chernobyl populations\". However—as an April 2006 special report in the peer-reviewed, scientific journal Nature detailed in response—the accuracy and precision of this United Nations-led joint group's projected death toll of 4,000 were immediately contested, with several of the very scientists, physicians, and biomedical consortia whose work the joint group had cited alleging publicly that the joint group had either misrepresented their work or interpreted it out of context. Others have also found fault with the United Nations-led joint group's findings in the years since their initial publication, arguing that the 4,000 figure is too low—including the Union of Concerned Scientists; surviving Chernobyl liquidators; evacuees of Chernobyl, Pripyat, and other areas now included in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and the Polesie State Radioecological Reserve; environmental groups like Greenpeace; and several of the Ukrainian and Belarussian scientists and physicians who have studied and treated relocated evacuees and liquidators over the decades since the accident. Liquidator mortality \n\nThe uncertain and contested mortality rate of the Chernobyl liquidators is a major factor in the lack of consensus on the Chernobyl disaster's accurate death toll. Following the disaster itself, the Soviet Union organized an effort to stabilize and seal off the reactor area, still awash in radiation, using the efforts of an estimated 600,000 \"liquidators\" recruited or conscripted from all over the Soviet Union. The National Commission for Radiation Protection of Ukraine disputed the 6,000 estimate as much too high, maintaining that a Chernobyl-cleanup-related death toll of 6,000 would outstrip confirmed liquidator deaths from all other causes—including old age and car crashes—during the period in question. In contrast, representatives of Kiev's National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine, the Union of Chernobyl Liquidators, and the WHO's Radiation Protection Programme argue that both the perilous conditions in which the liquidators worked and the secrecy with which the Soviet Union shrouded the highly classified disaster cleanup efforts not only preclude dismissing a liquidator death toll of 6,000, but also indicate that the 6,000 estimate might be too low. For their part, some surviving Chernobyl liquidators have argued publicly since the declassification of additional records in the early 2000s that official records and bureaucratic assessments do not reflect the full scope of liquidators' claims of disaster-related deaths. Examples of such claims include the comments of surviving liquidators in the Prix Italia-winning 2006 documentary, The Battle of Chernobyl, as well as Valeriy Starodumov's comments in the 2011 Ukrainian documentary Chornobyl.3828, which chronicles Starodumov's, and other liquidators' work and posits its long-term effects on their lives and health. Addressing long-latency diseases in a widely cited 2008 report, the IAEA reaffirmed its August 1986 conclusion—initially reached at the first international conference on the accident (an event closed to the press and citizen observers) and made official in 2005 and 2006—of a projected 4,000 premature deaths as a result of the disaster. The IAEA based this 4,000 figure on its estimate of a 3% increase in cancers in the regions surrounding the plant, first adopting it at the 1986 conference after rejecting the finding of 40,000 projected deaths that Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official Chernobyl disaster commission—had estimated based upon his team's research. Greenpeace have projected up to a million excess, cancer-related deaths from the Chernobyl disaster. The Chernobyl Forum, the WHO, and other international agencies do not accept this number. Methodological debates \nThe use of differing, contested methods to identify and tally deaths—including anticipated deaths due to long-latency diseases—has also contributed to the wide range of estimates of the Chernobyl disaster's death toll. Indeed, at the August 1986 meeting of the first international conference on the disaster, the IAEA scaled down from 40,000 to 4,000 the projected disaster-related deaths estimate of Valery Legasov—inorganic chemist and a lead investigator of the Soviet Union's official commission—after objecting to Legasov's use of a statistical model based on radiation data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Similarly, some theoretical estimates of the disaster's deaths are disputed on the grounds that they rely upon contested models such as the linear no-threshold model (LNT) or hormesis in order to compare the disaster's estimated cancer rates to background rates of cancer.

This is Baltimore's most recent World Series championship, and also their most recent appearance in a World Series. This was the first World Series since 1956 in which the teams did not use air travel, as Baltimore and Philadelphia are approximately 100 mi apart. This win by Palmer, along with his first World Series win in 1966, marks the longest span (17 years) over World Series wins for an individual pitcher in major league history. It was the first World Series game in which three Cy Young Award winners, Carlton, Palmer and Orioles' starter Mike Flanagan, pitched. This would not happen again until Game 1 of the 2012 Series, when Barry Zito, Tim Lincecum and Justin Verlander appeared. Steve Carlton became the first 300-game winner to pitch in a World Series in 55 years (Grover Cleveland Alexander was the last).

The Internet is a relatively new phenomenon. The Internet developed from the ARPANET, dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The World Wide Web as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when graphical interface and services like email became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and commerce. Internet Explorer was first released in 1995; Netscape a year earlier. Google was founded in 1998. Wikipedia was founded in 2001. Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube in the mid-2000s. The amount of information available on the net and the number of Internet users worldwide has continued to grow rapidly. Bahrain has been connected to the internet since 1995 with the country's domain suffix is '.bh'. The Internet in Laos was first introduced in 1997, with the two commercial ISP services starting in 1999, specifically PlaNet Computers and GlobeNet.

The Internet developed from the ARPANET, dating back to 1969; as a term it was coined in 1974. The World Wide Web as we know it was shaped in the mid-1990s, when graphical interface and services like email became popular and reached wider (non-scientific and non-military) audiences and commerce. Internet Explorer was first released in 1995; Netscape a year earlier. Google was founded in 1998. Wikipedia was founded in 2001. Facebook, MySpace, and YouTube in the mid-2000s. The amount of information available on the net and the number of Internet users worldwide has continued to grow rapidly. Bahrain has been connected to the internet since 1995 with the country's domain suffix is '.bh'. The Internet in Laos was first introduced in 1997, with the two commercial ISP services starting in 1999, specifically PlaNet Computers and GlobeNet. These services supported a rapid growth of internet cafes across the country to service tourists, which incidentally introduced the internet to many English speaking Lao nationals.\n\n"

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Crawford's first husband, stated, \"The Joan Crawford that I've heard about in Mommie Dearest is not the Joan Crawford I knew back then.\" The two younger Crawford children, Cindy and Cathy, born in 1947 and also adopted by Crawford, have stated categorically many times that they did not witness or experience any of the events that were described \n\n me and he loved me. She also spoke on her wishes to have a son with the rapper. Wayne's daughter is just wonderful. Nivea credited Wayne as being her first love. In August 2003, Lil Wayne called off his engagement to Nivea. Nivea married R&B singer and producer Terius \"The-Dream\" Nash in December 2004. Their daughter Navy Talia Nash was born on May \n\n Crawford was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to Rich (who commutes between Oklahoma and California while running a pet sales business) and Jennifer Crawford. He started acting lessons in Oklahoma when he was only 5 years old. Gary Lewis is the son of Jerry Lewis and singer Patti Palmer. His mother, who was performing at the time with the Ted Fio Rito Orchestra, intended to name him after her favorite actor, Cary Grant, but her son became \"Gary\" as the result of a clerical error. When he was 18, Lewis formed the band \"Gary and the Playboys\" with four friends.\n\n"

Dodi's mother was the Saudi Arabian author Samira Khashoggi; her father was Muhammad Khashoggi, who was of Turkish descent, and brother to the Saudi billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. Fayed was a student at Collège Saint Marc before attending the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. Fayed was the first cousin of the late Washington Post Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. Fayed also worked for his father on Harrods' marketing. British cash-for-questions affair, which began when The Guardian newspaper alleged that London's most successful parliamentary lobbyist, Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. By the mid 1970s Costain had gained over £280 million of contracts thanks to Al-Fayed and Al Tajir. Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain's future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development. Alabbar had been appointed by Sheikh Maktoum to eradicate the system of large commission \n\n In 1986, the town briefly changed its name to \"Harrodsville\". This was a protest in support of a restaurateur, Henry Harrod of Palmerston North, who was being forced to change the name of his restaurant following the threat of lawsuits from Mohamed Al Fayed, the then owner of Harrod's department store in London. After being lampooned in the British tabloids, Al Fayed dropped the legal action and Harrodsville and its shops reverted to their former names.\n\nQuestion: In which North African country was Mohammed Al-Fayed, owner of Harrods department store in London, born?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Dodi's father was also the former owner of Fulham Football Club and the Hôtel Ritz Paris. Dodi's mother was the Saudi Arabian author Samira Khashoggi; her father was Muhammad Khashoggi, who was of Turkish descent, and brother to the Saudi billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. Fayed was a student at Collège Saint Marc before attending the Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland. Fayed was the first cousin of the late Washington Post Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who was assassinated in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey in 2018. Fayed also worked for his father on Harrods' marketing. British cash-for-questions affair, which began when The Guardian newspaper alleged that London's most successful parliamentary lobbyist, Ian Greer of Ian Greer Associates, had bribed two Conservative Members of Parliament in exchange for asking parliamentary questions, and other tasks, on behalf of the Egyptian owner of Harrods department store, Mohamed Al-Fayed. Al-Fayed also assisted with securing the financing for the Dubai World Trade Centre. By the mid 1970s Costain had gained over £280 million of contracts thanks to Al-Fayed and Al Tajir. Al Tajir's influence in Dubai was waning by 1977, and Al-Fayed was excluded from the commission process for a new aluminium smelter, and the development of Jebel Ali, putting Costain's future profits at risk. In 1993 Al-Fayed was visited at his department store Harrods by Mohammed Alabbar, the director of Dubai's Department of Economic Development. Alabbar had been appointed by Sheikh Maktoum to eradicate the system of large commission \n\n In 1986, the town briefly changed its name to \"Harrodsville\". This was a protest in support of a restaurateur, Henry Harrod of Palmerston North, who was being forced to change the name of his restaurant following the threat of lawsuits from Mohamed Al Fayed, the then owner of Harrod's department store in London. After being lampooned in the British tabloids, Al Fayed dropped the legal action and Harrodsville and its shops reverted to their former names.\n\n"

As defined by the United States Department of War, the South West Pacific theatre included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (excluding Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, the Australian Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago), the western part of the Solomon Islands and some neighbouring territories. It was a war of logistics, with American home bases in California and Hawaii sending supplies to Australia. Island hopping was the key strategy to bypass heavily fortified Japanese positions and instead concentrate the limited Allied resources on strategically important islands that were not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of Japan. This strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and \n\n control of the southeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean.

During World War II, the United States captured the islands from Japan. The War of the Pacific (Guerra del Pacífico), also known as the Saltpeter War (Guerra del salitre) and by multiple other names, was a war between Chile and a Bolivian–Peruvian alliance from 1879 to 1884.

        "context": " During World War II, the United States Army Air Forces engaged in combat against the air, ground and naval forces of the Empire of Japan in the South West Pacific Theatre. As defined by the United States Department of War, the South West Pacific theatre included the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies (excluding Sumatra), Borneo, Australia, the Australian Territory of New Guinea (including the Bismarck Archipelago), the western part of the Solomon Islands and some neighbouring territories. It was a war of logistics, with American home bases in California and Hawaii sending supplies to Australia. Island hopping was the key strategy to bypass heavily fortified Japanese positions and instead concentrate the limited Allied resources on strategically important islands that were not well defended but capable of supporting the drive to the main islands of Japan. This strategy was possible in part because the Allies used submarine and air attacks to blockade and \n\n control of the southeastern portion of the Pacific Ocean. Sater cites Germany's minister in Chile, who argued that the war with Peru and Bolivia would \"have erupted sooner or later, [and] on any pretext.\" He considered that Bolivia and Peru had developed a \"bitter envy\" against Chile and its material \n\n  The Governor of the South Seas Mandate (officially known as the Director of the South Sea Agency) was an official who administered the South Seas Mandate, a Class C League of Nations mandate in the Pacific Ocean under the administration of the Empire of Japan, as part of the Japanese colonial empire, between 1922 and 1944. During World War II, the United States captured the islands from Japan. The War of the Pacific (Guerra del Pacífico), also known as the Saltpeter War (Guerra del salitre) and by multiple other names, was a war between Chile and a Bolivian–Peruvian alliance from 1879 to 1884. The war began over a nitrate taxation dispute between Bolivia and Chile, with Peru being drawn in due to its alliance with Bolivia.\n\n"

The Canadian town of Hawkesbury, Ontario, the Hawkesbury River and the Liverpool Plains, New South Wales, Australia, Liverpool, New South Wales, and the Liverpool River in the Northern Territory of Australia were also named after Lord Liverpool. Lord Liverpool, as Prime Minister to whose government Nathan Mayer Rothschild was a lender, was portrayed by American actor Gilbert Emery in the 1934 movie, The House of Rothschild.

During the early years of the primetime 'specials', Walters secured the first joint interview with Egypt's President Anwar Sadat and Israel's Prime Minister Menachem Begin. The specials continued to air sporadically throughout the year and saw Walters conduct interviews with a plethora of public and political figures including former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The top person for the year was Hillary Clinton. Initially, 2013 was to be Walters' final installment of the special, which happened to end with the same person as in the debut year; however, Barbara continued the program in both 2014 and 2015.\n\n became the chief executive officer of the Potsdam Paper Corporation. In May 1981, President of the United States Ronald Reagan nominated Walters to be Assistant Secretary of the Army (Manpower and Reserve Affairs). She went on to become White House correspondent during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. At the Republican Convention of 1980, she broke the news on CBS that Reagan's negotiations with ex-President Gerald Ford had broken down and the answer to the question of who would be vice-presidential nominee was: \"It's Bush! George H. W. Bush had been standing perhaps not far away, largely off by himself, looking discouraged because he was sure he wasn't going to be chosen.

She reported on the U.S./Russian summit meetings and the economic summits of the industrialized countries, as well as the national political conventions and election nights throughout her career. In 2020, she gained much media attention for her interview with President Donald Trump in which he stopped the interview short and walked out due to his objections to her warning him about \"tough questions\" which he believed were \"inappropriate\". This marked the first of 28 consecutive years where a Barbara Walters interview special aired before the ceremony. Walters had previously aired an interview special in 1981 and, in subsequent years, her special aired prior to the Academy's formal broadcast of celebrities walking the red carpet.\n\n"

Tsar Alexei Mikhailovich officially extended the name to encompass the entire square, which had previously been called Pozhar, or \"burnt-out place\", reflecting that previous buildings occupying the site had burned down.\n\n"

With the Kuomintang's defeat & retreat to Taiwan, Mao Zedong established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on October 1, 1949.\n\n the Chinese Communists were able to fill the political vacuum left in Manchuria after Soviet forces withdrew from the area and thus gained China's prime industrial base. On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic of China (PRC). Chiang Kai-shek and 600,000 Nationalist troops and 2 million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from the mainland to the island of Taiwan.\n\n"

Winston Churchill, who had long warned against Nazi Germany and demanded rearmament, became prime minister after his predecessor Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement had totally collapsed and Britain was unable to reverse the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. He called for the United Kingdom and United States to join together to deny raw material to aggressive nations. During the Second World War Edwards kept up pressure on the Government to assist industry. In 1941 he proposed that all import duties be abolished, and \n\n  Just after the outbreak of the Second World War the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, summoned Trenchard and offered him the job of organising advanced training for RAF pilots in Canada, possibly as a pretext to remove Trenchard from England. He then spent the remainder of 1939 arguing that the RAF should be used to strike against Germany from its bases in France. In 1940 he was offered the job of co-ordinating the camouflaging of England, which he flatly refused.\n\n"

Shearing also opens fresh coal surfaces exposing reactive molecular species, which participate in new bond-forming reactions and liberate some chemically trapped moisture. As the pellets densify, the newly formed structure shrinks, resulting in a significantly more compact microstructure compared to the original coal.

The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses. In practice, as noted, these are surface-contact forces between objects. Such forces cause stresses and strains on objects, since they must be transmitted from an object surface. Because of these strains, large g-forces may \n\n of the seat, and it results in a g-force toward the ground.

However, one factor that friction does not depend on is the material composition of the surfaces in contact. By considering these factors, we can better understand and predict the frictional forces between objects.\n\n"

The density of vein terminations, denoted as ρ, can be estimated from published data on leaf vein density. Each subclavian vein is a continuation of the axillary vein and runs from the outer border of the first rib to the medial border of anterior scalene muscle. From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \"innominate vein\"). The angle of union is termed the venous angle. The subclavian vein follows the subclavian artery and is separated from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. Thus, the subclavian vein lies anterior to the anterior scalene while the subclavian artery lies posterior to the anterior scalene (and anterior to the middle scalene). As the subclavian vein is large, central and relatively superficial, the right subclavian vein is often used to place central venous lines. It is less commonly used than other approaches, such as the right internal jugular vein, due to the risk of pneumothorax, haemothorax, and puncture of the accompanying subclavian artery. The superior thalamic vein (vena superioris thalami), initially called by Benno Shlesinger in 1976 the principal thalamic vein (vena principalis thalami) or centro-medial thalamic vein (vena centro-medialis thalami), also called by Russian surgeon Pirogoff internal thalamic vein (vena interioris thalami) is the most prominent vein of the thalamus. It shows great interindividual anatomic variations. The larva bores in the vein, descending towards the midrib. The larva may move from one thick vein to another with a thin transverse corridor.

The density of vein terminations, denoted as ρ, can be estimated from published data on leaf vein density. Each subclavian vein is a continuation of the axillary vein and runs from the outer border of the first rib to the medial border of anterior scalene muscle. From here it joins with the internal jugular vein to form the brachiocephalic vein (also known as \"innominate vein\"). The angle of union is termed the venous angle. The subclavian vein follows the subclavian artery and is separated from the subclavian artery by the insertion of anterior scalene. Thus, the subclavian vein lies anterior to the anterior scalene while the subclavian artery lies posterior to the anterior scalene (and anterior to the middle scalene). As the subclavian vein is large, central and relatively superficial, the right subclavian vein is often used to place central venous lines. It is less commonly used than other approaches, such as the right internal jugular vein, due to the risk of pneumothorax, haemothorax, and puncture of the accompanying subclavian artery. The superior thalamic vein (vena superioris thalami), initially called by Benno Shlesinger in 1976 the principal thalamic vein (vena principalis thalami) or centro-medial thalamic vein (vena centro-medialis thalami), also called by Russian surgeon Pirogoff internal thalamic vein (vena interioris thalami) is the most prominent vein of the thalamus. It shows great interindividual anatomic variations. The larva bores in the vein, descending towards the midrib. The larva may move from one thick vein to another with a thin transverse corridor. From the midrib, the larva descends into the petiole.\n\n"

However, it's important to note that in some individuals, one or all four of the third molars may not develop completely. The eruption sequence begins with the first molars around the sixth year, followed by the two central incisors around the seventh year, the two lateral incisors around the eighth year, the first premolars around the ninth year, the second premolars around the tenth year, the canines between the eleventh and twelfth years, the second molars between the twelfth and thirteenth years, and finally, the third molars between the seventeenth and twenty-fifth years.

The pancreas plays a crucial role in the regulation of glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is responsible for lowering blood sugar levels. When blood glucose rises, such as after a meal or due to glycogen conversion, beta cells in the pancreas release insulin into the bloodstream. On the other hand, glucagon, which is released by alpha cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect of raising blood sugar levels. Many tissues monitor the levels of glucose in the blood, but pancreatic islet cells are particularly important in this process. When blood glucose levels deviate from the desired range, the pancreas adjusts insulin and glucagon secretion accordingly to restore balance. In summary, blood sugar levels are regulated through a complex interplay of hormones, primarily insulin and glucagon, secreted by the pancreas. Insulin, which lowers blood sugar,  and glucagon, which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process. The gland called pancreas secrete two hormones and they are primarily responsible to regulate glucose levels in blood. The pancreas is an important organ with multiple functions and components. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions. Insulin helps lower blood sugar levels by promoting the uptake of glucose into cells, while glucagon increases blood sugar levels by stimulating the release of stored glucose from the liver. The exocrine function of the pancreas involves the production and secretion of digestive enzymes. Now, let's talk about the relation between the pancreas and diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Proper functioning of the pancreas is crucial for regulating blood sugar levels and managing diabetes mellitus. It is not directly related to the pancreas but involves a different hormone called vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone or ADH) that is produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland. The pancreas is not directly involved in diabetes insipidus. To summarize, the pancreas plays a vital role in the regulation of blood sugar levels through its production and secretion of insulin and glucagon. While the malfunction of the pancreas is closely associated with diabetes mellitus, it is not directly involved in diabetes insipidus. Simultaneously the compound reduces the elevated glucagon secretion by inhibiting alpha cells of the pancreas, as glucagon is known to be inappropriately elevated in diabetic patients. When blood glucose levels are low, alpha cells secrete glucagon into the bloodstream. This process is called gluconeogenesis. When blood glucose levels drop, the pancreas senses this decrease and signals the alpha cells to release glucagon. It's important to note that while glucagon raises blood sugar levels, another hormone called insulin, secreted by beta cells in the pancreas, has the opposite effect. In conclusion, glucagon is secreted by alpha cells in the pancreas and plays a significant role in regulating blood sugar levels by increasing glucose production and release from the liver.\n\nQuestion: What is secreted by the pancreas to regulate blood sugar levels?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The underlying reason may be premature ovarian failure (when the ovaries stop functioning prior to the onset of natural menopause); polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), when the ovaries do not regularly release an egg or do not release a viable egg; blocked fallopian tubes; physical problems with the uterine wall; or uterine fibroids. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), assisted reproductive technology includes all fertility treatments in which both the sperm and eggs are handled during the treatment. Most ART procedures involve surgically removing eggs from a woman's ovaries, combining them with sperm in the laboratory, and returning them to the woman's body or donating them to another woman. The woman takes a drug that causes the ovaries to produce multiple eggs. Once mature, the eggs are removed and put in a dish in the lab along with the man's sperm for fertilization. There are two different approaches to artificial insemination. So we pop an egg out of an ovary every month and call it ovulation, right? When monthly bleeding ends, the hypothalamus secretes a hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland in the brain to release a follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). What is the Function of the Ovary? The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive organs. The size of each ovary is about 1.5 inches long. The ovaries are connected to each other by the tubes called fallopian tubes. The body may have a false surge, where it does not actually release an egg, so relying solely on an OPK may leave you disappointed. The day of ovulation (when a ripened egg bursts out of its follicle) and the five days before it are the fertile window of the female reproductive cycle. The day before and the day of ovulation are the most fertile days; more than 80% of viable pregnancies are conceived on those two days. If an egg becomes fertilized, it will take 5-6 days to reach the lining of the uterus and implant within its lining. If an egg remains unfertilized, it travels with the endometrium (thickened uterine lining) as it is shed at the start of the menstrual cycle. The luteal phase is named for the corpus luteum, which is what’s left of the follicle that was housing the egg that got released at ovulation. The corpus luteum produces progesterone, which your body needs to ripen the endometrium (uterine lining). The ripening of the uterine lining happens every cycle after an egg is released, whether or not the egg is fertilized. Knowing your luteal phase length is important; a LP that is under 11 days generally cannot support a fertilized egg.\n\nQuestion: When the egg is released from the ovary, what is left behind?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

If the SA node does not function properly and is unable to control the heart rate, a group of cells further down the heart will become the ectopic pacemaker of the heart. The cells of the AV node normally discharge at about 40-60 beats per minute, and are called the secondary pacemaker. It is important to realize that these cells will be initiating action potentials and contraction at a much lower rate than the primary or secondary pacemaker cells. This cost can be less or more depending upon the hospital, experience of doctors, quality and type of pacemaker used and many more parameters. Patients suffering a strong heart attack or arrhythmia needs pacemaker implantation. What is a pacemaker device? What are the different types of Pacemakers used in implantation in India? Why is pacemaker implantation required? What happens during Pacemaker Implantation? A pacemaker is a kind of a medical device, which is used to normalize and regulate the rhythm of the heart. This type of pacemaker helps with initial stabilization of a heart patient at the time of cardiac arrest. This type of pacemaker is responsible for increasing the pace of the heart rate to help meet the body’s changing needs. This pacemaker carries signals to and from one particular chamber of the heart, which is either the right ventricle or the right atrium. The pacemaker has two leads that can monitor and eventually deliver impulses to or from the heart chambers. Patients suffering from a heart disease, damage to the heart due to aging or heart muscle problems, heart block, and bradycardia atrial fibrillation need pacemaker implantation. Patients should be aware of all these guidelines and they should approach their cardiologist for the same. Permanent pacemakers are required for patients suffering from recurring and chronic conditions such as symptomatic brady-arrhythmia. Electrophysiologists or specially trained cardiologists perform pacemaker implantation procedure. A cardiologist or electrophysiologist uses fluoroscopy imaging for implanting the pacemaker device at the designated location inside the heart. After the cardiologist connects the leads to the pacemaker and the heart, he tests the device to ensure that the electrical impulses are carried to the heart from the pacemaker. He finally makes sure that the patient’s heart rhythm and heart rate is being read accurately and goes on normally. Q: What are the symptoms if a pacemaker is failing? Q: What is the reason you need a pacemaker? Q: What are the reasons of pacemaker failure? Q: You have a pacemaker. A pacemaker is not a cure for heart disease. A pacemaker delivers energy to stimulate the heart muscle to beat. Q: What are the side effects of a pacemaker? Q: Can I use household appliances if I have a pacemaker? But there is a possibility that they may interfere with the proper operation of your pacemaker. Q: What is the most common age for pacemaker implantation? They hold a great expertise in conducting comprehensive heart care treatment and follow-up cardiac treatments. The pacemaker implantation hospitals in India have a highly trained group of electrophysiologists. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically.\n\nQuestion: What is the scientific name for the heart's pacemaker?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This cost can be less or more depending upon the hospital, experience of doctors, quality and type of pacemaker used and many more parameters. Patients suffering a strong heart attack or arrhythmia needs pacemaker implantation. What is a pacemaker device? What are the different types of Pacemakers used in implantation in India? Why is pacemaker implantation required? What happens during Pacemaker Implantation? A pacemaker is a kind of a medical device, which is used to normalize and regulate the rhythm of the heart. This type of pacemaker helps with initial stabilization of a heart patient at the time of cardiac arrest. This type of pacemaker is responsible for increasing the pace of the heart rate to help meet the body’s changing needs. This pacemaker carries signals to and from one particular chamber of the heart, which is either the right ventricle or the right atrium. The pacemaker has two leads that can monitor and eventually deliver impulses to or from the heart chambers. Patients suffering from a heart disease, damage to the heart due to aging or heart muscle problems, heart block, and bradycardia atrial fibrillation need pacemaker implantation. Patients should be aware of all these guidelines and they should approach their cardiologist for the same. Permanent pacemakers are required for patients suffering from recurring and chronic conditions such as symptomatic brady-arrhythmia. Electrophysiologists or specially trained cardiologists perform pacemaker implantation procedure. A cardiologist or electrophysiologist uses fluoroscopy imaging for implanting the pacemaker device at the designated location inside the heart. After the cardiologist connects the leads to the pacemaker and the heart, he tests the device to ensure that the electrical impulses are carried to the heart from the pacemaker. He finally makes sure that the patient’s heart rhythm and heart rate is being read accurately and goes on normally. Q: What are the symptoms if a pacemaker is failing? Q: What is the reason you need a pacemaker? Q: What are the reasons of pacemaker failure? Q: You have a pacemaker. A pacemaker is not a cure for heart disease. A pacemaker delivers energy to stimulate the heart muscle to beat. Q: What are the side effects of a pacemaker? Q: Can I use household appliances if I have a pacemaker? But there is a possibility that they may interfere with the proper operation of your pacemaker. Q: What is the most common age for pacemaker implantation? They hold a great expertise in conducting comprehensive heart care treatment and follow-up cardiac treatments. The pacemaker implantation hospitals in India have a highly trained group of electrophysiologists. The cells that create these rhythmic impulses, setting the pace for blood pumping, are called pacemaker cells, and they directly control the heart rate. They make up the cardiac pacemaker, that is, the natural pacemaker of the heart. In most humans, the concentration of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker, and the resultant rhythm is a sinus rhythm. Sometimes an ectopic pacemaker sets the pace, if the SA node is damaged or if the electrical conduction system of the heart has problems. In humans, and sometimes in other animals, a mechanical device called an artificial pacemaker (or simply \"pacemaker\") may be used after damage to the body's intrinsic conduction system to produce these impulses synthetically.\n\n"

They allow us to manage the mare's oestrus cycle in various ways. Predictable and synchronized ovulation: Hormone analogues such as Chorulon contain human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle and the formation of a corpus luteum (CL). This helps in predicting and synchronizing ovulation, making it easier to plan breeding and artificial insemination. Induction of ovulation: Hormones can be used to induce ovulation in mares, which can be particularly useful in cases where natural ovulation is delayed or irregular. This technique can improve the chances of successful conception. Assistance in high-risk pregnancies: Reproductive hormones can assist in the maintenance of high-risk pregnancies. It is important to note that the use of reproductive hormones should always be done under close veterinary supervision to ensure the best results and the mare's overall well-being. This positive feedback loop causes LH to spike sharply, and it is this spike that causes ovulation. Following ovulation, LH stimulates the formation of the corpus luteum. Estrogen has since dropped to negative stimulatory levels after ovulation and therefore serves to maintain the concentration of FSH and LH. Inhibin, which is also secreted by the corpus luteum, contributes to FSH inhibition. However, coordinated enzyme signalling and the time-specific expression of hormonal receptors ensures that follicle growth does not become disregulated during these premature spikes. It is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH antagonist) with the generic name Ganirelix, similar to Antagon. This medication can help control ovulation, helping time the release of eggs so that they are mature and ready for IVF. Normally this GnRH will control the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), which in turn causes ovulation, the release of eggs. When the drug blocks the GnRH, the luteinizing hormone is not released, so ovulation does not occur. When doctors do want to trigger ovulation, they can stop injecting this medication and administer human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to trigger ovulation. This helps to control the timing of ovulation until after the eggs have properly matured. Ovulation induction is the is the use of fertility drugs to stimulate production of multiple follicles in the ovaries, which produce eggs. Drugs such as Clomid pills or gonadotropin injections can induce ovulation, treating infertility. We help women order affordable Orgalutran and other fertility drugs, with free express shipping in an insulated styrofoam cooler for product quality. You can order this medication online or by phoning our customer service hotline, then one of our partner pharmacies will ship your order so you can control your ovulation for the best chance at pregnancy success. Ganirelix is a gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRH antagonist) that works by blocking receptors for the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which normally controls the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and triggers ovulation. However, premature ovulation can hinder the success of IVF. This medication is usually prescribed to women undergoing IVF or other assisted reproductive techniques (ART). The dosage and administration of Ganirelix will be determined by your fertility doctor. Typically, the medication is started around five or six days after beginning ovarian stimulation treatments using follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). It is usually administered as a daily injection until the follicles are large enough to release a mature egg. If ovulation needs to be triggered, the injections of Ganirelix can be stopped, and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) can be administered to induce ovulation. This helps to ensure that the timing of ovulation is controlled until the eggs have properly matured. Please consult your fertility doctor for personalized advice and instructions regarding Ganirelix and its use in your specific IVF treatment. The contraceptive effect of birth control pills containing both synthetic estrogen and progestin is thought to be primarily due to the inhibition of ovulation. These medications work by suppressing the natural hormonal fluctuations involved in the menstrual cycle, which ultimately prevents the release of an egg from the ovaries. By inhibiting ovulation, birth control pills effectively reduce the chances of fertilization and pregnancy. By preventing the surge of LH, progestin plays a crucial role in suppressing ovulation. In addition to inhibiting ovulation, birth control pills also create changes in the cervical mucus and uterine lining that make it difficult for sperm to reach the egg or for a fertilized egg to implant in the uterus if fertilization does occur. Overall, by inhibiting ovulation and making the reproductive environment less conducive to fertilization and implantation, birth control pills containing both synthetic estrogen and progestin effectively provide contraception.\n\nQuestion: Which hormone helps control ovulation?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

AGE is potentially more dangerous than Decompression Sickness (DCS) as the arterial circulation is designed to quickly and efficiently carry oxygen and nutrients to key body tissues but unfortunately, in the case of an arterial gas embolism, it also carries the gas embolism directly to the key body tissues and in particular the brain. Unlike DCS it can even present itself while the diver is still surfacing. Bubbles of air will become trapped within the tissues of the lung. Divers suffering from Interstitial Emphysema are likely to show a shortness of breath, they may have difficulty swallowing and there may be a swollen appearance at the base of the neck. PNEUMOTHORAX\n\nPneumo is Greek for Air and the Thorax is your chest cavity. This allows gas to escape from the lungs into the pleural space.The pressure can also affect the heart and major blood vessels and so affect the circulation and even cause the heart to stop.Divers suffering from Pneumothorax are likely to show a shortness of breath, they may be coughing blood and may report pain on breathing.The chest area may also appear swollen or distorted and the reduced lung function may result in signs of cyanosis. These foramina allow for the escape of CSF from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space. The C-shaped lateral ventricles follow the growth of the telencephalon (part of the forebrain) and have limited access into the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen of Monro. The subarachnoid space is the area between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater, and it surrounds the brain and spinal cord. CSF circulates within the subarachnoid space, providing buoyancy and protection for the central nervous system. After circulating within the subarachnoid space, CSF reenters the venous system through structures called arachnoid granulations. Arachnoid granulations act as one-way valves, allowing CSF to drain from the subarachnoid space into the dural sinuses, especially the superior sagittal sinus. In summary, the foramina of Magendie and Luschka permit the escape of CSF from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space.\n\nQuestion: From which areas of space can there be no escape?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Such ships also tend to include \"coldsleep\" \n\nThis allows gas to escape from the lungs into the pleural space.Pneumothorax is caused when excess gas pressure in the lungs causes the lining of the lung to rupture as well as the alveoli.The space between the lining of the lungs and the chest wall is called the pleural space and is normally airtight.PNEUMOTHORAX\n\nPneumo is Greek for Air and the Thorax is your chest cavity.However experiments that introduced vapour locks into the ventricular chamber of a dog showed that this does not produce cardiac arrest. AGE is potentially more dangerous than Decompression Sickness (DCS) as the arterial circulation is designed to quickly and efficiently carry oxygen and nutrients to key body tissues but unfortunately, in the case of an arterial gas embolism, it also carries the gas embolism directly to the key body tissues and in particular the brain. Unlike DCS it can even present itself while the diver is still surfacing. Bubbles of air will become trapped within the tissues of the lung. Divers suffering from Interstitial Emphysema are likely to show a shortness of breath, they may have difficulty swallowing and there may be a swollen appearance at the base of the neck. PNEUMOTHORAX\n\nPneumo is Greek for Air and the Thorax is your chest cavity. This allows gas to escape from the lungs into the pleural space.The pressure can also affect the heart and major blood vessels and so affect the circulation and even cause the heart to stop.Divers suffering from Pneumothorax are likely to show a shortness of breath, they may be coughing blood and may report pain on breathing.The chest area may also appear swollen or distorted and the reduced lung function may result in signs of cyanosis. These foramina allow for the escape of CSF from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space. The C-shaped lateral ventricles follow the growth of the telencephalon (part of the forebrain) and have limited access into the third ventricle through the interventricular foramen of Monro. The subarachnoid space is the area between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater, and it surrounds the brain and spinal cord. CSF circulates within the subarachnoid space, providing buoyancy and protection for the central nervous system. After circulating within the subarachnoid space, CSF reenters the venous system through structures called arachnoid granulations. Arachnoid granulations act as one-way valves, allowing CSF to drain from the subarachnoid space into the dural sinuses, especially the superior sagittal sinus. In summary, the foramina of Magendie and Luschka permit the escape of CSF from the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space.\n\n"

The physical dimensions of colour include wavelength, intensity and purity while the related perceptual dimensions include hue, brightness and saturation. The system will put together the information and systematize a new colour based on the amount of each hue that has been detected. In a letter written to Count Semyon Romanovich Vorontsov (1792), Miranda recounted how Goethe, fascinated with his exploits throughout the Americas and Europe, told him, \"Your destiny is to create in your land a place where primary colours are not distorted.” He proceeded to clarify what he meant:First he explained to me the way the iris transforms the light into the three primary colours... then he said, \"Why yellow is the most warm, noble and closest to the bright light; why Blue is that mix of excitement and serenity, so far that it evokes the shadows; and why Red is the exaltation of Yellow and Blue, the synthesis, the vanishing of the bright light into the shadows\".\n\n"

The club became the first British team and only Scottish team to date to win the European Cup, by beating Inter Milan in the 1967 final. The team that defeated Inter at the final held at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon have since become known as \"The Lisbon Lions\". Although dominated by teams from England or representing Great Britain, the award has been won twice by Scottish teams; Celtic in 1967, after they became the first British football club to win the European Cup, and the 1990 Grand Slam winning Scotland rugby union squad. The club's involvement in European competition dates back to the 1950s. Some cities entered a select team including players from more than one club, but Aston Villa, the other major club based in the city of Birmingham, rejected the opportunity to field a combined team.

He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development.

        "context": " Alfred Bernhard Nobel (, ; 21 October 1833 – 10 December 1896) was a Swedish chemist, engineer, inventor, businessman, and philanthropist. He is best known for having bequeathed his fortune to establish the Nobel Prize, though he also made several important contributions to science, holding 355 patents in his lifetime. Nobel's most famous invention was dynamite, a safer and easier means of harnessing the explosive power of nitroglycerin; it was patented in 1867 and was soon used worldwide for mining and infrastructure development.

These are still by far the most common and popular types, but some vendors have started to offer a number of other flavors such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like \"Chakalaka\", \"Currywurst\", \"Pommes\" (french fries), \"Rot-weiss\" (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise).\n\n"

Conditions that temporarily disqualify a person include malaria (if it has been less than 3 years since the person last experienced symptoms), cancer that has been treated with surgery or radiation (if it has been less than 5 years since the person last received treatment), pregnancy, recent major surgery, poorly controlled high blood pressure, low blood pressure, anemia, the use of certain drugs, exposure to some forms of hepatitis, and a recent blood transfusion. A person's blood type is determined by the presence or absence of certain proteins (Rh factor and blood group antigens A and B) on the surface of red blood cells. The four main blood types are A, B, AB, and O, and for each type, the blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. For example, a person with O-negative blood has red blood cells that lack both A and B antigens and the Rh factor. Some blood types are far more common than others. The most common blood types in the United States are O-positive and A-positive, followed by B-positive, O-negative, A-negative, AB-positive, B-negative, and AB-negative. Hence an individual with \"Type A\" blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different \"A\" alleles.)

It is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of inherited antigenic substances on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs). Blood types predict whether a serious reaction will occur in a blood transfusion. When a blood transfusion or an organ transplant takes place, it is vital to know the blood types of the donor (who gives blood) and the receiver (who needs blood). There are a number of human blood group systems. Of these systems, the ABO blood group system and the Rhesus blood group system are the most important. So, people may produce antibodies against A and/or B antigens if they are not in their blood. These antibodies clump red blood cells together if they carry the foreign antigens. This harsh response can cause death when large amounts of such cells are encountered after a blood transfusion. Because A and B antigens are chemically modified from a precursor form that is also present in type O individuals, people with type A and B antigens can accept blood from type O individuals. In a laboratory, blood is tested for antigens. When a certain antigen is found, there are also always antibodies found. Group O have no antigens, but have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Blood group AB have no antibodies, so they can receive blood from any blood group. Rh is an inherited trait, which refers to a protein on the surface of an individual's red blood cells. In blood transfusions it is important that the blood donor and recipient have the same Rh factor and same blood group.

He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at \n\n Whitewebbs has links with the Gunpowder Plot, as Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators are known to have used a safe house in Whitewebbs Lane, Enfield. It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames. Acts of regicide were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to the continent, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.\n\nQuestion: Which King did Guy Fawkes attempt to kill with his gunpowder plot?\nAnswer: <|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

        "context": " Guy Fawkes (13 April 1570 – 31 January 1606), also known as Guido Fawkes while fighting for the Spanish, was a member of a group of provincial English Catholics who was involved in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. He was born and educated in York; his father died when Fawkes was eight years old, after which his mother married a recusant Catholic. Fawkes converted to Catholicism and left for mainland Europe, where he fought for Catholic Spain in the Eighty Years' War against Protestant Dutch reformers in the Low Countries. Its history begins with the events of 5 November 1605, when Guy Fawkes, a member of the Gunpowder Plot, was arrested while guarding explosives the plotters had placed beneath the House of Lords. Celebrating the fact that King James I had survived the attempt on his life, people lit bonfires around London; and months later, the introduction of the Observance of 5th November Act enforced an annual public day of thanksgiving for the plot's failure. The present-day Guy Fawkes Night is usually celebrated at \n\n Whitewebbs has links with the Gunpowder Plot, as Guy Fawkes and his fellow conspirators are known to have used a safe house in Whitewebbs Lane, Enfield. It is uncertain when Fawkes returned to England, but he was back in London by late August 1605, when he and Wintour discovered that the gunpowder stored in the undercroft had decayed. He was to light the fuse and then escape across the Thames. Acts of regicide were frowned upon, and Fawkes would therefore head to the continent, where he would explain to the Catholic powers his holy duty to kill the King and his retinue.\n\n"

It is uncertain when or how, or into what form, a dæmon is \"born\", but a baby's dæmon takes the form of a baby animal. How a dæmon acquires a name is not explained in the books, but clarified by Philip Pullman as being normally given by the parents' dæmons. As Will Parry came from our world, his dæmon was not given a name in this way and was named Kirjava (meaning mottled in Finnish) by Serafina Pekkala when she first met the dæmon.

Collodion baby is the name given to a baby who is born encased in a skin that resembles a yellow, tight and shiny film or dried collodion (sausage skin). These babies are often premature. It is due to mutation of certain genes and is usually an autosomal recessive, congenital ichthyosis (scaly skin condition). However, 10% of collodion babies have normal underlying skin – a mild presentation known as ‘self-healing’ collodion baby. What are the complications of the collodion membrane? What is the management of a collodion baby? The baby is usually transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). An incubator provides a humidified, neutral temperature environment. The life expectancy and difficulties that the collodion baby faces depend upon the particular underlying condition. What Is Bartholin's Gland Cyst? Treatment involves surgically removing or marsupializing the cyst. A catheter can be inserted to drain the abscess or marsupialization may be done initially to treat the abscess or later to prevent the cyst from refilling.

The Pilbara ningaui is considered to be of similar size and weight. It is uncertain when or how, or into what form, a dæmon is \"born\", but a baby's dæmon takes the form of a baby animal. How a dæmon acquires a name is not explained in the books, but clarified by Philip Pullman as being normally given by the parents' dæmons. As Will Parry came from our world, his dæmon was not given a name in this way and was named Kirjava (meaning mottled in Finnish) by Serafina Pekkala when she first met the dæmon. Author: Dr Sarah Hill, Dermatology Registrar, Dept of Dermatology Greenlane Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, 2005. What is a collodion baby? Collodion baby is the name given to a baby who is born encased in a skin that resembles a yellow, tight and shiny film or dried collodion (sausage skin). These babies are often premature. It is due to mutation of certain genes and is usually an autosomal recessive, congenital ichthyosis (scaly skin condition). However, 10% of collodion babies have normal underlying skin – a mild presentation known as ‘self-healing’ collodion baby. What are the complications of the collodion membrane? What is the management of a collodion baby? The baby is usually transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). An incubator provides a humidified, neutral temperature environment. The life expectancy and difficulties that the collodion baby faces depend upon the particular underlying condition. What Is Bartholin's Gland Cyst? Treatment involves surgically removing or marsupializing the cyst. A catheter can be inserted to drain the abscess or marsupialization may be done initially to treat the abscess or later to prevent the cyst from refilling. Marsupials are arranged by size, with the largest at the top.\n\n"

The song can be traced only as far as the early nineteenth century, but the lyrics reflect an association between holly and Christmas dating at least as far as medieval times. The version which is now popular was collected in 1909 by the English folk song collector Cecil Sharp in the market town of Chipping Campden in Gloucestershire, England, from a woman named Mary Clayton. \"This Christmas\" is a song by American soul musician Donny Hathaway released in 1970 by Atco Records. The song gained renewed popularity when it was included in 1991 on Atco Records' revised edition of their 1968 Soul Christmas compilation album and has since become a modern Christmas standard, with the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers reporting that it was the 30th most-performed holiday song of all time. Phil Upchurch said the song was \"absolutely the premiere holiday song written by an African American\".\n\n"

From the Chinese side, the bridge is accessible for tourists who can walk up to a line close to the actual border. It connects the cities of Dandong in China and Sinuiju of North Korea, by railway and roadway but pedestrians are not allowed to cross between either side. The bridge was constructed by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) between April 1937 and May 1943 during its occupation of Korea and its puppet state of Manchukuo (now northeast China). Further downstream, construction work on the New Yalu River Bridge began in October 2010. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay. As such, control of the Ordos remained extremely important for the rulers of China: not only for potential influence over the steppe, but also for \n\n The following maps, made by Korea from the 18th century to the 19th century, show Sino-Korean borders to be aligned along the Yalu and Tumen Rivers, essentially the same as those today (between China and North Korea): However there is an exception in the last map, as it shows the border visibly protruding north of the Tumen River.

From the Chinese side, the bridge is accessible for tourists who can walk up to a line close to the actual border. It connects the cities of Dandong in China and Sinuiju of North Korea, by railway and roadway but pedestrians are not allowed to cross between either side. The bridge was constructed by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) between April 1937 and May 1943 during its occupation of Korea and its puppet state of Manchukuo (now northeast China). Further downstream, construction work on the New Yalu River Bridge began in October 2010. The lands south of the Yellow River—the Hetao, the Ordos Desert, and the Loess Plateau—provided no natural barriers on the approach to the Wei River valley, the oft-called cradle of Chinese civilization where the ancient capital Xi'an lay.

The fifth (outermost) metatarsal is much shorter and broader, acquiring a \"hooked\" shape. Claw Toe is a result of the flexor digitorum brevis (attached to the middle bone, also called the middle phalanx) contracting and eventually overpowering all of the toe muscles. Consequently, the joint flanked by the middle phalanges and the proximal clasp upward. A foot claw toe causes the foot to rub against the inside of the shoes, leading to calluses. Worse, because the metatarsal heads are forced to support the weight, open sores (also called foot ulcer) may develop on the soles of the feet. The earlier claw toes are treated, the easier they can be straightened. What are the Symptoms of Claw Toes? The toes of people with foot claw toe bend upward from the foot’s ball joints, and sometimes downward to the sole at the middle joints. Foot Ccrns usually also appear either under the ball or on the top of the toe. Claw toe deformity is usually caused by muscle imbalances in the foot. People with flat feet (a condition also called pes planus), people who have suffered traumatic foot injuries, and people with underlying diseases are more prone to claw toes. How to diagnose claw toe deformity? Because a clawtoe is very evident, a physical examination is sometimes all the physician needs to diagnose it. Most doctors also measure the foot’s stability and flexibility, and look for signs of abnormal sensation in the toe during the examination. In some cases, doctors require patients to undergo foot X-rays to accurately determine toe position and also to spot any bone inflammations, arthritis, or joint lining inflammation. What treatment options are available for claw toe? When detected early, claw toes can be straightened without surgery. The proximal phalanx head is then trimmed, letting the toe straighten. Some also suffer from toe numbness. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal's \"hands\" and \"feet\" correspond only to what would be the bones of the human finger or toe. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs.

A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable. A modern use in this manner includes tying the obi (or belt) of a martial arts keikogi. With both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie shoelaces, whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short. It is appropriate for tying plastic garbage or trash bags, as the knot forms a handle when tied in two twisted edges of the bag. The reef knot figures prominently in Scouting \n\nTelomeres are caps that protect the ends of your chromosomes, in much the same way as the plastic tips of your shoelaces keep them from fraying.When scientists talk about inflamm-aging, they're referring to the shortening of telomeres, which is caused by inflammation.Even excess weight can be part of the inflammation response, both by aggravating it and by serving as a response to inflammation.Antioxidants, including vitamin C and many phytochemicals, help prevent oxidation of cholesterol. Bolt snaps are made of plastic or metal. The metal used is stainless steel or brass for diving and boating applications, with a stainless steel spring.

        "context": " An aglet is a permanent ending applied mechanically to bind the end of the rope. A typical example is the plastic aglet at the end of a shoelace. Metal aglets may be crimped onto ropes or cables. Aglets may also be made by melting a softer metal to cap the end of the cable. A modern use in this manner includes tying the obi (or belt) of a martial arts keikogi. With both ends tucked (slipped) it becomes a good way to tie shoelaces, whilst the non-slipped version is useful for shoelaces that are excessively short. It is appropriate for tying plastic garbage or trash bags, as the knot forms a handle when tied in two twisted edges of the bag. The reef knot figures prominently in Scouting \n\nTelomeres are caps that protect the ends of your chromosomes, in much the same way as the plastic tips of your shoelaces keep them from fraying.When scientists talk about inflamm-aging, they're referring to the shortening of telomeres, which is caused by inflammation.Even excess weight can be part of the inflammation response, both by aggravating it and by serving as a response to inflammation.Antioxidants, including vitamin C and many phytochemicals, help prevent oxidation of cholesterol. Bolt snaps are made of plastic or metal. The metal used is stainless steel or brass for diving and boating applications, with a stainless steel spring. Chrome plated zinc and plastic bodies are only suitable for light loads such as key rings, handbag straps, and leads for small dogs. The swivel fitting is usually a ring, but can also be a swivel shackle body.

Five Rivers Medical Center is proud to announce a new service for individuals with swallowing difficulties called Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES). Until now, individuals have had to drive to Walnut Ridge or Jonesboro for a swallowing evaluation. FEES is a comprehensive assessment of swallowing via use of an endoscope. -Observation of the anatomy involved in the oropharyngeal (area where nasal passages connect to mouth/throat) stage of swallowing via endoscope. -Response to therapeutic maneuvers and interventions to improve the swallow. (In the process of this evaluation, if observations of swallowing structures or functions suggest the possibility of an undiagnosed medical condition, your referring physician will be notified. A small tube will be gently inserted through your nose into your throat. Individuals that may develop problems with swallowing usually have progressive muscular or neurological diseases like Parkinson’s disease, which affects the muscles used in swallowing. Individuals who have had a stroke may have problems swallowing and can actually have the food enter into the lungs instead of the esophagus due to muscle weakness, which can lead to more medical complications like aspiration pneumonia. Five Rivers Speech Therapy Services also specializes in the treatment of swallowing dysfunction and use Vital-Stim to strengthen the muscles used for swallowing. So you can not only use Five Rivers Medical Center for your diagnostic evaluation of swallowing, but also for treatment of the problem by our speech therapists at our out-patient facility. If you would like more information, or would like to set-up a swallowing or speech therapy evaluation, please call Five Rivers Medical Center Therapy Services at 870-892-6009— or stop by our clinic at 301 Country Club Road. “ Ashlyn Shipley SLP and Jennifer Daffron SLP would be more than happy to assist you with any Speech Therapy needs. After completing your basic training, you will need to pursue a postgraduate degree in occupational health or medicine. This postgraduate degree focuses specifically on occupational health and equips you with the necessary knowledge and skills in this field. Once you have obtained your postgraduate degree, the next step is to undergo specialty training in occupational medicine. During this period, you will gain specialized knowledge and experience in occupational medicine through a combination of practical work, rotations, and further study. After completing this extensive training and meeting the requirements set by the faculty, you will be recognized as a qualified occupational physician with the designation FAFOEM (Fellow of the Australasian Faculty of Occupational and Environmental Medicine). As an occupational physician, your role will encompass various aspects of occupational health, including performing Independent Medical Examinations (IMEs), Fitness for Duty assessments, workplace assessments, as well as primary care of work-related injuries. Your specialized knowledge will make you well-versed in dealing with workers' compensation matters, insurance company matters, and the health needs of both large and small companies in various industries.
