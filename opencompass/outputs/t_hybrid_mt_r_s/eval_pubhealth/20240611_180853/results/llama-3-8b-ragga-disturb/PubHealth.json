The recently emerged novel coronavirus pneumonia, named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), shares several clinical characteristics with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and spread rapidly throughout China in December of 2019 (Huang et al., 2020). The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020). Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19. In order to determine whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to newborns through breastfeeding, we measured viral RNA in the patient's breastmilk samples at different time points after delivery.

A second phase III trial in gastric cancer called RAINBOW has just completed enrolment and is comparing ramucirumab in combination with paclitaxel to paclitaxel given on its own. The company was forced to discontinue schizophrenia candidate pomaglumetad methionil in August, while Alzheimer's candidate solanezumab missed its targets in two phase III trials, although it remains in testing as an early-stage intervention. early and late drug discovery. Medicines Control Council blocked further human trials. The Tanzania health agency, NIMR, also rejected proposals for human trials, but the Vissers approached the Tanzanian Defence Force directly and conducted the trials in military hospitals. A lack of complete results leads to intensified FDA scrutiny of the particular study drug, as well as the pharmaceutical company sponsoring the clinical research study. Different formulations of existing drugs and several new medications for the treatment of schizophrenia and mood disorders are in the pipeline and could be available for patients soon. New drugs in development target several receptors, rather than just dopamine and serotonin, as with current antipsychotics. In the case of formulations, the newer versions have advantages such as a more convenient dosing schedule, which can improve patient adherence. A new, long-acting injectable formulation of aripiprazole (Abilify, Alkermes) is being developed for the treatment of schizophrenia.1,2 Called aripiprazole lauroxil, the drug differs from the long-acting preparation currently marketed by Otsuka and Lundbeck in that it will be available in a ready-to-use, prefilled syringe. Both one-month and two-month formulations are being studied. Another long-acting injectable for schizophrenia, a three-month formulation of paliperidone palmitate (Invega, Janssen), is also in development. Researchers enrolled 509 patients, who were first treated and stabilized with the FDA-approved one-month formulation of the drug (Invega Sustenna), and randomly assigned them to treatment with the investigational three-month formulation or placebo. A NDA for the drug’s schizophrenia and manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder indications was submitted to the FDA in November 20125, but was not initially approved.6 However, the application is expected to be re-reviewed. There were two promising candidates in phase 3 trials that homed in on glutamate receptors for the treatment of schizophrenia — pomaglumetad methionil (Eli Lilly)9 and bitopertin (Roche).10 Unfortunately, both candidates failed in late stage trials and development has been stopped. Still in the running, though, is encenicline (Forum Pharmaceuticals, formerly EnVivo Pharmaceuticals), an alpha-7 nicotinic receptor co-agonist that is being studied as an adjunctive procognitive treatment for patients with schizophrenia, who are receiving chronic stable atypical antipsychotic therapy.

Vaccination is particularly important for people at high risk for flu-related complications, especially the elderly, infants and young children, those with chronic underlying heart and lung disease, and the obese.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt apologies for failure to invite 450,000 women for routine checks. Read more – BBC. Standing on the Shoulders of Stem Cell Gene Therapists: History, Hyperbole, and Hope for the Future. A new type of medicine approved in Europe at the end of May represents the culmination of the successful convergence of two fields of science: stem cell transplantation and gene therapy. Strimvelis, a patient-specific gene-modified stem cell medicine for ADA-SCID (adenosine deaminase deficiency leading to severe combined immunodeficiency; a fatal immunometabolic disorder similar to the bubble-boy disease), was developed by scientists at the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (TIGET) in Milan, Italy, which then later partnered with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Brentford, UK). The journey took more than 25 years of dedicated work by many groups and involved a pivotal trial with 12 children and their brave families. the USA. Using the patient's own stem cells with genetic correction \n\nThe initial findings of a new gene therapy for boys with \"bubble boy\" disease, also known as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID-X1), are promising. A collaborative research team conducted an international clinical trial and reported that the gene therapy appears to be effective and safe. Out of nine boys recruited into the trial, eight are alive between 12 and 38 months after treatment, and none of them have experienced the infections associated with the disease. The gene therapy alone has successfully generated functioning immune systems in seven out of eight boys. Previous gene therapy trials in Europe more than a decade ago had shown that around a quarter of boys with SCID-X1 developed leukemia after treatment. This outcome, along with other factors, slowed down clinical progress in gene therapy for many years. Overall, the initial findings of this new gene therapy for boys with \"bubble boy\" disease are encouraging, with effective immune system function observed in most patients and a potential reduction in the occurrence of treatment-related leukemia. LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s first life-saving gene therapy for children, developed by Italian scientists and GlaxoSmithKline, has been recommended for approval in Europe, boosting the pioneering technology to fix faulty genes. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday it had endorsed the therapy, called Strimvelis, for a tiny number of children with ADA Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (ADA-SCID) for whom no matching bone marrow donor is available. Around 15 children a year are born in Europe with the ultra-rare genetic disorder, which leaves them unable to make a type of white blood cell. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has yet to approve any gene therapies but a growing number of U.S. biotech companies, such as Bluebird Bio, have products in development. Research into gene therapy goes back a quarter of a century but the field has experienced many setbacks, including the high-profile death of an American patient in 1999 and some disastrous clinical trial results in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Now, though, optimism is building, helped by the discovery of better ways to carry replacement genes into cells. Martin Andrews, head of GlaxoSmithKline’s rare diseases unit, believes the technology is proving itself, although it remains at an early stage of development. Trickiest of all may be pricing, given the tiny market for a therapy like Strimvelis. GSK has several other gene therapies under development with researchers at Fondazione Telethon and Ospedale San Raffaele in Italy, including treatments for metachromatic leukodystrophy and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome that could be submitted for regulatory approval in the next couple of years.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States reported a nationwide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping in September 2019. The cases of lung injury associated with vaping date back to at least April 2019. As of now, the CDC has reported 2,758 cases of VAPI with 64 confirmed deaths. All reported cases of VAPI to the CDC have involved individuals with a history of using e-cigarettes, ciga-likes, or vape mods. Many patients also reported using THC-containing products. The outbreak of VAPI peaked in September 2019 and has been steadily declining since then. However, it is important to mention that the COVID-19 pandemic, which surpassed 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, raises the possibility of shared vaping devices contributing to COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, several organizations, including Purdue University and Public Health England (PHE), strongly advise against sharing vaping devices. The CDC has identified vitamin E acetate, a cutting agent often used in THC-containing products, as strongly implicated in VAPI. It is important to note that the information provided here is not exhaustive, and healthcare professionals should rely on up-to-date guidelines and research to diagnose and treat patients with VAPI. Please seek medical attention if you experience any symptoms associated with VAPI or have concerns about your health. Vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI) also known as vaping-associated lung injury (VALI) or e-cigarette, or vaping, product use associated lung injury (E/VALI), is an umbrella term, used to describe lung diseases associated with the use of vaping products that can be severe and life-threatening. Starting, in September 2019, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported on a nation-wide outbreak of severe lung disease linked to vaping, or the process of inhaling aerosolized substances with battery-operated electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), ciga-likes, or vape mods. The cases of lung injury date back to at least April 2019. , 2,758 cases of VAPI have been reported to the CDC, with 64 confirmed deaths. All CDC-reported cases of VAPI involved a history of using e-cigarette, or vaping, products, with most samples having tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by the US FDA and most patients reporting a history of using a THC-containing product. In late February 2020, a CDC-authored article in the NEJM stated that the VAPI outbreak was \"driven by the use of THC-containing products from informal and illicit sources.\" However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, that exceeded 1 million worldwide deaths in October 2020, it is now possible that shared vaping devices spread COVID-19. Several organizations, including the Purdue University, and Public Health England (PHE) strongly advises against sharing vapes. The CDC has stated that the THC cutting agent vitamin E acetate is very strongly implicated in VAPI, but evidence was not sufficient to rule out a contribution from other chemicals of concern to VAPI as of January 2020. Possible sources of VAPI include:\n E-liquid vaporizers\n Metals: A 2020 systematic review found aluminum, antimony, arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, selenium, tin, and zinc, possibly due to coil contact. However, the carcinogen formaldehyde is known as an impurity found in propylene glycol and glycerol vapor degradation. The CDC states that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in VAPI, having been found in 29 out of 29 lung biopsies tested from ten different states, but evidence is not yet sufficient to rule out contribution of other chemicals of concern to VAPI. Flavoring: Flavoring are often added to e-liquids as well as dry smoke blends. There are currently over 7,700 e-liquid flavors available, most have not been laboratory tested for toxicity. Psychoactive substances:\n Synthetic cannabinoids: Can cause pneumonia. Heat: In addition to vaping, some individuals have also experienced VAPI through \"dabbing.\" It is a process that entails superheating and inhaling particles into the lungs that contain THC and other types of cannabidiol plant materials. Mechanism \n\nVaping refers to the practice of inhaling an aerosol from an electronic cigarette device, which works by heating a liquid that can contain various substances, including nicotine, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), flavoring, and additives (e.g. The long-term health impacts of vaping are unknown. Most individuals treated for VAPI report vaping the cannabis compounds THC and/or cannabidiol (CBD), and some also report vaping nicotine products. </ref> As small but consistent minority of EVALI patients have been found to not be users of THC products. VAPI appears to be a general term for various causes of acute lung damage due to vaping. As of October 2019, VAPI was considered a diagnosis of exclusion because no specific tests or markers existed for its diagnosis. All healthcare providers evaluating patients for VAPI were urged to consider obtaining a thorough patient history, including symptoms and recent use of e-cigarette, or vaping, products, along with substances used, duration and frequency of use, and method of use. The CDC surveillance case definition for confirmed cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing during the 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Absence of pulmonary infection on initial work-up. The CDC surveillance case definition for probable cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use:\n Using an e-cigarette (\"vaping\") or dabbing in 90 days before symptom onset AND\n Pulmonary infiltrate, such as opacities on plain film chest radiograph or ground-glass opacities on chest computed tomography AND\n Infection identified via culture or polymerase chain reaction, but clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process OR minimum criteria to rule out pulmonary infection not met (testing not performed) and clinical team believes this is not the sole cause of the underlying respiratory disease process and\n No evidence in medical record of alternative plausible diagnoses (e.g., cardiac, rheumatologic, or neoplastic process). Other commonly documented hospital diagnoses for cases of severe pulmonary disease associated with e-cigarette use have included acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, and pneumonitis. As of September 2019, distinctions were still being made between processes occurring in association with vaping or the use of nicotine-containing liquids and those considered as alternative diagnoses to VAPI. Initial management involves deciding whether to admit a patient with possible VAPI to the hospital. Currently, the CDC recommends that patients with suspected VAPI should be admitted if they have decreased O saturation (<95%) on room air, are in respiratory distress, or have comorbidities that compromise pulmonary reserve. CDC says patients should be advised to discontinue the use of vaping products upon hospital admission and during outpatient follow-up, to speed recovery and avoid potential recurrence of symptoms or lung injury. An important part of both inpatient and follow-up care for VAPI involves advising patients to discontinue use of e-cigarette or vaping products. Public health recommendations \nThe CDC and the FDA recommend that people not use e-cigarettes or other vaping products that contain THC, particularly products purchased off the street or obtained from informal sources like friends, family, or online sellers. In addition, CDC recommends that individuals not modify or add any substances to e-cigarettes or other vaping products that are not intended by the manufacturer. Avoiding e-cigarettes entirely avoids the risk of VAPI as well as other negative health consequences of vaping, but some health advocates promote e-cigarettes for certain populations as a means to help smokers of conventional cigarettes to quit. Epidemiology \n\nThe outbreak of vaping-related lung injuries in 2019 and 2020 mainly affected young people, primarily in the United States. , there have been 2,758 cases of VAPI reported from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands. Of the 2,051 cases reported to the CDC, information on substance use is known for 867 cases in the three months prior to symptom onset as of October 15, 2019. About 86% reported using THC-containing products; 34% reported exclusive use of THC-containing products. About 64% reported using nicotine-containing products; 11% reported exclusive use of nicotine-containing products. On September 28, 2019, the first case of vaping-associated pulmonary injury was identified in Canada. In September 2019, a US Insurance Journal article stated that at least 15 incidents of vaping related illnesses have been reported worldwide prior to 2019, occurring from Guam to Japan to the UK to the US. 12 cases of health problems with nicotine-containing e-cigarettes were reported to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), with at least one case bearing high similarities to the lipid pneumonia cases reported in the US. Medical officials in continental Europe have reported two cases serious medical problems related to vaping products, one early case related to e-cigarettes documented in Northern Spain in 2015 and a second in Belgium in 2019. Since many of the cases in North America were traced to THC cartridges as well as the use of e-cigarette vape products, but THC remains illegal in European countries, the disease burden related to vaping has been significantly lower in Europe despite the prevalence of e-cigarette use. 18 year-old Raphaël Pauwaert from Brussels died on November 6, 2019, after developing pneumonia and being placed in a medically induced coma because he was unable to breathe on his own. He received an e-cigarette as a gift for his 18th birthday. His doctor stated Pauwaert's fatal lung infection probably resulted from the CBD vapor. This was considered the first death tied to vaping in Belgium. A friend of Pauwaert's was also hospitalized with the identical symptoms after using the same type of e-cigarette, but he survived. The first case of a vaping-related lung illness in the Philippines was reported in November 2019. A 16-year-old girl from central Philippines was vaping e-cigarettes for half a year. She was discharged after she received treatment from a pediatric pulmonologist.

How Can You Mend a Broken Heart - with Stem Cells! With a nod to the Bee Gees - Scientists from the University of Utah School of Medicine have successfully treated heart failure patients with autologous stem cells. The study also determined that mesenchymal stem cell treatment was more effective than treatments utilizing bone marrow mononuclear cells. Researchers at Nagoya University have used stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) to treat neonatal mice with hypoxic-ischemic brain injuries. At this year’s American Heart Association Scientific Sessions, abstracts reporting on clinical trials involving the use of stem cells to treat various types of heart disease, such as Acute Myocardial Infarction and Ischemic Cardiomyopathy, were presented. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety and effectiveness of injecting bone marrow stem cells into heart muscle in an attempt to promote blood vessel growth that could potentially improve the blood supply in hearts that are failing. What these studies show is that the human heart contains stem cells that could potentially be induced into regenerating the heart when needed, rather than just being used to replace expended cells. Regardless, further research has been conducted that supports the potential for human cardiac regeneration. It was demonstrated in mice that there is a resident population of stem cells or cardiac progenitors in the adult heart – this population of stem cells was \n\nNanobots that patrol our bodies, killer immune cells hunting and destroying cancer cells, biological scissors that cut out defective genes: these are just some of technologies that Cambridge researchers are developing which are set to revolutionise medicine in the future. Sanjay Sinha wants to mend these hearts so that they work again. Scientists have shown how the precursors of egg and sperm cells – the cells that are key to the preservation of a species – arise in the early embryo by studying pig embryos alongside human stem cells. Scientists at the University of Cambridge have succeeded in growing miniature functional models of the lining of the womb (uterus) in culture. These organoids, as they are known, could provide new insights into the early stages of pregnancy and conditions such as endometriosis, a painful condition that affects as many as two million women in the UK. Scientists at the University of Cambridge and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute have created a new technique that simplifies the production of human brain and muscle cells - allowing millions of functional cells to be generated in just a few days. Scientists at the University of Cambridge have managed to create a structure resembling a mouse embryo in culture, using two types of stem cells – the body’s ‘master cells’ – and a 3D scaffold on which they can grow. They have tremendous potential to improve human health, potentially leading to treatments for diabetes, cancers, heart and blood diseases, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Healthy Interactions for Diabetes Achieves Sustained Positive 4-year. – According to the study, the associations between Healthy Interactions’ program participation and post-program laboratory test results (HbA1c, glucose and LDL), and healthcare utilization (frequency of. with your diabetes management plan, and you'll likely see a positive. If a woman tests positive during this screening test, the second test, called the Glucose Tolerance Test, may be performed. In its early stages, diabetes is almost symptomless. So the best way to detect the disease is through a blood test. Pattern B and coronary heart disease is stronger than the correspondence between the LDL number measured in the standard lipid profile test. Tests to measure these LDL subtype patterns have been more expensive and not widely available, so the common lipid profile test is used more often. There has also been noted a correspondence between higher triglyceride levels and higher levels of smaller, denser LDL particles and alternately lower triglyceride levels and higher levels of the larger, less dense (\"buoyant\") LDL. Debate continues that it is \"...unclear whether LDL particle size measurements add value to measurement of LDL-particle concentration\", though outcomes have always tracked LDL particle, not LDL-C, concentrations. These observations suggest that lower LDL-C is sufficient to provide protection against CHD.The study design is akin to a prospective randomized clinical trial in that randomization for each individual occurs at the moment of conception—genotypes of DNA variants are randomly \"assigned\" to gametes during meiosis, a process that should be impervious to the typical confounders observed in observational epidemiologic studies. Several mendelian randomization studies have confirmed a causal relationship between LDL-C and CHD. Nonsense variants in the PCSK9 gene that significantly reduce plasma LDL-C concentrations have been associated with a reduced incidence of CHD in a black cohort.24 Similarly, in white subjects a low-frequency missense variant in PCSK9 was found to be associated with lower LDL-C levels, as well as with a lower risk for MI. These observations suggest that lower LDL-C is sufficient to provide protection against CHD.First, an SNP in the endothelial lipase gene (LIPG Asn396Ser) was used as an instrument, and this SNP was tested in 20 studies (20,913 MI cases, 95,407 controls).Second, a genetic score consisting of 14 common SNPs that are exclusively associated with HDL-C was used as an instrument, and this score was tested in up to 12,482 MI cases and 41,331 controls. However, both apo B and measured LDL provide no indication of size and therefore do not suggest a dietary solution to correct the excess of small LDL particles.Other methods, though distant second choices, are to measure apoprotein B (apo B)—since each LDL particle contains one apo B molecule, which therefore serves as a virtual count of LDL particles—or direct LDL measurement.It also ignores variation in LDL particles—size, duration of persistence in the bloodstream, potential for oxidation (since oxidized LDL particles are especially bad), etc. For these reasons, I call LDL cholesterol \"fictitious LDL,\" since it is wildly unreliable. On this lifestyle in which we sharply curtail carbohydrates (which modifies lipoprotein composition), it becomes even more unreliable, essentially invalidating the calculation. We therefore turn to superior methods to quantify LDL particles and measure their size. Small LDL particles—by far the worst (they persist much longer, are more prone to oxidation, and are more adherent to artery walls to form atherosclerotic plaque)—are triggered by consumption of carbohydrates; large LDL particles—more benign—are caused by fats. A typical NMR lipoprotein test result in someone with heart disease risk would be: total LDL particles 1,800 nmol/L (the units signify number of particles per volume) and small LDL particles 900 nmol/L—meaning that 50 percent of all LDL particles are the undesirable, heart disease–causing small variety caused by grain and sugar consumption, reduced with their elimination. Other methods, though distant second choices, are to measure apoprotein B (apo B)—since each LDL particle contains one apo B molecule, which therefore serves as a virtual count of LDL particles—or direct LDL measurement. However, both apo B and measured LDL provide no indication of size and therefore do not suggest a dietary solution to correct the excess of small LDL particles.Stay tuned to Undoctored conversations for clarification of this issue. \"The Composition and Metabolism of Large and Small LDL.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2017, it was discovered that dolphins are the only known wild animal to show signs of this common human disease. As such, these creatures may very well be our first indication of poor environmental conditions, and while it’s still not clear if these blooms directly lead to Alzheimer’s in dolphins or in humans, the researchers say it’s a risk we shouldn’t be willing to take. “The $64,000 question is whether these marine mammals experienced cognitive deficits and disorientation that led to their beaching,” says co-author Paul Alan Cox, an ethnobotanist at the Brain Chemistry Labs in Jackson Hole.

After a two-year follow-up, 1700 cases showed excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases had good recovery, and only 50 cases had poor recovery, resulting in an excellent rate of 97.50%. The study concluded that open reduction surgery is highly effective in treating this type of injury, leading to good shoulder recovery and a low probability of complications. Therefore, open reduction surgery can be considered as the preferred treatment method for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of the humerus in badminton athletes. While the Latarjet procedure can be used for surgical treatment of most cases of shoulder dislocations or subluxation, it is particularly indicated in cases with bone defects. The failure rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair has been shown to dramatically increase from 4% to 67% in patients with significant bone loss. The main long term side effect is reduced external rotation range in the shoulder. In summary, the Latarjet operation may ideally be suited as the shoulder reconstruction procedure of choice for contact athletes, patients with increased shoulder laxity, failed previous shoulder reconstructions or if there is significant bone damage. UC San Diego Health’s Department of Orthopedic Surgery is proud to announce that Christopher Wahl, MD, has accepted the position as chief of Sports Medicine and is now accepting patients at the Perlman Clinic in La Jolla. Wahl is passionate about treating elite and recreational athletes and has earned a stellar reputation for the study of complex, high-energy traumatic sports injuries. A clinical leader, he is one of the nation's most experienced surgeons in the treatment of complex knee ligament injuries and dislocations. His practice also focuses on cartilage restoration and transplantation, repair of the knee and shoulder, shoulder stabilization, rotator cuff pathology and treatment of fractures. For his efforts, Wahl is a nationally recognized surgeon, inspirational teacher and compassionate doctor who has been named repeatedly as a U.S. News &World Report “Top Doctor” in orthopaedics and sports medicine surgery. Wahl says he recognizes that a single medical issue can have many different solutions and that there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to treating injures. Wahl is also an academician who has lectured and published extensively on sports medicine and surgery, including: the anatomic factors predisposing to anterior cruciate ligament tears, the treatment of recurrent shoulder dislocations associated with bone loss and the diagnosis and management of knee dislocations and multiple-ligament knee injuries. In addition, he has developed several innovative surgical techniques for the treatment of cartilage repair, shoulder instability and revision surgery for failed procedures. He completed a sports medicine and shoulder surgery fellowship at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, the top-ranked orthopedic hospital in the United States. In 2011, Wahl was awarded the American Orthopaedic Society Traveling Sports Medicine Fellowship and traveled throughout the countries of South America to visit sports medicine clinics, hospitals and institutes. Objective: The study aims to explore the clinical effect of open reduction surgery for anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus of badminton athletes. Methods: Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Conclusion: Open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect in treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. After the surgery, the patients had good shoulder recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as the preferred treatment method for treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Anterior shoulder dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus, Open reduction, Curative effect. Figure 1: Schematic diagram of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. Due to occupational characteristics and sports characteristics and other factors, incidence of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus among badminton athletes is significantly higher than the normal population. Clinical study found that anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus can affect each other. Among them, open reduction surgery is the most commonly used in clinical treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical comes of open reduction surgery for anterior shoulder dislocation combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. In order to prove clinical treatment effect of this method, the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were selected as the research objects, with following analysis of treatment method, treatment effect and rehabilitation done. Clinical data of 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus admitted in our hospital from June 2012 to June 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. All the patients were badminton athletes. Our clinical staff adopted open reduction surgery for the 2000 patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The main clinical symptoms of the patients were varying degrees of pain, swelling of the shoulder, shoulder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging results showed that the patients had anterior dislocation of the shoulder accompanied by varying degrees of surgical neck fracture of humerus. All patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder and surgical neck fracture of humerus included in this clinical study were treated with open reduction surgery. After anesthesia came into effect, make a 5 cm to 12 cm incision in the anterolateral side of the affected shoulder, and sever the deltoid muscle at the attachment point of acromion and clavicle to fully expose the patient's shoulder (Figure 2). Figure 2: Schematic diagram of shoulder position. Finally, repair the joint capsule and deltoid muscle, prevent and treat drainage tube, and then suture the wound. Two days after the operation, the patient was instructed to have isometric contraction exercise of the shoulder muscles and active stretching exercises of the elbows. One week after the surgery, the clinician should instruct the patient to undergo passive shoulder contraction exercises. Six weeks after the surgery, the patient was instructed to undergo shoulder abduction and flexion exercises. The patient was instructed to perform routine shoulder exercises 12 weeks after the surgery. The stitches were removed from the patient 12 days after the surgery and the shoulder plate was removed from the patient after 1 year of operation. In the clinical research analysis, the clinical treatment effect of patients with joint anterior dislocation combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus is divided into three levels, namely, excellent, good and poor. Excellent: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without pain or tenderness, nor activity disorder; good: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is without tenderness or spontaneous pain, but will have obvious discomfort in case of weather change or overstrain, with limited shoulder joint activity; poor: after the treatment, the patient's shoulder joint is with spontaneous analgesia and activity-limited symptoms . Seen from the follow-up results of the 2000 patients, among the 2000 cases of badminton athletes, 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Of these 2000 patients, 36 patients had complications of humeral head ischemia and necrosis after surgery, only 10 patients had infection complications, and 45 patients had shoulder stiffness complications. 1700 cases have excellent shoulder joint function recovery, 250 cases have good recovery, while the remaining 50 cases have poor recovery, with excellent rate at 97.50%. Clinical studies have shown that anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus will cause very serious shoulder soft tissue injury, so that patients show varying degrees of shoulder joint activity disorder in the daily life and training process. If patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus fail to receive timely treatment, in less serious case, there will be shoulder activity disorder, in severe case, life-long disabilities may be caused, affecting life-long life quality of patients [15-16]. At present, open reduction is the main method for the treatment of anterior dislocation of shoulder combined with fracture of surgical neck of humerus. Seen from the statistical data of this clinical research analysis, treatment of anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus with open reduction surgery enjoys very significant curative effect. After the open reduction surgery, the patients had good shoulder joint recovery, with low probability of complications. Thus, this surgical method can serve as preferred treatment for the patients with anterior dislocation of the shoulder combined with surgical neck fracture of humerus. The long-term treatment effect is better, less postoperative complications. BMC Musculoskelet Disord 2014; 15: 206. J Orthop Trauma 2000; 14: 36-40. Xuhui L.

On its Twitter Handle @WHO on Saturday, the organisation expressed concerned about recent reports on cases of suicide that indicated that someone, somewhere in the world, dies by suicide in every 40 seconds. The global organisation, therefore, urged the public to offer immediate support to persons around them who had previously tried to take their own lives, persons with depression, an alcohol or drug addict. WHO said that those at risk for suicide were individuals with severe emotional distress following the loss of a loved one or a relationship break-up. WHO said that individuals who were considering suicide often threatened to kill themselves or said things such as “no one will miss me when I am gone’’. It said that these individuals also looked for various ways to kill themselves by seeking access to pesticides, firearms, medication or browsed the internet for means of taking their own life. According to WHO, individuals attempting suicide often show it by saying goodbye to close family members and friends, giving away their valued possessions or writing a will. Views on suicide have been influenced by cultural views on existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. Most Western and Asian religions—the Abrahamic religions, Buddhism, Hinduism—consider suicide a dishonorable act; in the West it was regarded as a serious crime and offense against God due to religious belief in the sanctity of life. In the 20th century suicide in the form of self-immolation has been used as a form of protest. When someone commits suicide, they only lose day-consciousness. They then experience the body's rotting. According to Rulof, this pain cannot be compared with any torture on earth. For example, when someone commits suicide at the age of 35, and that person had to become 85 years old, they must dwell in an empty world for 50 years. The book The Cycle of the Soul tells the story of Lantos and what he experiences when he commits suicide. **\n\nWomen are more likely to attempt suicide; men are three times more likely to succeed. **Who dies? **\n\nGlobally, around 1 million people kill themselves each year, equivalent to one person every 40 seconds. ### **What are the chances of survival?

Several states disciplined another physician for promoting the \"Lupron protocol,\" which involved administering high doses of a drug used to chemically castrate sex offenders to autistic children. Chemical castration is castration via anaphrodisiac drugs, whether to reduce libido and sexual activity, to treat cancer, or otherwise. Unlike surgical castration, where the gonads are removed through an incision in the body, chemical castration does not remove organs, nor is it a form of sterilization. Chemical castration is generally considered reversible when treatment is discontinued, although permanent effects in body chemistry can sometimes be seen, as in the case of bone density loss increasing with length of use of DMPA. In May 2016, The New York Times reported that a number of countries use chemical castration on sex offenders, often in return for reduced sentences. Life-threatening side effects are rare, but some users show increases in body fat and reduced bone density, which increase long-term risk of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis, respectively. They may also experience gynecomastia (development of larger-than-normal mammary glands in males); full development is less common unless chemical castration is combined with feminizing oestrogen therapy. These drugs also deflate the breast glands and expand the size of the nipple. Treatment for sex offenders\nThe first use of chemical castration occurred in 1944, when diethylstilbestrol was used with the purpose of lowering men's testosterone. The antipsychotic agent benperidol was sometimes used to diminish sexual urges in people who displayed as then thought inappropriate sexual behavior, and were likewise given by depot injection. But benperidol does not affect testosterone and is therefore not a castration agent. Chemical castration was often seen as an easier alternative to life imprisonment or the death penalty because it allowed the release of the convicted. In 1981, in an experiment by P. Gagne, 48 males with long-standing histories of sexually deviant behaviour were given medroxyprogesterone acetate for as long as 12 months. The research recorded a continuation of this more positive behaviour after the administration of the drug had ended with no evidence of adverse side effects and recommended medroxyprogesterone acetate along with counselling as a successful method of treatment for serial sex offenders. Leuprolide acetate is an LHRH agonist that is most commonly used in chemical castration today. Psychotherapy has also recently been used in conjunction with chemical castration in order to maximize and prolong the beneficial results. Chemical castration therapy reduces an individual's libido which then makes some offenders more responsive to the introduction of psychotherapy. This combination therapy is most often utilized in those who are at a high risk of offending. However, in animal species where females continue their mating behaviour after being spayed, the males also continue to mate after being castrated. So there are scientists who argue that it makes no biological sense to assume that any treatment that emulates castration would remove sex drive in men but not in women. These scientists argue that these observations, along with the fact that humans are animals and subject to evolution, show that it is flawed to think that male sexuality would be treatable by medication if female sexuality is not. Some criminologists argue that the appearance of a lower recidivism rate in male sex offenders who take chemical castration treatment than in those who do not can be explained by factors other than biological effects of the medication. One hypothesis is that men who accept the negative effects of hormonal treatment in exchange for shorter prison sentence are distinct in that they value freedom from incarceration higher than men who rather stay in prison for a longer time than face the side effects of chemical castration. These criminologists also argue that police investigators treating castrated men as less likely to reoffend than non-castrated men may cause an investigation bias and self-fulfilling prophecy, and that men who sell some of their prescribed medicines on the black market for drugs get a hidden income that improve their ability to afford measures to hide recidivism that is not available to men without such prescriptions. United States\nIn 1966, John Money became the first American to employ chemical castration by prescribing medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, the base ingredient now used in DMPA) as a treatment for a patient dealing with pedophilic urges. The drug has thereafter become a mainstay of chemical castration in America. Despite its long history and established use, the drug has never been approved by the FDA for use as a treatment for sexual offenders. Offenders may not reject the intervention, although they may elect surgical castration instead of ongoing DMPA injections. Although, a convicted child sex offender convicted in 2019 and eligible to be castrated chemically, the technical details on how the punishment will be carried out was under debate between the Government and Indonesian Physicians Association, resulting the sentence suspended until the technical details made. The chemical castration punishment carried by specifically appointed physician in central government-run or local government-run hospital, and witnessed by witnesses from Attorney General, Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Ministry of Social Affairs, and Ministry of Health. The drug cyproterone acetate has been commonly used for chemical castration throughout Europe. It resembles the drug MPA used in America. Estonia \nOn June 5, 2012, Estonia passed a law that allows voluntary chemical castration as a part of complex treatment for less serious sex offenders as an alternative of imprisonment. However, the treatment is rarely used in practice. Germany \nIn the 1960s, German physicians used antiandrogens as a treatment for sexual paraphilia. Russia\nIn October 2011, the Russian parliament approved a law that allows a court-requested forensic psychiatrist to prescribe the chemical castration of convicted sex offenders who have harmed children under the age of 14. Turing experienced side effects such as gynecomastia (breast enlargement) and bloating of the physique. New Zealand \nIn New Zealand, the antilibidinal drug cyproterone acetate is sold under the name Androcur. In the case of voluntary statutes, the ability to give informed consent is also an issue; in 1984, the U.S. state of Michigan's court of appeals held that mandating chemical castration as a condition of probation was unlawful on the grounds that the drug medroxyprogesterone acetate had not yet gained acceptance as being safe and reliable and also due to the difficulty of obtaining informed consent under these circumstances. Treatment of cancer\nA major medical use of chemical castration is in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers, such as some prostate cancer, where it has largely replaced the practice of surgical castration. Chemical castration involves the administration of antiandrogen drugs, such as cyproterone acetate, flutamide, or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists.

SSRI antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors, while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with co-morbid inattentiveness or hyperactivity. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Medications may be used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being antidepressants, stimulants, and antipsychotics. The atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are FDA-approved for treating associated aggressive and self-injurious behaviors. However, their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and autistic people may respond atypically. Side effects, for example, may include weight \n\n androgen deprivation therapy, and it should be used if a very quick reduction in testosterone levels is needed. However in recent years, orchiectomy is not commonly used since medical castration is a viable option. Medical castration means that drugs or medications are used to suppress the production of androgens such as testosterone. Some examples of medications used in medical castration include, euprolide, goserelin (Zoladex), buserelin, and triptorelin (Trelstar).\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For Suzanne Somers, Rosie O'Donnell, and Oprah Winfrey, the symptoms of menopause had been cured. Treatment of menopause has undergone several shifts. Initially, the approach seemed obvious: replace estrogen and progesterone. \"It touted the benefits of estrogens as the panacea. Estrogens became the magic bullet that everyone should go on.\" Although replacement hormones worked, they came with a price. Researchers had initially planned to follow women for eight years, but the study was cut short when they noticed a dramatic increase in breast cancer. And it wasn't only breast cancer; replacement hormones also increased the risk of heart disease, strokes, and blood clots. As a consequence, hormone replacement therapy became something doctors began to fear, not embrace. Somers believed that replacement hormones caused heart disease, blood clots, and cancer because they were made by big pharmaceutical companies—they weren't natural. Somers was a convert.I stopped itching, and bitching, and crying, and, best of all, getting fat. \"The effect was immediate.I wanted a natural, effective way to deal with this.... [T]hen I found the solution—a cutting-edge endocrinologist/anti-aging doctor who prescribed a treatment. Instead of Tamoxifen Somers chose Iscador, an alternative remedy made from mistletoe. Breast cancer had brought Suzanne Somers into the world of alternative medicine. But it was menopause that made her a crusader. On the same show, Oprah asked Christiane Northrup, a gynecologist, to explain what had happened. It is usually a five-to-eight-year process, and it begins with the start of irregular periods, usually by age forty-five.\" Somers's description was more entertaining: \"Suddenly the Seven Dwarfs of Menopause arrived at my door without warning: Itchy, Bitchy, Sweaty, Sleepy, Bloated, Forgetful, and All-Dried-Up.\" No doctor seemed to understand this passage [into menopause].... I wanted a natural, effective way to deal with this.... [T]hen I found the solution—a cutting-edge endocrinologist/anti-aging doctor who prescribed a treatment.\" Somers was a convert.She wrote books about it.She told Larry King about it on CNN.She told Rosie O'Donnell, who later talked about it on _The Joy Behar Show_.BEHAR: Are you still in menopause?You used to have hot flashes every day when we were on _The View_.O'DONNELL: Done.Started at 41, ended at 44.\n\n begin to change in men around age 30 and more abruptly in women when they reach menopause, around age 50. Conversely, early surgical menopause has been demonstrated to increase the incidence of these diseases. Research with women and men undertaking HRT has shown that taking sex hormones that are biologically identical to human hormones delays the onset, decreases the incidence of, and can reverse the course of age related illnesses such as heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, and some types of cancer. However, one of the most significant career changes for Suzanne Somers came in the realm of health and wellness. In 2001, after receiving conventional treatment for breast cancer, Somers decided to explore alternative medicine for her post-cancer care. Through her own experiences with breast cancer and menopause, Suzanne Somers became an advocate for alternative medicine. She questioned the conventional approach and sought alternative ways to improve her health and well-being.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The clinical trials could reveal just how good an idea it is to raise patients’ good cholesterol levels. HDL has a good reputation because it transports cholesterol away from the arteries and to the liver, which experts think prevents cholesterol clogs on artery walls. But HDL is just one player in a complex lipoprotein system. Another player is the lipid transfer protein CETP. For example, CETP helps exchange the cholesteryl esters in HDL for the triglycerides in LDL. Studies of animals, as well as people lacking CETP, formed much of the early basis for pursuing CETP inhibitors as drugs (Arterioscler. Biol., DOI: 10.1161/01.ATV.0000054658.91146.64). However, “different studies have concluded different things,” says Columbia University’s Alan R. Tall, a pioneer of HDL and CETP research. Those people all wound up with elevated levels of HDL, which might seem like a good thing automatically, and for the most part, it was. It correlated with high HDL levels and reduced atherosclerosis, the thickened artery walls that result from cholesterol buildup and are a warning sign of cardiovascular trouble. HDL transports cholesterol, which is hydrophobic, through the hydrophilic bloodstream. Shown in this cutaway-view computer model is HDL’s core of cholesteryl esters (yellow) surrounded by a membrane (white with green outer surface) and apolipoprotein A-I (blue). As many as one in five people experience side effects from statin therapy, such as muscle fatigue, he says. For those patients, another cholesterol management strategy would be welcome, he says. In New Mexico and elsewhere, she says, patients tend to have low levels of HDL and high levels of triglycerides, another set of hydrophobic molecules that at high levels have been linked to atherosclerosis but that aren’t easily controllable with statins. “We need another agent that will work safely with statins to raise HDL and lower triglycerides,” she says. In the early- and mid-2000s, many hoped that torcetrapib would be that agent. The small side effect turned out to be the tip of an iceberg, Littman says. He thinks Pfizer should have given greater consideration to backup CETP inhibitor candidates that didn’t increase blood pressure. Commercial reasons and a legitimate medical need for more cholesterol-regulating options also factored into Pfizer’s decision, Litt­man adds. Pfizer “was under pressure, and they took their best shot at the problem,” agrees Tall, who consults for Pfizer, Merck, and Roche. They found several factors linked to an increased risk of death in the study: reduction in potassium levels; increases in sodium and bicarbonate levels; and an increase in aldosterone, a hormone made by the adrenal glands that raises blood pressure. Med., DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa0706628). With preclinical models, Mitchel says, Merck demonstrated that the blood pressure and aldosterone increases seen with torcetrapib were off-target effects and not seen with anacetrapib (Br. Pharmacol., DOI: 10.1038/bjp.2008.229). Merck researchers also delved into the basic biology of CETP and HDL. They determined how anacetrapib, torcetrapib, and Roche’s dalcetrapib inhibit CETP—by promoting formation of a complex between CETP and HDL (J. Lipid Res., DOI: 10.1194/jlr.M007468). And with Tall, Merck determined that the HDL from patients taking anacetrapib had similar or improved function compared with their HDL before receiving the drug (Arterioscler. Biol., DOI: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.110.207142). The company started with a moderately sized 1,600-patient Phase III trial. Among patients taking anacetrapib, DEFINE investigators observed a 39.8% decrease in LDL and a 138.1% increase in HDL. Opin., DOI: 10.1185/03007995.2010.536207). Results from both safety trials emerged last fall. Whether the binding mechanism is the key factor that will benefit patients is still to be determined. “We did a comprehensive characterization of evacetrapib’s safety in Phase I clinical trials,” says Holger Schilske, executive medical director of cardiovascular and endocrine research at Lilly. Last fall, Lilly reported results from a Phase II trial of evacetrapib. Still, they expressed optimism because in the trial evacetrapib boosted HDL by as much as 129% and lowered LDL by as much as 36% (J. The company plans to begin Phase III trials of evacetrapib by the end of 2012. Still other researchers are wondering whether the basic premise of CETP inhibition—raising levels of HDL, or good cholesterol—is even that good an idea. “I remain unconvinced that HDL modification is going to yield results,” Cedars-Sinai’s Kaul says. Clinicians have long prescribed the B-vitamin niacin and a class of amphipathic carboxylic acid drugs called fibrates to patients at risk of heart problems. Among many effects on lipids, these drugs boost HDL levels. But whether the drugs provide long-term health benefits to patients is still not clear. In the Stockholm Ischaemic Heart Disease Secondary Prevention Study, conducted in the 1980s, patients taking niacin and a fibrate had a 36% relative risk reduction in cardiovascular mortality (Acta Med. However, in 2011 the U.S. National Heart, Lung & Blood Institute (NHLBI) stopped the 3,400-person AIM-HIGH study early, after an initial round of data analysis demonstrated that niacin had no benefit on top of statins (N. Engl. Med., DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1107579). Med., DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1001282). Not everyone is convinced the AIM-HIGH and ACCORD trials are the last word on good cholesterol. “I don’t think the door is closed on niacin and fibrates entirely,” says Lee, who has no consulting or financial ties to drugmakers. Drug therapy to raise good cholesterol is in a confusing place today, she says. Merck’s Mitchel notes AIM-HIGH was designed to detect a 25% reduction in heart problem risk at minimum, so if the HDL boost from niacin provided a 10 or 15% risk reduction, it could well go undetected. Studies haven’t conclusively determined whether HDL-raising niacin and fibrates provide benefits on top of statins. An even larger niacin-statin clinical trial than AIM-HIGH, called HPS2-THRIVE, is ongoing. Patients in the trial are receiving a combination of niacin with laropiprant, a molecule designed to cut down on the flushing many patients experience when taking niacin. Even if HPS2-THRIVE provides some clarity on niacin, and even if large clinical trials of CETP inhibitors prove successful, they won’t answer all the outstanding questions about HDL, cautions Kaul, who disclosed a consulting relationship with Roche. Inhibition of this process results in higher HDL levels (the \"good\" cholesterol-containing particle) and reduces LDL levels (the \"bad\" cholesterol). According to Harvard Heart Letter: \"HDL cholesterol is turning out to be a much more complex substance than we once believed. Instead of a single kind of particle, HDL cholesterol is a family of different particles. Although they all contain lipids (fats), cholesterol, and proteins called apolipoproteins, some types are spherical while others are doughnut-shaped.

And is rest really the best treatment? But they agree that another concussion should be avoided – especially soon after the first one. In recent years, most doctors have followed guidelines that say the patient should initially rest. The researchers looked at data collected on 2,400 children and teens – aged five to 18 – who were treated for concussion at emergency departments across Canada. The results showed that kids who engaged in some exercise in the first week following a concussion appeared to do better than those who refrained from all physical activity. Zemek is quick to emphasize that patients should avoid anything that could lead to another concussion. But low-risk, non-impact activities – such as walking, pedalling a stationary bike, or swimming – a few days following the injury may speed up healing by increasing blood flow to the brain. Years ago, he notes, it was fairly common for young and professional athletes to return to play almost immediately after a concussion. So, most experts say that people need to rest after a concussion, providing the brain time to recover. And they are continuing to have symptoms, not seeing any progress.\" With most other injuries, Zemek points out, attempts are made to get people to resume some level of activity as soon as possible. \"The faster patients are moving, the better they recover.\" In a similar fashion, he believes \"some sort of early physically-active rehabilitation may be part of the future management of concussions.\" Last month, in the British Journal of Sport Medicine, a group of concussion specialists published a consensus statement that suggests prolonged rest may in fact be harmful. Zemek hopes to determine the ideal type and duration of physical activity with the launch of a new study, in which concussion patients are randomly selected to do either early exercises or rest. Of course, every patient is different and early exercise might not be appropriate for everyone. They are fatigued, they are dizzy and they don't have the stamina. \"They should be referred to a qualified concussion specialist,\" Zemek says.

Because the match was pre-taped, it was not aired to fans during the October 7 broadcast and has never been shown to the public. However, the footage of him being taken out on a stretcher has been seen in WWE's \"Don't Try This at Home\" public service announcements. Even with intensive medical care, his injury initially left him a quadriplegic with essentially no movement below the neck. Droz has since regained movement in his upper body and arms. Drozdov has repeatedly stated that the incident was an accident and that he holds no animosity towards Brown for his injury, while Brown has said there is no blame on either side for the accident. post-concussion syndrome, and said that given MacArthur's history, it would be too risky to return to play. He also cited research that in-game concussion protocols need to be strictly adhered to, and reiterated the need to evaluate players at the first sign of possible concussion, rather than staying in the game. He recommends a proactive approach to ensure players do not return to play too soon, citing recent studies on the numbers of concussions in minor ice hockey, and specifically at the peewee age level when players are typically exposed to body checking for the first time. He also spoke at the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine (CASEM) conference in August 2018, to address post-concussion syndrome, and methods for diagnosis. Doctors have come up with techniques they say can reduce delirium in the ICU. Randy O'Burke at his son's home in Hendersonville, Tenn. After an overwhelming infection sent O'Burke into five-organ failure, he also developed ICU delirium, perhaps related to heavy sedation. An ICU protocol developed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center found that getting him on his feet sooner was key to speeding his recovery. (This post-ICU condition is separate from memory problems that can arise after heart surgery and general anesthesia in the elderly). When Ely started in the ICU years ago, he realized every doctor made different decisions about basic matters such as how quickly to get a patient off the breathing machine. Dr. E. Wesley Ely at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, has developed a checklist of procedures in the ICU that reduces long-term mental deficits by easing sedation, getting patients up and around earlier and helping them stay oriented to their surroundings. Randy O'Burke, 49, recently experienced the treatment regime after he was rushed to Vanderbilt with five failing organs — his brain, heart, liver, lung and kidneys. \"We got on the plane and I just didn't feel right,\" Randy says. He was rushed to the emergency room closest to his son's house, a half-hour from Nashville. \"Imagine the shock when you go in there and [doctors say] 'Oh, every organ is shutting down.' \"\nO'Burke was diagnosed with sepsis, which is a leading cause of death in hospitals. O'Burke's case was so bad, he ended up on a respirator and kidney dialysis. Why Do ICU Patients Get Delirium? \"He was supposed to be lightly sedated and he was heavily sedated,\" Karen says, \"and that was not a good thing.\" She says when the doctors told her to start calling next of kin, she knew it was time to get him transferred to a hospital better equipped to treat him. That's how he ended up at Vanderbilt. He was off dialysis, the ventilator, and off the drugs that put him into a delirious haze. \"I'm starting to get my faculties about me,\" Randy says. As part of this more rapid recovery trajectory, ICU nurses got him out of bed as soon as possible. An enormous amount of medical care went into O'Burke's recovery. Those are now baked into the checklists that nurses, respiratory therapists and doctors use with every ICU patient they treat at Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt's protocol, when systematically followed, can make a big difference to a lot of patients. \"Apparently, I'm pretty much of a miracle,\" Randy says. His hospital was part of the 15,000-patient study that Ely coordinated. \"We had to get buy-in from the nursing staff. Joanna Stollings, a clinical pharmacist in Vanderbilt's ICU, says when she arrived at the hospital, it was clear what needed to get done, but nobody was responsible for seeing it through. \"And so Wes [Ely] helped me kind of champion this project, to really empower the nurses and respiratory therapists to make sure this happens every day.\" \"So if they're getting better care, surviving more — often with a more intact brain — and not bouncing back to the ICU ... to me that's a win-win.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

If Zika is actually implicated in these microcephaly cases, its presence is only part of the story. ​What’s causing the sharp increase in brain damaged newborns in Brazil? ​One theory that you may have read about in the alternative media is that the microcephaly is linked to pertussis vaccination. Starting in 2014, about ten months before microcephaly hit the headlines, Brazil began an aggressive health campaign to vaccinate every pregnant woman against pertussis, urging women to get the Tdap vaccine. Not only does this vaccine contain a large amount of aluminum, which is a known neurotoxin. The FDA clearly states that injected aluminum has been shown to cause cause central nervous system damage if injected into infants at doses higher than 4 to 5 micrograms [a microgram is one millionth of a gram] per kilogram of weight per day. ​While poisoning the unborn child with aluminum is unconscionable, in the United States we have been vaccinating pregnant women against pertussis since 2013 and have not seen a corresponding spike in severe microcephaly cases, so aluminum in vaccines alone is probably not the culprit. ​I’ve started to wonder if perhaps the aluminum in the Tdap vaccine plus exposure to other environmental toxins—the mercury-based preservative thimerosal (still found in multi-dose flu vaccines in the United States and in vaccines used globally) and/or pesticides—could be causing so much immune system damage that a harmless virus like Zika becomes a trigger for microcephaly and brain damage? ​A group of doctors in Argentina have just publicly announced that they believe the epidemic of microcephaly in Brazil is being caused by exposure to a chemical larvicide, Pyriproxyfen, which was injected in Brazil’s water supply in 2014 to kill mosquito larvae. ​Microcephaly occurs in about 2 - 12 babies out of 10,000 in the Uniited States (source). Severe microcephaly, like that being seen in Brazil, was virtually unheard of until this past December. ​When I was training to be a doctor in the 1980s we saw cases of severe microcephaly, cased by congenital rubella syndrome, CRS. ​There was a catch-up MMR vaccine program in some of the areas of Brazil where they are seeing high numbers of infants with microcephaly (Source in Portuguese). Stop giving the MMR to women of childbearing age: this triple-live-virus vaccine is known to cause microcephaly and may be the real cause of the Brazilian epidemic. But I call on government officials in Brazil and the World Health Organization, as well as independent scientists, health researchers, and concerned doctors, to investigate whether three vaccines—MMR, Tdap, influenza—given just before or during pregnancy (especially in the first trimester when the developing fetus is most vulnerable), in combination with other toxic exposures, are the cause of microcephaly in Brazil. On 1 February 2016, the WHO declared its fourth PHEIC in response to clusters of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome in the Americas, which at the time were suspected to be associated with the ongoing 2015–16 Zika virus epidemic. Later research and evidence bore out these concerns; in April, the WHO stated that \"there is scientific consensus that Zika virus is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain–Barré syndrome.\" Some viral infections thought to induce ADEM include influenza virus, dengue, enterovirus, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella zoster, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis A, coxsackievirus and COVID-19. ; Exposure to vaccines: The only vaccine proven related to ADEM is the Semple form of the rabies vaccine, but hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria, measles, mumps, rubella, pneumococcus, varicella, influenza, Japanese encephalitis, and polio vaccines have all been implicated. Large scale epidemiological studies (e.g., of MMR vaccine or smallpox vaccine) do not show increased risk of ADEM following vaccination. One example would be the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine that was approved \n\n abnormalities in unborn babies, was reported in Brazil. The timing on the microcephaly, the history of rash in more than half of the pregnant mothers, and the ongoing circulation of Zika in urban environments suggested a link between the neurological disorder and the virus.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While the eyes of individuals with CVI are structurally fine, their brains have difficulty distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing the information that comes in through their eyes. Unlike ocular blindness, where there is an issue with the eyes themselves, CVI is a form of deprivation where the person sees what we see but has trouble interpreting it. However, the good news is that CVI can improve with dedicated interventions. Children with CVI may have delayed visual responses and difficulty focusing their attention. Additionally, they may have difficulties with visual-spatial tasks, such as judging distances and navigating their environment. Early intervention and specialized educational strategies are important in addressing CVI. These interventions focus on promoting visual skills, improving visual attention, and providing appropriate environmental adaptations to enhance the child's visual experiences. It is crucial for parents, caregivers, and educators to work closely with professionals specializing in CVI to develop individualized strategies and support for children with this condition. In summary, CVI is a neurological form of blindness where the brain has trouble interpreting visual information, despite the eyes being structurally fine. With the right interventions and support, individuals with CVI can improve their visual abilities and enhance their overall visual experiences. Ocular abnormalities affect around 90% of children. They can present as refractive error, strabismus, cortical visual impairment, and premature retinopathy. No recognizable symptoms until after age 40. ; No environmental toxins have been found to be attributable to the condition. ; The condition is primarily localized to the brain and eyes. ; Optically correctable, but continuous, deterioration of visual acuity due to extensive multifocal microvascular abnormalities and retinal neovascularization leading, ultimately, to a loss of vision. ; Mental confusion, loss of cognitive function, loss of memory, slowing \n\n The Children's Nonverbal Learning Disabilities Scale (C-NLD) is an assessment that screens for the symptoms for nonverbal learning disabilities in children, which can affect a child's visual spatial organization, motor abilities, and social interactions. All questions in the assessment are categorized in three headings: motor skills, visual-spatial skills, and interpersonal skills. The C-NLD is a 15 question measure intended to be filled out by the parent or guardian of the child. The scale contains three sections; the first section is designed to assess motor skills consists of 4 questions, the second section is designed to assess visual-spatial skills consists of 7 questions, and the last section assesses interpersonal skills and consists of 4 questions. About two years ago, Eric Jerpe, a teacher of the visually impaired (TVI), showed me a trick. In this case, to address Cortical Visual Impairment (CVI), the most common form of childhood blindness. CVI is a neurological blindness, sometimes also called Cerebral Visual Impairment. The person's eyes are structurally fine—or the kind of fine that those of us with typical vision problems have. CVI is often the result of a traumatic birth, head injury, or epilepsy, among myriad others—WD suffered a stroke in utero, resulting in cerebral palsy and intractable epilepsy—and the brain has become wired such that it has trouble distinguishing, filtering, and categorizing information coming in through the eyes. \"CVI is really a form of deprivation,\" says Christine Roman-Lantzy, a researcher, educator, and leading authority on CVI. An adult with CVI once explained to Roman-Lantzy that everything looked like the inside of a kaleidoscope. And, unlike ocular blindness—the kind of blindness in the popular imagination—CVI improves with dedicated interventions. Among those in her care were children who spent the day staring at the ceiling lights and whose medical charts read \"eye exam: normal,\" though there was the occasional notation of \"cortical blindness.\" She can still picture the page: \"There was a little sidebar that had these two lists about the difference between ocular and cortical blindness, and I thought, 'I'll be darned. (We develop peripheral vision first; additionally, a hallmark of CVI is that children turn away from objects before reaching for them.) Children stared at lights and ceiling fans; they noticed televisions, but didn't watch them (light and movement are enticing). Based on what she was learning from parents at Project CRIB, Roman-Lantzy developed a checklist that eventually morphed into a stable assessment—the CVI Range—which, after the University of Maryland studied it for reliability and validity, was published in 2007 by the American Foundation for the Blind, where it is the perennial best seller. \"Even when there's a lot of damage to the visual pathways, or the processing centers, other parts of the brain will just re-purpose themselves for vision.\" In this way, teaching to CVI is teaching both vision and cognition. And, while the brain's plasticity lasts into early adulthood, learned behavior is harder to reckon with, and early intervention is a child's best bet for moving through the phases. I belong to the Facebook group for parents of kids with CVI. Parents can spend months or years lobbying for a proper assessment or even just basic services. Children are misdiagnosed as having Autism or ADHD. She offers this comparison: When Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) was identified in the 1970s, an international outcry led to interventions such that it is now medical malpractice if a doctor does not screen an at-risk baby. \"There's no outcry for CVI,\" Roman says. \"And yet and this is the only kind of visual impairment in which progress is not just expected—it happens based on things that we do.\" There is also no mandated assessment or tracking of at-risk babies, though that population grows with each year as more and more babies survive the impossible. It is parents, according to Roman-Lantzy, who are going to force the issue into public consciousness, as happened with Autism. There are several Facebook groups dedicated to CVI, Pinterest boards of toys and room setups, multitudes of blogs by parents.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The flesh-eating bacteria is a member of group A streptococcus, the same bacteria that causes strep throat. Flesh-eating bacteria—also known as necrotizing fasciitis—is a quick-spreading, aggressive infection that can be fatal if not treated promptly. Flesh-eating bacteria most commonly attacks the arms, legs, and abdominal wall. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, group A streptococcus is most commonly to blame for necrotizing fasciitis, causing between 700 and 1,200 cases in the U.S. each year, although the actual number is likely higher. How Common Is Flesh-Eating Bacteria? “Flesh-eating bacterial infections are relatively uncommon, but not so uncommon that they are rare,” says Dr. Amesh Adalja, Senior Scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). That said, those with a strong immune system and good hygiene practices (including proper wound care) are unlikely to become infected with flesh-eating bacteria. Those with weakened immunity (e.g., alcoholics or people with diabetes, kidney or liver disease, or cancer) are at a higher risk of infection. The bacteria most commonly to blame for flesh-eating bacteria is a member of group A streptococcus (GAS). Like any bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis can enter the body through an open wound (e.g., from an injury or surgery). The most common way to spread flesh-eating bacteria is through a break in the skin—through, for example, a bug bite, surgical wound, cut, scrape, or burn. Since symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis may start off mild—mimicking the flu, for instance, with nausea and fever—many don’t seek help right away. Sometimes, the injury through which the bacteria entered is mild, perhaps not even breaking the skin. CAN YOU PREVENT FLESH-EATING BACTERIA? Flesh-eating disease, also known as necrotizing soft tissue infection, can be caused by various bacteria, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), among others. In addition to inhibiting bacterial growth, HBOT can also enhance the effects of antibiotics, boost the body's natural defense mechanisms against flesh-eating bacteria, and help resolve or delay the onset of sepsis, a deadly blood poisoning (source). In summary, some potential causes of flesh-eating disease include various bacteria, including MRSA. ; On November 20, 2018, the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and Health Canada announced that they were investigating a multistate binational outbreak of pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections linked to romaine lettuce. Campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in Europe and in the United States. The European Food Safety Authority reported 246,571 cases in 2018, and estimated approximately nine million cases of human campylobacteriosis per year in the European Union. Campylobacter jejuni is in a genus of bacteria that is among the most \n\nContaminated raw seafood cost a man his forearm, according to a case report. A man in South Korea contracted a dangerous bacterial infection after eating raw seafood, according to a recent case report in the New England Journal of Medicine. The man was infected with Vibrio vulnificus, a bacteria found in some coastal waters. Vibrio vulnificus infections can cause flesh-eating disease and are sometimes fatal. In the US, most people get infected by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Doctors determined that the man (who also had type 2 diabetes, kidney disease, and high blood pressure) was infected with the bacteria Vibrio vulnificus. His skin lesions became necrotic, according to the report, meaning his tissue began to die. This isn't the first time Vibrio vulnificus has made headlines in 2018. In July, a Florida man died after eating raw oysters contaminated with the bacteria. And in August, a New Jersey man became seriously ill after he went crabbing and contracted the same infection. There are about a dozen types of Vibrio bacteria the can make humans sick, and most cause an illness called vibriosis. A full 80% of Vibrio infections happen during this time period, according to the CDC. Vibrio vulnificus is one type of Vibrio bacteria that can make people seriously ill. In the US, most people get infected with Vibrio vulnificus by eating raw or undercooked shellfish, especially oysters, according to the CDC. Some people get infections after wading through storm flood waters. It's important to remember that infections like the South Korean man's are rare. But if you're concerned, there are some ways to reduce the risk of all Vibrio bacteria infections, according to the CDC. If you develop any skin infection, tell a doctor if your skin was exposed to salt or brackish water or raw seafood juices. And, unfortunately for raw bar fans, eating raw or undercooked shellfish is also a risk. Of the 80,000 vibriosis infections in the US every year, 52,000 are likely caused by eating contaminated food, particularly raw seafood, according to the CDC.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Could Cipro and Other Fluoroquinolone Antibiotics Cause Irreversible Tendon Damage? The FDA has updated its warnings for — and recommended limitations on — prescribing a class of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones, citing potentially irreversible side-effects including tendon damage and rupture. The antibiotics you took or are taking for your sinus infection, UTI, skin infection, laser eye surgery…ect [sic]…may have already damaged you. Fluoroquinolone (FQs) antibiotics were first approved by the FDA for marketing in the 1980s. The mechanism by which [Fluoroquinolones or FQs] cause tendon injury is unclear. In other words, the drugs cause damage to, and sometimes kill, tendon cells by overproducing oxygen-containing chemicals, and can also harm a cells vital mitochondrial DNA. Depending on which drug is used and what studies you base your analysis on, tendonitis and tendon rupture are estimated to occur in 0.14 percent to 0.4 percent of cases, though experts agree the true incidence is likely higher due to underreporting. According to multiple studies, these risks are higher in elderly populations, non-obese populations, and especially patients also prescribed glucocorticoid steroids, which are used to treat inflammation, among other things. More generally, fluoroquinolones are tolerated, with typical drug side effects being mild to moderate. Postmarketing surveillance has revealed a variety of relatively rare but serious adverse effects associated with all members of the fluoroquinolone antibacterial class. Among these, tendon problems and exacerbation of the symptoms of the neurological disorder myasthenia gravis are the subject of \"black box\" warnings in the United States. A 2018 EU-wide review of fluoroquinolones concluded that they are associated with serious side effects including tendonitis, tendon rupture, arthralgia, pain in extremities, gait disturbance, neuropathies associated with paraesthesia, depression, \n\n such as pipemidic acid, oxolinic acid, and cinoxacin, which were introduced in the 1970s. These drugs were widely used as a first-line treatment for many infections, including very commons ones such as acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. Reports of serious adverse events began emerging, and the FDA first added a black-box warning to fluoroquinolones in July 2008 for the increased risk of tendinitis and tendon rupture. On 12 May 2016, the FDA issued a drug safety communication advising that fluoroquinolones should be reserved for these conditions only when no other options are available due to potentially permanent, disabling side effects occurring together. The FDA put out another label change in July 2017, strengthening the warnings about potentially disabling adverse effects and limiting use of these drugs to second-line treatments for acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated UTIs. In 2008, the U.S. FDA added black box warnings on all fluoroquinolones, advising of the increased risk of tendon damage. In 2016, the FDA found that systemic use (by mouth or injection) of fluoroquinolones was associated with \"disabling and potentially permanent serious side effects\" involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system, concluding that these side effects generally outweigh the benefits for people with acute sinusitis, acute bronchitis, and uncomplicated urinary tract infections when other treatment options are available.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The role of these viruses in more serious respiratory illnesses resulting in hospitalization is less well defined. During a winter when influenza A infection was prevalent, 100 elderly adults hospitalized because of cardiopulmonary illnesses were evaluated for rhinovirus and coronavirus infection. Patients who tested negative for influenza or respiratory syncytial virus had nasal swab samples tested for rhinovirus, coronavirus OC43, and coronavirus 229E by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and for coronaviruses by serologic testing. Twelve percent of patients had rhinovirus or coronavirus identified (rhinovirus, 4 patients; coronavirus 229E, 4 patients; coronavirus OC43, 3 patients; and mixed rhinovirus/coronavirus 229E infection, 1 patient). All patients had significant underlying diseases. These data suggest that rhinoviruses and coronaviruses may be associated with serious respiratory illnesses in frail older adults.

One such condition is when a patient has a high risk of infection and PCR testing may not be 100% sensitive. There are various ways to screen individuals infected with the novel coronavirus. Both methods need a cumbersome swab to take samples from the cavity between the nose and mouth (nasopharyngeal swab).

Mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds have been particularly controversial. In Texas, for instance, even if previous ultrasounds had indicated severe congenital defects, a woman seeking an abortion was required under a 2012 law to have another ultrasound done, \"administered by her abortion doctor, and [she had to] listen to a state-mandated description of the fetus she was about to abort\", though state-issued guidelines later eliminated the ultrasound requirement if the fetus had an \"irreversible medical condition\". However, in an article critical of the assumptions of those on both sides of the issue, sociologist Tracy Weitz, who opposes mandatory ultrasound, notes that \"the use of trans-vaginal ultrasounds is routine among abortion providers.\" Currently, New York, Illinois, and Maine allow non-physician health professionals, such as physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives, acting within their scope of practice, to \n\n In 2012, Vogel attracted nationwide media attention for a bill she introduced requiring abortion clinics to administer transvaginal ultrasounds, which she described as necessary for fully informed consent.

Israel”s Health Ministry have now opened a special hotline to provide medical advice after it was believed that products made by the defunct company Poly Implant Prostheses could be linked to increased cancer risk. The decision was prompted by the French Government”s announcement that it would foot the bill for 30,000 women with the implants, to have them removed. Theyhave a higher than normal rupture rate – up to five per cent among French women – and have been linked to the death of a French woman from arare form of cancer called anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), and implicated in at least seven other cancer cases. Ithas also emerged many of the implants were missing a protective coatingdesigned to stop them from splitting and prevent any gel that leaked from spreading through the body. About 300,000 PIP implants, which are used in cosmetic surgery to enhance breast size or replace lost breast tissue, were sold worldwide before the company went into administration last year. PIP implant procedures have now been banned in Israel. Up to now, there have been very few reported cases of the removal of ruptured implants in the Middle East, and no reports have circulated about new cases of leakage in recent weeks. Shesaid ‘We are pleased to see that health and regulatory experts from theNetherlands, Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Austria, Denmark, Maltaand Australia have all confirmed no evidence of any increase in incidents of cancer associated with PIP breast implants and no evidence of any disproportionate rupture rates. as a part of the breast reconstruction process or used cosmetically to augment small breasts. An implant consists of a fluid-filled, malleable pouch that is designed to mimic to the look and feel of natural breast tissue when inserted into a pocket created under the skin in a procedure called a mammoplasty. The ensuing scare resulted in the largest product liability settlement in U.S. history and the Chapter-11 bankruptcy of Dow Corning Corporation, one of the makers of the implants. Despite legal settlements in the billions of dollars, the claims against silicone-filled implants remain anecdotal; numerous scientific studies have found no link or only a weak equivocal link between the implants and disease. The use of silicone-filled implants was again approved by the FDA for reconstructive surgery in 1998 and for cosmetic surgery in 2006. In 2010 silicone-filled implants manufactured by the French company Poly Implant Protheses (PIP) were banned after it was discovered that the firm had used industrial-grade, instead of medical-grade, silicone gel. Some countries adopted similar recommendations, while others did not; the implants had not been licensed for use in the United States. A 2012 British report on the PIP implants found that the gel used in them did not constitute a long-term health threat. This study investigated whether breast implants are associated with abnormal ECG recordings. The boss of the French company which distributed the defective breast implants was sentenced to four years in prison for fraud. The committee would help the health secretary in conducting the research, which should include a multi-disciplinary, clinical case-controlled study of women with breast implants, especially those who have had them for more than eight years. And despite reports and conjectures showing adverse health impacts of breast implants, there are still women who consider having breast implants,\" the bill's authors noted. There have been roughly 60 cases of ALCL in women with breast implants worldwide, according to the FDA.

This test is commonly used to detect or evaluate rheumatologic disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma, vasculitis (blood vessel inflammation), and various types of arthritis. One important marker that can be detected by this test is rheumatoid factor (RF), which is found in 70 to 90 percent of people with rheumatoid arthritis. However, it's worth noting that a low level of rheumatoid factor can also be present in individuals without rheumatoid arthritis or with other autoimmune disorders. These antibodies tend to be elevated specifically in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or in patients who are at risk of developing it. Additionally, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is commonly measured in a rheumatoid profile blood test. A higher ESR suggests increased inflammation. While the ESR is not specific to any particular disease, it provides a general indication of the amount of inflammation present in the body. This information, along with a thorough medical evaluation, physical examination, and other diagnostic tests, helps doctors and rheumatologists in the diagnosis and management of rheumatologic conditions. Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis. Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis or may indicate systemic disease. Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity. Blood tests and X-rays of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis. Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected. These might include: rheumatoid factor, antinuclear factor (ANF), extractable nuclear antigen, and specific antibodies. Lab findings: anemia of chronic disease (can also appear in non-systemic types ), neutrophilia, thrombocytosis, elevated acute phase reactants (ESR, CRP, ferritin). Diagnosis is made by clinical examination from an appropriate health professional, and may be supported by other tests such as radiology and blood tests, depending on the type of suspected arthritis. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Blood Tests to Diagnose Arthritis. Your doctor will use several different blood tests to help diagnose you with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other inflammatory conditions. Blood tests are usually fast. They take, or «draw,» blood into several test tubes. Once the rheumatoid factor level reaches a certain range, the patient tests positive for rheumatoid factor. Years ago, doctors used the positive result of rheumatoid factor in a patient’s blood to firmly diagnose them with rheumatoid arthritis. Blood Tests for Rheumatoid Arthritis. nerve damage or rheumatoid arthritis and given Lyrica. I'm happy for the people that have used New Blood Test Predicts Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk. Such a test would substantially increase the early detection of RA and make treatment more effective. This test is done to assert the condition of the joints and not for any diagnosis. Imaging tests can detect a buildup of uric acid crystals around the joints or if there are signs of inflammation Yes. Nine out of ten or 90% of people with RA test positive for ACPA and the test is useful for distinguishing RA from other forms of arthritis. Similar to RF, a patient may test positive for ACPA even before the signs and symptoms of … Rheumatoid arthritis is a serious autoimmune disease that attacks the joints and other body parts. Lab tests aren’t perfect—you can test … Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease that affects the immune system that is designed to protect the body by attacking foreign substances like viruses or bacteria. The normal action of the immune system is affected when the autoimmune disease mistakenly attacks the joints. Medical tests for psoriatic arthritis #5: Rheumatoid factor (RF) Rheumatoid factor is a protein antibody produced by the immune system that attacks healthy tissue. Most people with rheumatoid arthritis or Sjögren syndrome have positive RF tests. The higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. These tests are used to detect specific antibodies, genetic and immune factors, and certain markers (substances that may Rheumatoid arthritis The TMJ is affected in > 17% of adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is usually among the last joints involved. Aug 31, 2009 · This test may be useful for monitoring patients with rheumatoid arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, etc.3 However, this is not diagnostic and may rise in other conditions like infections, malignancy, anaemia and some other diseases. An autoantibody is an antibody that is directed against an organism’s own tissues (like in autoimmune diseases). In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, 4 out of 5 people will have RF detectable in their blood. A blood test that measures citrullinated proteins (CPs) could lead to osteoarthritis (OA) diagnoses years before the physical symptoms manifest in patients, according to a recent study. Blood Test Aids Early Detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis A blood test that measures the levels of a certain protein can be used in conjunction with clinical assessments to assist with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is now available in North America. Learn more about the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by taking the symptoms quiz. This quiz is intended for patients who have been diagnosed with RA. Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis and monitoring of rheumatoid arthritis. Blood tests are frequently used to help in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) but also to assess any potential problems with the various drugs that are used to treat RA. All tests DNA Testing for Rheumatoid Arthritis. This test cannot be ordered as an individual test but only as a part of the list of diseases included in our Genetic Predisposition Test panel. A blood test is used to detect the presence of rheumatoid factor. The blood test is commonly ordered to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. Our objective was to determine the diagnostic performance of a point of care test (POCT) for detection of anti-mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) and rheumatoid factor (RF) in early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with 2 years of disease duration or less. Diagnosing rheumatoid arthritis involves a series of lab tests and a physical evaluation of symptoms. Testing blood for rheumatoid factor is a common way to help diagnose the disease, however some patients may test negative while arthritic symptoms persist. This support surprisingly comes from a study showing that antibiotics were not helpful for treating symptoms of the more common “wear and tear” arthritis (called osteoarthritis)1. Elevated levels can indicate muscle inflammation and other muscle problems. A combination of drugs is the cornerstone of treatment. Blood test that could predict arthritis risk. Rheumatoid Factor (RF) Test : Principle, Procedure, Interpretation and Clinical Significance. The IsolateFibromyalgia test reportedly provides a highly accurate diagnosis that differentiates fibromyalgia from conditions that it mimics or conditions that would be misdiagnosed as fibromyalgia, such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Lyme disease, and lupus. Approximately 88% of people with Ankylosing Spokdylitis test positive for HLA B27. It is important to note that positive HLA B27 results by themselves should not be considered definitive. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (sed rate)—This blood test is used to detect inflammation in the body. Higher sed rates indicate the presence of inflammation and are typical of many forms of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis, and many of the connective tissue diseases. In rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system attacks the synovium. This leads to an inflammatory immune response that causes pain, joint deformity and disability as it progresses (). Test limitations: Eight percent of Caucasians have a positive HLA-B27, while far less than one percent actually develop arthritis. Can a dexa scan detect arthritis . Suggest treatment for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis . In order to facilitate the detection of ACPA in clinical practice, our scientists here at ORGENTEC Diagnostika have used mutated citrullinated vimentin (MCV) to develop a very effective rapid test for point of care testing (POCT) upon suspicion of rheumatoid arthritis. Sensitive Test Enables Early Diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis. It an effective tool for the rapid and precise routine diagnosis of suspected RA and the diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid Arthritis and the Lung. Authored by Dr Colin Tidy, It is usually associated with severe arthritis and high serum levels of rheumatoid factor. Blood tests for evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, including serology. Respiratory function tests, including spirometry. Your doctor will perform physical examination, evaluate your medical history, order some blood tests (i.e. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate or ESR, rheumatoid factor or RF and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide or anti-CCP antibodies) in order to confirm the diagnosis. A test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (CCP), substances made in the blood of children with some forms of JIA. Ancillary tests to detect rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. A special blood test can help identify the presence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-CCP antibodies. Other tests (blood tests, MRI or CT scans) may be performed if there are red flags, or to confirm or exclude the presence other rare conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as a spinal tumor, infection, fracture, or other types of arthritis. The cause of the disease is not known, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disease (an illness that occurs when the body mistakenly detects its own tissue as foreign and attacks itself). A reliable new blood test can test for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) years in advance. With about 1.5 million Americans suffering from the debilitating condition, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), early detection is key. HealthTap: Doctor answers on Symptoms, Diagnosis, Treatment, and More: Dr. Singh on signs of autoimmune diseases with negative blood tests: Routine blood tests do not examine for HIV and may not detect any abnormality due to HIV at two years after exposure. “We have developed a test for measuring the underlying autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis patients that should be used to evaluate new treatment regimens,” says senior author Dr. Gregg Silverman, professor in the Departments of Medicine and Pathology at NYU Langone and co-director of its Musculoskeletal Center of Excellence.

Humira is an immune-suppressing drug that reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation. It has shown promising results in a phase 3 trial, where patients with uveitis who were treated with Humira experienced longer intervals between flare-ups compared to those who received an inactive placebo. However, it is important to note that Humira does carry an increased risk of infections, and patients need to be screened for tuberculosis and multiple sclerosis before taking the drug. WEDNESDAY, Sept. 7, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic eye inflammation known as uveitis may be able to keep the condition at bay with the immune-suppressing drug Humira (adalimumab), a new study finds. The current standard treatment for uveitis is corticosteroids. But this treatment comes with a significant risk of side effects, the researchers said. Humira reduces inflammation by blocking proteins that cause inflammation, Jaffe said. One concern with Humira is an increased chance of infections. For this phase 3 trial, Jaffe and colleagues randomly assigned more than 200 patients with uveitis to Humira or an inactive placebo. Among those taking Humira, the average time to a flare-up with the condition was 24 weeks, compared with 13 weeks for those taking the placebo, the investigators found. According to Dr. Mark Fromer, an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, \"Humira effectively achieved disease control after stopping steroid treatment.\" \"Further investigation into alternative therapies for uveitic disease is necessary to attempt to save the sight of the many patients that suffer from this sight-threatening group of diseases,\" Fromer said. For example, approximately 5% of patients who develop ulcerative colitis will experience episodes of recurrent uveitis; some patients with ulcerative colitis will develop other ocular inflammation such as scleritis or episcleritis. Interestingly, the “activity” of the inflammation in the eye and the inflammation in the gut rarely are concurrent, i.e., the inflammatory bowel disease may be under excellent control, but uveitis may be extremely troublesome, and vice versa, the eye may not have any difficulty at all, while the patient is having major flare-ups of inflammatory bowel disease. In contrast, patients with “irritable bowel syndrome” associated uveitis can often be managed with topical therapy or with sulfasalazine or an oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent without the need of a immunosuppressant/immunomodulatory agent. On the other hand, in patients with \"irritable bowel syndrome\" associated uveitis, topical therapy or oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including sulfasalazine, may be sufficient without the need for immunosuppressant or immunomodulatory agents. Birdshot chorioretinopathy may show resistance to treatment. Immunosuppressant therapy along with oral corticosteroid has been somewhat effective in slowing down the progressive inflammation associated with the disorder, preserving visual integrity as much as possible. Immunosuppressive drugs such as the therapeutic monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin, methotrexate and Adalimumab, sold under the trade name Humira, have proven to be effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via electroretinography, during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Eric Kabambi, WHO Congo spokesman, also said: \"It is in a very remote zone, very forested, so we are a little lucky\". Ebola though considered by relevant health authorities as a major public health issue in sub-Saharan Africa, it took time for it to manifest in West Africa and the early cases were diagnosed as other diseases more common to the area. Ebola, also known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever or Ebola viral disease, is a rare and deadly illness caused by one of the strains of Ebola virus. The virus killed more than 11,000 people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The most recent recorded epidemic was in August 2014 in Boende region, where the disease was brought under control where it started in Lokolia, now in Tshuapa province. In order to prevent the virus from spreading any further, officials must quickly track down, test, isolate and treat any suspected cases. Last week, World Health Organization reported one Ebola-related death and the possibility of two others. \"As this is the eighth epidemic [of Ebola] that we are facing as a nation, we should not be rattled\", the health minister said. During his visit to the Central African Republic in response to the ninth Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Director-General conducted several activities to assess the level of preparedness and support the country's response efforts. He visited the Epidemic Treatment Centre, which will manage Ebola cases if needed, as well as the Ouango Sao river port to observe surveillance activities. Additionally, the Director-General visited the Institut Pasteur in Bangui, which will be responsible for laboratory testing and investigations in case of suspected Ebola cases. In the coming days, several activities are planned, including the training of health workers who will manage Ebola patients and the installation of isolation tents. Furthermore, community mobilization efforts to provide information on Ebola prevention will be scaled-up. Meetings were held with the President of the Central African Republic, the Minister of Health and Population, humanitarian partners, and civil society to discuss the country's public health challenges and explore opportunities for collaboration. It is important to note that the Central African Republic faces significant healthcare challenges, with low life expectancy, low vaccination rates among children, a high prevalence of HIV, and high rates of malaria and diarrheal diseases. Overall, the Director-General's visit aimed to assess and support the Central African Republic's preparedness and response efforts in addressing the ninth Ebola epidemic in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. and International Non-Governmental Organizations have supported the public health response to bring an end to the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). They have made huge efforts to track the Ebola virus, to find out where it moves next in order to prevent transmission of the virus. The first Ebola outbreak was discovered in the DRC in a village near the Ebola River, which gave the virus its name. The 1976 Ebola outbreak was much more contained than the 2014–2016 outbreak. The death \n\nBefore the COVID-19 pandemic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo was dealing with the Kivu Ebola epidemic. However, it is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic brought additional strain to the healthcare system and further complicated the ongoing health crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Reference: The Democratic Republic of the Congo has been battling the Kivu Ebola epidemic since 2018, and this epidemic was still ongoing when the COVID-19 crisis began. (source)\n\nEmergency response teams in the Democratic Republic of the Congo faced several challenges during the Ebola epidemic. The outbreak occurred in areas impacted by armed conflicts, which posed significant safety risks for the teams. This included attacks on Ebola treatment centers, which forced organizations like Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to suspend their activities. Furthermore, the high mortality rate and intense transmission of the Ebola virus added to the complexity of the response efforts. In summary, the challenges faced by emergency response teams in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the Ebola epidemic included poor security conditions, community resistance, geographical barriers, and the high infectiousness of the virus. Overcoming these challenges required a multifaceted approach involving collaboration with local communities, improving security measures, strengthening healthcare infrastructure, and ensuring adherence to strict infection prevention protocols.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.The episode has cast a chill on fetal tissue research in the United States.One institution posted a guard outside a lab where the research was being conducted.Fetal tissue has become harder for scientists to procure.In other countries, the research proceeds apace. Planned Parenthood of Delaware (PPDE) has added prenatal care to its roster of reproductive health services. This new service will directly benefit women with insurance through Medicaid by offering more options for prenatal care and for deliveries at Christiana Care Health System. In addition, PPDE will refer patients with a high risk pregnancy to Christiana Care for prenatal care. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing. and against PPCP's educational outreach program. Planned Parenthood's Director of Community Relations Dr. Douglas Stewart said that the false charge of black genocide was harming the national advancement of blacks. The black congregation of the Bethesda United Presbyterian Church issued a statement saying \n\nPlanned Parenthood is a significant philosophical framework that has played a central role in the development of contraceptive methods, contraceptive counseling, and family planning programs and clinics. It provides comprehensive reproductive health services, including contraception, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, cancer screenings, and prenatal care. Planned Parenthood's goal is to empower individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. It offers a wide range of contraceptive methods, such as birth control pills, intrauterine devices (IUDs), condoms, and implants. These methods help individuals prevent unwanted pregnancies and have greater control over their reproductive choices. Additionally, Planned Parenthood offers contraceptive counseling to educate individuals about the different contraceptive options available to them. Family planning programs, associated with Planned Parenthood, go beyond contraception and include a range of services aimed at promoting healthy pregnancies and optimizing reproductive health. These programs provide preconception care, fertility counseling, and support for those trying to conceive. It is important to note that while Planned Parenthood and contraceptive methods are closely associated, Planned Parenthood also provides a wide range of other reproductive health services.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

By 1930, medical procedures in the US had improved for both childbirth and abortion but not equally, and induced abortion in the first trimester had become safer than childbirth. Abortion may also be performed surgically by hysterotomy or gravid hysterectomy. Hysterotomy and hysterectomy are associated with much higher rates of maternal morbidity and mortality than D&E or induction abortion. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term.

She supports non-federally funded embryonic stem cell research, although she has cast significant anti-abortion votes, including ones to ban late-term abortions. She does not want to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision and by July 2018, Murkowski was one of three Republican senators, along with Shelley Capito and Susan Collins, who publicly supported keeping the Roe v. Wade decision. Murkowski opposes defunding Planned Parenthood. In 2017, she was one of seven Republicans, including Capito and Collins, who voted against a bill to repeal the ACA without a replacement that also would have defunded Planned Parenthood. In 2018, Murkowski joined Collins, voting with a \n\nIn Queensland, women seeking late abortions have access to resources and support provided by healthcare professionals throughout the process. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the jihad. Ultimately their pursuit is the wants and desires of the antichrist. Lahren had previously publicly said she was anti-abortion, in addition to numerous other inconsistencies on other issues. Soon thereafter, Lahren told Playboy that she had always supported abortion rights as a matter of national law but was personally against abortion. While in college, Lahren wrote a feature for the Las Vegas Review-Journal about a classmate who had turned to stripping to support herself. Lahren is in favor of same-sex marriage. In June 2020 she supported Supreme Court justice Neil Gorsuch's vote and majority opinion in the combined cases of Bostock v. Clayton County, Altitude Express Inc. v. Zarda, and R.G.

Since 2005, he has repeatedly referred to physician and abortion doctor George Tiller as \"Tiller the baby killer\" on his Fox News prime time show, claiming that there must be \"a special place in hell\" for him. In May 2009, Tiller was murdered by anti-abortion radical Christian terrorist Scott Roeder. O'Reilly ardently condemns the practice of partial birth abortion.

At Cedars-Sinai, where Kimmel’s wife Molly McNearney delivered the baby, the couple’s doctor performed an echocardiogram on the newborn to confirm that his bluish complexion was the result of a cardiovascular defect. The procedure, a Blalock–Taussig shunt, increases blood flow to the lungs thereby alleviating the patient’s cyanosis, or the blue coloring that often presents as a symptom (most commonly of skin on the face and extremities). Kimmel’s son will have a second open-heart surgery in three to six months, and when he reaches adolescence, will undergo a third and final procedure that doctors expect will be minimally invasive. Each will likely require a cardiopulmonary bypass—which mimics heart and lung function for the duration of surgery, keeping the patient alive. Thanks to the skill and expertise of pediatric cardiologists, working with cutting edge science and medicine developed through animal research, more than 63,000 children have been given a new chance at life with successful heart transplants. Many thousands more, including Kimmel’s son, have been successfully diagnosed and treated thanks to research performed with animal models. Last year we shared the emotional story of Lincoln Seay, an infant who survived open-heart surgery and a heart transplant after he was diagnosed with a rare congenital disorder called heterotaxy syndrome. Like many pediatric cardiologists, Lincoln’s surgeons faced challenges that make their success all the more remarkable: the seven-month-old went into cardiac arrest as they waited for the donor organ needed for his transplant—which necessitated an emergency surgery to compress his heart. This, followed by the transplantation, is especially tough on the tiny body of an infant patient. It’s not easy for family members in the waiting room, either. All over the world, scientists and researchers rely on animal models to discover more about how to detect and treat congenital heart defects—offering infants like Lincoln, and Kimmel’s son, a second chance at life. The innovations in medical devices and surgical techniques that result from this work have enabled healthcare providers to perform magic, one baby’s beating heart at a time. He underwent successful surgery at three days of age. He was acquitted of one felony count of practicing medicine without a license and three misdemeanor counts of battery for inappropriately touching boys. Three years later Zackheim was found in court again, confessing to accepting Medicaid for patients no longer in his clinic, accepting payments before services had been provided or for services never received, billing for therapeutic services when no licensed therapist was on site, billing for more expensive therapy services than provided, and fabricating diagnosis. Zackheim died of a heart attack in November 2009 before his sentence was served. They are clinical settings where same-day surgeries and procedures, such as gastrointestinal endoscopy, are performed. ASCs are cost-effective because they have lower overhead costs compared to hospitals. ASCs also focus on same-day surgeries, allowing patients to undergo procedures and return home on the same day. However, it is important to note that despite the advantages of ASCs, there have been challenges in reimbursement rates. This has caused some gastroenterologists practicing in ASCs to struggle to recover the cost of providing services to Medicare patients. They offer a more affordable and less stressful alternative to hospitals, particularly for same-day surgeries and procedures. first guests Kimmel had when his show returned following his son's birth were cardiac surgeon Mehmet Oz, who explained the condition, and snowboarder Shaun White, who was born with TOF. Kimmel later cited his son's condition in a monologue criticizing a previous guest, Senator Bill Cassidy, who had co-authored a congressional healthcare bill, for not living up to the \"Jimmy Kimmel test\" regarding access for patients with preexisting conditions. The monologue was widely discussed as part of the wider debate about the American healthcare system.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The study investigated the technique of CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, where pulses of energy are applied directly to nerve roots near the spine under CT guidance. This stimulation of the nerves helps reduce inflammation significantly and subsequently provides pain relief. The study found that patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency treatment experienced a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those who only received steroid injections. Additionally, the patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment reported faster relief of leg pain and a faster rate of perceived recovery. Therefore, this recent study suggests that CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency may be an effective treatment option for lower back pain and sciatica. It offers potential benefits for patients who do not respond well to conservative treatments such as pain medications or corticosteroid injections. For managing low back pain and sciatica, it is not recommended to offer gabapentinoids or antiepileptics as treatments. Additionally, spinal injections should not be offered for managing low back pain. It is important to note that radiofrequency denervation should only be performed after a positive response to a diagnostic medial branch block and imaging should not be required for people with low back pain with specific facet joint pain prior to radiofrequency denervation. In cases of acute and severe sciatica, epidural injections of local anesthetic and steroid may be considered. Surgical interventions such as spinal decompression may be considered for people with sciatica when non-surgical treatments have not improved pain or function and radiological findings are consistent with sciatic symptoms. Low level laser therapy may be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with arthritis. Pulsed electromagnetic field therapy (PEMFT) has tentative evidence supporting improved functioning but no evidence of improved pain in osteoarthritis. Pulsed radiofrequency: short bursts of radio energy applied to decrease nerve pain. Radiofrequency ablation: a procedure that uses energy to destroy nerves and decrease pain. It's important to note that the suitability and effectiveness of these therapies and medications may vary depending on the individual and their specific condition. It's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and to discuss the most appropriate treatment options for your specific needs. A new study by Italian researchers investigated whether the use of pulsed radiofrequency can help relieve lower back pain and sciatica. This is often the source of sciatica back pain, as the pain spreads down the sciatic nerve which branches from the lower back and down the back of each leg. However, there are many patients who do not respond to these conservative treatments. The technique, CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency, involves applying pulses of energy from a probe under CT guidance directly to nerve roots near the spine, which are the portions responsible for sending pain signals. The pulsed radiofrequency causes stimulation of the nerves, reducing inflammation significantly and subsequently resulting in pain relief. After one year, patients who received the CT-guided pulsed radiofrequency saw a greater overall improvement in pain compared to those only received the steroid injections. The results also showed patients who had the pulsed radiofrequency treatment had faster relief of leg pain and faster rate of perceived recovery. These findings show this alternative treatment is significantly superior compared to conservative treatments given to patients suffering from lower back pain due to a herniated disc or sciatica. Pulsed radiofrequency is a fast and effective treatment that does not have the same adverse events associated with it, like the use of pain medications and steroids. This minimally invasive and safe procedure is now being offered to patients suffering from herniated discs and sciatica who are not responding to the typical treatments offered. > Pulsed radiofrequency relieves acute back pain and sciatica.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the US in the 21st century, black people are most likely to be at risk of unintended pregnancy: 84% of black women of reproductive age use birth control, in contrast \n\n A falling birth rate has been identified by some observers as harmful to a race of people; for instance, in 1905 Teddy Roosevelt said that it was \"race suicide\" for white Americans if educated white women continued to have fewer children. In 1934, Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association resolved that birth control constituted black genocide. The combined oral contraceptive pill, popularly known as \"the Pill\", was approved for US markets in 1957 as a medicine, and in 1961 for birth control. Much of the opposition to fertility control was sparked by the sterilization of Minnie Lee and Mary Alice in 1973. A 1971 study found that a majority of black men and women \n\n of Black population control emerged-- forced sterilization. Eugenics programs saw an emergence across the nation to control Black population growth via coerced sterilizations The “Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Male Negro,” known as the “The Tuskegee Syphilis Study,” served to examine the effects of untreated syphilis in men in Macon County, Alabama. During the study treatment for syphilis became available, but the Black male subjects were misled and denied treatment, receiving spinal taps under the guise of treatment. Conducted by the United States Public Health service, the study did not explore the outcomes of syphilis in women, though many of the subjects were married and had families.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Epidemiologist Hiroshi Nishiura expressed concern that the games could help spread more contagious COVID-19 variants, given the fact that a large numbers of athletes, coaches, officials, media, local volunteers, and domestic spectators would participate in the games. A Japanese actress working for the French company Louis Vuitton received a number of coronavirus-related comments on the company's Instagram page, which the company later deleted. As of 17 June, Japan received an estimated 1,700 foreign travellers in May, an all-time low for the second consecutive month, amid the coronavirus pandemic, government data showed Wednesday. It is the eighth consecutive monthly decline, as travel restrictions were imposed globally amid the spread of the virus, according to the preliminary data. Furthermore, Japan's exports and imports in May both posted the largest year-on-year drops in more than 10 years, reflecting rapidly weakened overseas demand as the coronavirus pandemic continued to slow economic activities globally, government data showed Wednesday. On 3 April, Japan expanded its entry ban, effectively barring entrance to the country for visitors from 73 countries and regions.

The scientists utilized a gene-editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 to edit the genomes of human embryos with a specific mutation that causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a form of heart disease. By successfully editing the embryos and removing the genetic mutation, the researchers demonstrated the feasibility of correcting single gene mutations in human embryos outside of China, where similar studies had been conducted previously. If proven safe, this embryo gene correction method has the potential to prevent the transmission of genetic diseases to future generations. This can be done by incorporating desired genes or disrupting specific genes within the ES cells. These genetically modified ES cells can then be injected back into early embryos, where they will become incorporated into the developing embryo and give rise to tissues and cells that carry the introduced genetic modification. By studying the effects of these genetic manipulations on development and physiology, researchers can gain a better understanding of mammalian molecular biology. When ES cells are injected back into the inner cell mass of another early embryo, they take part in the formation of a well-formed chimeric animal. The project was first announced by UK Prime Minister David Cameron in December 2012. The Government set up a new company Genomics England to oversee the project with the plan to focus on rare diseases, cancer and infectious diseases announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in July 2013. In 2016, the Welsh government issued a statement of intent and is considering participating in \n\n Genomics England is a British company set up and owned by the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Care to run the 100,000 Genomes Project. In summer 2019, Chris Wigley was appointed CEO of Genomics England, starting in October 2019. The three methods used to produce genetically modified animals, such as transgenic mice and knockout mice, are as follows:\n\n1. If successful, the modified embryos are implanted into the uterus of a foster animal for further development. Genetic Modification of Cultured Embryonic Stem Cells: This method involves genetically modifying cultured embryonic stem cells. The desired gene or genetic modification is engineered into these stem cells. The engineered stem cells are then injected into an embryo at the blastocyst stage. This results in the creation of a chimeric animal. If some of the modified stem cells enter the germline (sperm or egg cells), the genetic modification can be passed on to the animal's descendants. Reproductive Cloning with Genetically Modified Embryonic Stem Cells: In this method, the gene of interest is engineered into embryonic stem cells.

First discovered in 1882 by Robert Koch, M. tuberculosis has an unusual, waxy coating on its cell surface primarily due to the presence of mycolic acid. Acid-fast stains such as Ziehl–Neelsen, or fluorescent stains such as auramine are used instead to identify M. tuberculosis with a microscope. Primarily a pathogen of the mammalian respiratory system, it infects the lungs. The most frequently used diagnostic methods for tuberculosis are the tuberculin skin test, acid-fast stain, culture, and polymerase chain reaction. Tuberculosis of the lung and other organs was described in Chapter 8. Chronic pneumonias caused by fungi are discussed here. Like M. tuberculosis, H. capsulatum is an intracellular pathogen that is found mainly in phagocytes. M. tuberculosis, then known as the \"tubercle bacillus\", was first described on 24 March 1882 by Robert Koch, who subsequently received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery in 1905; the bacterium is also known as \"Koch's bacillus\". M. tuberculosis has existed throughout history, but the name has changed frequently over time. In 1720, though, the history of tuberculosis started to take shape into what is known of it today; as the physician Benjamin Marten described in his A Theory of Consumption, tuberculosis may be caused by small living creatures transmitted through the air to other patients. M. tuberculosis is easily passed through the air by sneezing, coughing, or simply talking. A contaminated droplet can infect any person and they can become contaminated with M. tuberculosis. The lungs are a common sight, however, for infections because the natural environment of the lungs is moist and well oxygenated--a perfect breeding ground for bacteria to grow. Infections compromise the ability to move oxygen through the system, so lung infections can be very serious. Tuberculosis kills 2 million people a year worldwide, according to MayoClinic.com. Tuberculosis is a respiratory infection that is spread from person to person by airborne droplets. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the pathogen responsible for this disease. When tuberculosis pathogens enter the lungs, they begin to multiply. Actinomycosis israelii causes lung infections that show up as a mass on X-rays. This type of lung infection involves other bacteria as well, such as Staphylococci and Streptococci, according to The Merck Manuals. Actinomycosis of the lung can resemble tuberculosis on X-rays. Infections with M. tuberculosis are more common than nontubercular mycobacterial infections. Histoplasmosis is the most common endemic mycosis in the USA, prevalent in the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and is the most common fungal infection associated with TNF-α therapy in adults and children, either as a newly acquired infection or by reactivation or reinfection [96, 81].\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

For instance, e-cigarettes were illegal in Japan, which forced the market to use heat-not-burn tobacco products for cigarette alternatives. , around two thirds of major nations have regulated e-cigarettes in some way. Because of the potential relationship with tobacco laws and medical drug policies, e-cigarette \n\n San Luis Obispo, California, became the first city in the world to restrict indoor smoking in bars as well as in restaurants. The ban did not include workplaces, but covered all other indoor public spaces and its enforcement was somewhat limited. In the United States, California's 1998 smoking ban encouraged other states such as New York to implement similar regulations. California's ban included a controversial restriction upon smoking in bars, extending the statewide ban enacted in 1994. As of April 2009, there were 37 states with some form of smoking ban. Some areas in California began banning smoking across whole cities, including every place \n\n in that year. In June 2018, San Francisco residents voted to outlaw the sale of flavored tobacco products, including e-liquids and menthol cigarettes, in the city. The ban was supported by groups including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, African American American Tobacco Control Leadership Council, and Tobacco-Free Kids Action Fund. Similar bans have passed in California in the cities of Oakland and Sonoma as well \n\nA new study that was recently published in the International Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, led by Riccardo Polosa, MD, PhD (Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine of the University of Catania, Italy), suggests that electronic cigarette (EC) use may reverse some of the harm resulting from tobacco smoking in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The Union ministry of health and family welfare released an advisory on August 28, 2018, asking all states to prohibit sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery System (ENDS) or e-cigarettes. The central government of India is advising state governments to ban vapes, based on questionable scientific reasoning. The “Advisory on Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems” was sent Tuesday by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare to the health departments of all 29 states. India’s federal health ministry called on Tuesday for stopping the sale or import of electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn tobacco devices that companies like Philip Morris International Inc were planning to launch in the country. Plans to ban tobacco in prison were announced last year amid growing concern about the health risks of passive smoking. Vaping kits will be issued from the start of November, before the ban comes into force at the end of the month. The number of teens who reported using tobacco products declined from 4.5 million to 3.6 million from 2011 to 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fifteen years ago, a Chinese pharmacist sparked a global innovation race to end smoking by inventing a safer, more appealing way for smokers to get the nicotine they desire without the smoke that may kill them–the modern day e-cigarette. But smokers trying to switch to vaping face a host of obstacles. How does dual use of e-cigarettes and conventional cigarettes change over time? These devices gained popularity so rapidly that by 2014, the verb vape—to describe inhaling e-cigarette vapor—was the Oxford English Dictionary‘s new word of the year (1). Despite their name, e-cigarettes are fundamentally different from conventional cigarettes that burn tobacco and produce smoke. Instead, e-cigarettes are nicotine delivery devices that heat a liquid containing nicotine, solvents, and usually flavorings, producing an aerosol that users inhale (1). Background: Contemporary data on the prevalence of e-cigarette use in the United States are limited. , 180 localities in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, and Rhode Island as well as two US states—Maine and New Jersey—restrict the sale of flavored tobacco products. In June 2019, San Francisco became the first major U.S. city to put a ban on the sale and distribution of all e-cigarettes including flavored ones. The major e-cigarette company in San Francisco, JUUL spent over $18.6 million to the Proposition C campaign into a November ballot initiative in hopes to overturn the ban.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Some advocates of breast-feeding suggest that breast milk can be used to ease all sorts of infections and problems that infants deal with, and they even go so far as to recommend mothers put a bit of breast milk in their child's ear to ease ear infections and ear pain. They also recommend breast milk in the eye for eye infections or pinkeye. Further uses suggested for any spare breast milk you might have around the house include clearing a stuffed-up nose, soothing diaper rashes, easing a sore throat, removing makeup, and healing mosquito bites. As pediatricians, we absolutely endorse breast-feeding. Good scientific studies have linked breast-feeding to lower rates of ear infections, infections that cause diarrhea and vomiting, eczema, asthma, and obesity.Breast milk contains both the white blood cells that gobble up germs (macrophages) and a protective protein (immunoglobulin A) that coats the lining of a baby's stomach and can help prevent germs from getting through.Breast milk also contains antibodies that the mother's body has made against particular germs. Low birth weight and premature babies are at a greater risk for various complications due to their underdeveloped immune system and incomplete lung development. The earlier the gestational age and the lower the birth weight, the higher the risk of infection. Infections are particularly challenging to diagnose and treat in preemies, as they are already very sick. Some of the risks associated with low birth weight and premature babies include:\n\n1. Infections: Preemies have an immature immune system, making them more vulnerable to infections such as pneumonia, sepsis, and meningitis. Respiratory problems: Premature babies often have underdeveloped lungs, leading to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease, and an increased risk of developing pneumatoceles or air-filled spaces in the lungs. Feeding difficulties: Premature babies may have difficulty sucking, swallowing, and coordinating their breathing, which can lead to feeding problems and poor weight gain. Neurological issues: Premature babies are at a higher risk of experiencing developmental delays, learning disabilities, and neurodevelopmental disorders such as cerebral palsy. Poor growth: Low birth weight babies may have difficulties with weight gain and growth, requiring additional nutritional support. It is important for healthcare providers to closely monitor and provide specialized care for low birth weight and premature babies to mitigate these risks and improve their outcomes. It has been postulated that 13% of the current under-five mortality rate could be averted by promoting proper breastfeeding practices, which is seemingly the single most cost effective intervention to reduce child mortality in resource-constrained settings such as in Nepal. Long before a newborn is able to drink by himself, a nurse can rub a few drops of colostrum on the gums and tongue to get breast milk&apos;s immune-boosting benefits started. When your baby is ready to take a bottle, his stomach is still so small that he needs only a little. If you&apos;re pumping regularly, your milk supply should increase with your baby&apos;s growing needs. Once you begin nursing, keep in mind that premature babies will feed more slowly than full-term infants, so be patient and allow adequate time for each session. \"It&apos;s incredibly beneficial for a premature newborn&apos;s immune system, especially the initial colostrum,\" says Dr. Sajous. Studies show that premature babies who are fed breast milk have fewer readmissions to the hospital following their discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and show greater gains in cognitive development than formula-fed preemies. Prevention includes the use of breast milk and probiotics. A 2012 policy by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding \"significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,\" including reducing the rate of NEC by a factor of one-half to three-quarters. Human milk from a milk bank or donor can be used if mother's milk is unavailable.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the realm of robotic surgeries, Temple University anesthesiologists are studying the effects of robotically assisted approaches on perioperative physiology and anesthetically important outcomes. Specifically, they are investigating the incidence and possible causes of late respiratory failure in patients undergoing prolonged retroperitoneal dissections under robotic guidance. This research aims to better understand the challenges presented by factors such as prolonged CO2 insufflation and extreme positioning during robotic surgeries. Ongoing scholarly efforts within this initiative focus on areas such as reducing surgical site infections and optimizing perioperative pain management. By redesigning the care process, researchers aim to enhance patient outcomes and reduce complications. Safer Surgery by Learning from Complications: A Focus on Robotic Prostate Surgery: This study focuses on robotic prostate surgery and how learning from complications can lead to safer surgical techniques. The Comparative Harms of Open and Robotic Prostatectomy in Population Based Samples: This study compares the harms associated with open and robotic prostatectomy procedures. By assessing the risks and complications of each approach, researchers aim to inform surgical decision-making and improve patient outcomes. The use of a robotic surgery system in performing prophylactic gastrectomy for patients with Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) offers several advantages. Firstly, the robotic surgery system allows for articulated movement of the robotic instruments, which enhances the surgeon's dexterity and precision during the procedure. This is particularly important in intricate surgeries such as prophylactic gastrectomy, where the removal of the stomach requires meticulous attention to detail. Secondly, the robotic surgery system eliminates tremor, further enhancing the precision of the surgical movements. Another important advantage is the 3D vision provided by the robotic surgery system. Additionally, the use of a robotic surgery system in prophylactic gastrectomy for HDGC patients allows for a minimally invasive approach. This means that smaller incisions are made, leading to less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery. In summary, the advantages of using a robotic surgery system in performing prophylactic gastrectomy for patients with HDGC include enhanced dexterity and precision, elimination of tremor, improved visualization, and the benefits of a minimally invasive approach. These advantages contribute to safer and more effective surgical outcomes for patients with HDGC. One advantage of using the computerized method is that the surgeon does not have to be present, leading to the possibility for remote surgery. This technique has not been approved for cancer surgery as of 2019 as the safety and usefulness is unclear. Major advances aided by surgical robots have been remote surgery, minimally invasive surgery and unmanned surgery. Due to robotic use, the surgery is done with precision, miniaturization, smaller incisions; decreased blood loss, less pain, and quicker healing time.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These problems are so common, it is no wonder that prescriptions for testosterone have increased five-fold since 2000 — yet only 50% of men actually have hypogonadism. Evidence linking testosterone and heart problems has been growing since at least 2009, when researchers halted a clinical trial after 7% of men on testosterone had a cardiovascular event, compared to 1% on a placebo. One study found that men over 65 had twice as many heart attacks as men who did not take testosterone. Another study found that men on testosterone were nearly 30% more likely to have a heart attack, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular event in the first 90 days of treatment. Due to an increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to a placebo group, a Testosterone in Older Men with Mobility Limitations (TOM) trial (a National Institute of Aging randomized trial) was halted early by the Data Safety and Monitoring Committee. The FDA now requires warnings in the drug labeling of all approved testosterone products regarding deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Up to the year 2010, studies had not shown any effect on the risk of death, prostate cancer or cardiovascular disease; more recent studies, however, do raise concerns. A 2013 study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, reported \"the use of testosterone therapy was significantly associated with increased risk of adverse outcomes.\" , a number of lawsuits are underway against manufacturers of testosterone, alleging a significantly increased rate of stroke and heart attack in elderly men who use testosterone supplementation. A possible cause for these symptoms is a low level of testosterone, a condition that is not a normal part of aging. In recent years, gels and topical treatments have come into popularity for treating low testosterone. They allege that they suffered heart attacks or strokes while on the testosterone replacement. There are those in the medical profession that consider gels and topical treatments to potentially be dangerous drugs to treat low testosterone. Because each person has different absorption rates and the treatment relies on the person to apply it himself, the treatment can be inconsistent and result in abnormally high levels of testosterone. If you have been prescribed AndroGel or another gel or topical treatment for low testosterone and have experienced adverse side effects with its use, you may wish to speak with a personal injury attorney regarding your right to compensation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While human cases of EEE and West Nile are rare, both diseases can cause serious illness, permanent disability, and even death. Lyme disease is caused by a bacteria spread by infected deer ticks and can occur at any time of the year when the temperature is above freezing. Each year, the risks of Eastern Equine Encephalitis, West Nile virus and Lyme disease cause concern among residents and prompt response by public health officials. This is especially true this year, as threats of EEE and West Nile virus are above normal, and the incidence of Lyme disease, along with other tick-borne illnesses such as babesiosis, continues to be high. Because of the increased threats of these diseases this year, the Massachusetts Medical Society, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and HCAM-TV have collaborated in producing a special edition of Physician Focus to raise awareness of these illnesses and encourage residents to take appropriate steps to protect themselves. Among the topics covered in this program by Dr. DeMaria and Dr. Brown are the dangers these threats pose to humans; the environmental conditions that contribute to these risks; why the risks of these diseases are greater this year than in previous years; control efforts undertaken by state and local agencies; who is most susceptible to getting these diseases; what you should do if you’ve been bitten by a tick; and the most effective steps individuals can take to protect against mosquito and tick bites. Control efforts by state and local public health agencies, such as ground and aerial spraying, are important in reducing the risks, but they can’t eliminate the risks entirely, say the doctors. Besides the discussion among the doctors, Mosquito and Tick-Borne Diseases contains two new public service announcements recorded by the guests. One focuses on mosquito-borne illnesses, and one on Lyme disease. DO YOU VACCINATE FOR LYME DISEASE?? Now that the warmer weather is approaching, so is the threat of Lyme disease and other tick borne diseases. WHAT CAUSES LYME DISEASE? Lyme disease is caused by bacteria transmitted by ticks, specifically deer ticks. IS YOUR DOG IN DANGER OF GETTING LYME DISEASE? Is it likely you would miss seeing a tick nymph the size of a pin head on your dog? High levels may warrant being treated with an antibiotic, and our Lyme vaccine protocol. all ticks are infected. In most places in the US, 30-50% of deer ticks will be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease). The Laboratory of Medical Zoology (LMZ), a nonprofit lab at the University of Massachusetts, provides a comprehensive TickReport for a variety of human pathogens and makes the data available to the public. Those wishing to know the incidence of tick-borne diseases in their town or state can search the LMZ surveillance database. Another issue that exists with high deer density is the spreading of infectious diseases. Increased deer populations lead to increased transmission of tick-borne diseases, which pose a threat to human health, to livestock, and to other deer. Deer are the primary host and vector for the adult black-legged tick, which transmits the Lyme disease bacterium to humans. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the country and is found in twelve states in Eastern America. Furthermore, the incidence of Lyme disease seems to reflect deer density in the eastern United States, which suggests a strong correlation. White-tailed deer also serve as intermediate hosts for many diseases that infect humans through ticks, such as Rocky Mountain \n\n Like all ticks, it can be a vector of diseases including human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis), canine and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI, possibly caused by the spirochete Borrelia lonestari). Though the primary bacterium responsible for Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has occasionally been isolated from lone star ticks, numerous vector competency tests have demonstrated that this tick is extremely unlikely to be capable of transmitting Lyme disease. In 2013, in response to two cases of severe febrile illness occurring in two farmers in northwestern Missouri, researchers determined the lone star tick can transmit the heartland virus.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

However, misinformation about vaccines has led some parents to question their safety and effectiveness, contributing to vaccine hesitancy. This hesitancy has allowed the measles virus to regain strength and spread more easily in certain communities. The consequences of vaccine hesitancy are serious. In the United States, although rare, approximately 1 to 2 out of every 1,000 children who contract measles die from the disease. Furthermore, measles is highly contagious, with approximately 90% of unvaccinated individuals who come into contact with someone infected with measles becoming infected themselves. In addition, unvaccinated individuals traveling abroad or foreign visitors who are infected with measles can bring the virus into the United States. Measles outbreaks have occurred in various countries, and travelers can unknowingly import the virus. In April, the CDC reported that 400,000 fewer doses of measles vaccine were ordered in 2020 compared to the same time last year. May 2017 saw a return of measles to the US after an outbreak in Minnesota among unvaccinated children. Another outbreak occurred in the state of New York between 2018 and 2019, causing over 200 confirmed measles cases in mostly ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities. Subsequent outbreaks occurred in New Jersey and Washington state with over 30 cases reported in the Pacific Northwest. The state will still pay even if the vaccination was not administered by them. However, when there is hesitancy or reluctance towards vaccines, it puts individuals and communities at risk. Mistrust of vaccines can reverse the progress made in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, diphtheria, or rubella. These statistics highlight the potential consequences of vaccine hesitancy and the importance of vaccination in preventing the spread of highly contagious diseases like measles. The main reasons for vaccine hesitation, according to the WHO, include complacency, inconvenience related to access to vaccines, and lack of trust.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Each of the six new centers will focus on basic research, surveillance studies or both. “The current strategy of relying on vaccines that match each year?s particular strain imposes severe limitations on our ability to prepare for a pandemic,” said John J. Treanor M.D., professor of Medicine and of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Yes, it is possible for another pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu to occur in the future. While there have been significant advancements in vaccine development, such as the ongoing development of a universal flu vaccine that could be given every 10 years, more effort and resources are needed to effectively prevent future pandemics. In fact, Dr. Osterholm believes that a universal flu vaccine could greatly benefit public health worldwide and have a major economic impact by potentially preventing future pandemics. Additionally, investing in the development and availability of vaccines, antiviral medications, and effective healthcare systems can help mitigate the impact of a pandemic. In conclusion, while it is possible for another pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu to occur in the future, taking comprehensive measures such as improving vaccine development, increasing funding and effort for research and preparedness, and promoting public awareness can greatly minimize its impact. More recently, Biondvax (NASDAQ:BVXV) undertook a two year, more than 12,400 participant phase 3 study of Multimeric-001, its candidate universal influenza vaccine. In 2008, Acambis announced work on a universal flu vaccine (ACAM-FLU-ATM) based on the less variable M2 protein component \n\n the flu virus shell. See also H5N1 vaccines. In 2010, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the U.S. NIH announced a breakthrough; the effort targets the stem, which mutates less often than the head of the viral HA. By 2010 some universal flu vaccines had started clinical trials. Inovio's SynCon DNA vaccines include H5N1 and H1N1 subtypes. It is called the New York Influenza Center of Excellence (NYICE) and is a collaboration between the University of Rochester, Cornell University, the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, and community partners. The funding for this research center is part of a larger initiative by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which aims to support research on flu prevention and treatment. This center, along with five other centers across the country, will receive a total of approximately $138 million in funding over seven years for their flu research efforts.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Trump called the House Democrats' bill \"a big bailout for badly run Democratic cities \n\n who get up every day and go do oftentimes pretty menial work at some of these jobs. In April 2020, amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Senate passed $484 billion in relief with most funding going to refill the coffers of the Paycheck Protection Program. On proposals for a new round of coronavirus economic relief legislation, Trump blamed Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi for the failure of relief legislation to pass, although Pelosi was in the midst of negotiating a relief bill with Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven \n\n Biggs opposes wearing masks to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, encouraging Arizonans not to wear them. He has called for the White House Coronavirus Task Force to be disbanded. On March 4, 2020, Biggs and Ken Buck were the only two representatives to vote against an $8.3 billion COVID-19 aid package. Ten days later, he voted against the larger Coronavirus Response Act, saying that because it provided benefits to domestic partners, it \"redefined the family.\" In December 2020, Biggs called on Trump to veto the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which included $900 billion in stimulus relief for the pandemic. The legislation was the first bill to address the pandemic since April 2020. On March 4, 2020, the bill passed the House on an overwhelming 415&ndash;2 vote. On the House floor shortly before the vote on the bill, Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, the sponsor of the bill and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said, \"While we all ardently hope that this public health emergency does not worsen, House Democrats will not hesitate to act again if we must augment this funding with more resources.\" Gaetz received criticism from Representative Bobby Rush for \"making light\" of the coronavirus pandemic, and also from Walter Shaub, the former director of the United States Office of Government Ethics, who stated \"Matt Gaetz mocked fear over the coronavirus.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Black women account for over 28% of abortions yearly, more than any other racial demographic. This statistic accounts for the reality that African American women also experience high unintended pregnancy rates, largely due to lack of access to comprehensive reproductive care, including birth control. African American anti-abortionist ideals threaten the access that Black women have gained to reproductive care, something that is harmful given the high rates of unintended pregnancy and STIs, including HIV, in the Black community. During this time the Black Panthers printed pamphlets which described abortion as black genocide, expanding on their earlier stance with regard to family planning. By the mid-1970s, the federal government had reduced funding for fertility control and family planning programs were viewed as less favorable after Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court abortion case. Given this context, groups such as the Black Panther's expanded their emphasis on total health care to include birth control and abortion when voluntarily chosen. In mid-1973 news stories revealed the forced sterilization of poor black women and children, paid for by federal funds. Two girls of the Relf family in Mississippi, deemed mentally incompetent at ages 12 and 14, and \n\n York, conducted by the National Organization for Women (NOW), found that 75% of blacks supported the decriminalization of abortion. Johnson cast the issue as one which polarized the black community along gender lines: black women generally viewed abortion as a \"blessing in disguise\" but black men such as Reverend Jesse Jackson viewed it as black genocide.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It is a blood test that is typically performed during the 19th or 20th week of pregnancy and measures protein levels in the blood that are highly predictive of premature birth. By knowing their risk, women have the opportunity to plan and prepare for a potential premature delivery. Traditional methods of predicting premature birth, such as measuring the cervix or considering previous history of premature delivery, may not accurately predict the majority of women who will actually deliver prematurely. The PreTRM test is designed to be predictive of preterm delivery when used on women pregnant with a single baby. The accuracy of the PreTRM test has been rigorously validated in a large clinical study involving 5,500 women across multiple obstetric centers in the United States. By knowing their risk of premature delivery, women can work with their healthcare providers to create an individualized plan for their pregnancy and potentially receive additional care from specialists in high-risk pregnancies. This proactive approach can help improve the chances of having a healthy baby. With PreTRM, Your blood is tested during your 19th or 20th week of pregnancy, which detects protein levels in your blood that are highly predictive of premature birth. Traditional methods to predict premature birth, such as measuring your cervix or your previous history of a premature baby, fail to predict the vast majority of women who will deliver their babies prematurely. The PreTRM testing procedure measures proteins in the blood that are highly predictive of babies being born prematurely. The PreTRM test is predictive of preterm delivery in women pregnant with a single baby when blood is tested during your 19th or 20th week of pregnancy and has reported “spontaneous* premature birth prediction” Area Under the Curve (AUC) ranging between 0.75 and 0.935, where a 1.0 score is “perfect” and a .50 score is the same as chance. The test’s accuracy was rigorously validated in a large clinical study involving 5,500 women in 11 obstetric centers across the U.S. The PreTRM test gives you a percentage risk of delivering before 37 weeks, comparing your personal risk to the average risk of all women pregnant with a single baby. The result of the PreTRM test is not a positive or negative (yes or no) result but an “individual risk prediction” of having your baby too early. If you are shown to be higher than average risk for all pregnancies, which is 7.3% for Spontaneous premature birth for all women pregnant with a single baby, there are established treatments that you and your doctor can consider to address your risk. After a PreTRM test, you will have necessary information so that you can plan and be prepared for a potential early delivery. A blood test is ordered for testing in your 19th or 20th week of pregnancy. Levels of the protein called elafin: Studies have found that elevated levels of elafin may indicate a higher risk of going into early labor. This test aims to provide a non-invasive method of identifying women at risk. By monitoring cervical length, researchers can identify those at higher risk. Drugs used to prevent heart disease: It has been observed that certain medications used for heart disease prevention may help in delaying preterm birth. High blood pressure: Tommy's is supporting a trial to develop the best treatment approach for pregnant women with high blood pressure, aiming to minimize harm to both mother and baby. Unusual amyloid proteins: Scientists are investigating the potential of using unusual amyloid proteins to predict the development of pre-eclampsia, a condition that can lead to premature birth. Androgens: Hormones called androgens are being studied for their potential to prevent premature labor or induce labor when there is distress in the baby. These ongoing research efforts aim to improve our understanding of risk factors and ultimately help identify strategies for preventing premature birth and supporting healthy pregnancies. The finance world is abuzz with the prospect of a new lucrative pharmaceutical market: the preterm birth diagnostic test kit market. Market analysts expect recent innovations and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to create a demand among hospitals and other medical providers who may be able to test reliably for the possibility of preterm birth for the first time in medical history. Until recently, the best way to predict imminent preterm labor was to use a test with a negative predictive value, which is a test that measured a woman’s likelihood that she wouldn’t experience preterm birth. Though it was the best option available, it failed to accurately predict many preterm births, and mothers and newborns suffered. Scientists have recently developed two new tests that may predict preterm birth more accurately, and hopefully provide opportunities for at-risk mothers to take preventative steps and carry their babies to term. The FDA approved the first new style of test in April, 2018. It assesses the risk of preterm birth in women with the symptoms of preterm labor with a greater accuracy that any other test doctors could use. The PAMG-1 predicts the risk of preterm labor with a positive predictive value, or with the likelihood a woman will give spontaneous preterm birth. It has vastly improved doctors’ evaluation and subsequent treatment options for pregnant patients with the symptoms of preterm labor. Even more recently, scientists identified genetic markers in a mothers’ cell-free RNA that are positive predictors of preterm birth. When used in conjunction with ultrasounds, the studies of this new blood test are promising. More cost-effective than other methods, the blood test should be very popular among medical providers and patients. The new test is so promising, in fact, that the financial as well as the medical world is talking about it. The new diagnostic methods are hitting the market just in time to hopefully reverse this rising trend. The lungs, liver, and brain need the full term of pregnancy to develop correctly. These are among the reasons why advances in diagnostics are so important. Medical History – Prior preterm birth increases the risk of future premature births. Maternal Infections – Maternal infections increase the risk of delivering preterm. Preeclampsia – Preeclampsia almost always results in premature birth. Multiples – Carrying multiple babies (twins, etc) increases the risk. These same signs after 37 weeks indicate regular, full-term labor as well.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This included helping with joint stiffness and a slight improvement on the narrowing of joint space that is associated with the condition. Furthermore, a 2015 study in Scientific Reports found glucosamine (another natural compound found in cartilage) and chondroitin together were more effective at relieving symptoms for people with knee arthritis than taking chondroitin on its own. Holland & Barrett explains what it is: “Chondroitin is one of the building blocks of cartilage - the tough tissue that acts as a shock absorber around the joints in humans and animals. “It’s chondroitin’s job to help your cartilage hang on to water - increasing its elasticity. Chondroitin is available in tablets, capsules and patches, and is often combined with glucosamine. The National Institute for Care and Excellence (NIC) doesn’t currently recommend chondroitin for the treatment of osteoarthritis. But if you decide to take it, the high street health store advises: “Recent trials have seen adults take doses of 800-1200mg of chondroitin sulphate per day, often divided into smaller doses. Another supplement recommended to help relieve painful symptoms of arthritis is turmeric. Arthritis Foundation explains: “Curcumin is the chemical in turmeric that can reduce joint pain and swelling by blocking inflammatory cytokines and enzymes. “A 2010 clinical trial using a turmeric supplement showed long-term improvement in pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Omega-3 supplements may also help ease arthritis pain. There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis. Depending on the type of arthritis, the medications that are given may be different. For example, the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen (paracetamol) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. For more severe cases of osteoarthritis, intra-articular corticosteroid injections may also be considered. Of these, osteoarthritis is the fastest increasing major health condition. Recommended medications may depend on the form of arthritis. The term is derived from arthr- (meaning 'joint') and -itis (meaning 'inflammation'). Find out which supplements helps ease inflammation and strengthen bones, and which don’t. Fish oil, calcium, and vitamin D are three supplements with proven benefits for ankylosing spondylitis. If you have a chronic condition like ankylosing spondylitis, the idea of using dietary supplements to help ease your symptoms can prove enticing. Medication and exercise are commonly prescribed to help ease the pain, swelling, and other symptoms associated with ankylosing spondylitis. However, some touted supplements for ankylosing spondylitis, such as glucosamine and chondroitin, have no proven benefits. Research has shown that a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids can help reduce joint inflammation and medication use in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), another inflammatory joint condition. Although omega-3s have been well studied for RA, less research has been conducted on their effectiveness for ankylosing spondylitis. \"A small study out of Europe found that these supplements may benefit people with ankylosing spondylitis.\" The Swedish researchers noted, however, that larger and better-controlled studies are needed before conclusions should be made about the use of omega-3s to help treat ankylosing spondylitis. \"People with ankylosing spondylitis can help maintain their bone health with calcium and vitamin D supplements,\" Dr. Tehrani says. Glucosamine and chondroitin. Glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate are naturally found in and around the cells of cartilage. This is different than osteoarthritis, a degenerative disease involving the deterioration of cartilage over time. \"Chondroitin and glucosamine have primarily been studied for use in people with degenerative arthritis, or osteoarthritis, and may not work for inflammatory arthritis,\" Dr. Louie says. \"These supplements would be taken for bone health and cartilage maintenance, but have not been shown to have an effect on people with ankylosing spondylitis.\" He also stresses that, because of the lack of controlled studies with conclusive evidence on the benefits of vitamins or minerals for ankylosing spondylitis, supplements shouldn’t be routinely recommended to people with the condition. \"These people often end up seeing no benefits to ankylosing spondylitis from these products.\"\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

One such option is Robotic Assisted Partial Knee Resurfacing. This procedure is more appropriate for patients with partial osteoarthritis of the knee. It allows for a quicker recovery and better surgical results compared to total knee replacement. It's important to consult with an orthopedic joint specialist to determine the most suitable treatment option for your specific condition. What affects the final cost of Knee Replacement? A total knee replacement may be necessary for patients who have severe damage to the knee joint and for whom less invasive treatments such as physical therapy are not helping. Your surgeon may also recommend a partial knee replacement if the damage is less severe, which uses more of the existing tissue and removes less bone. Patients whose knees have been severely damaged by conditions such as arthritis or trauma may be candidates for knee replacement surgery. Serious rehabilitation is necessary after surgery, and many patients report substantial post-operative pain. The final price depends on whether the procedure is a full or partial knee replacement. For more information, read our Knee Replacement Cost Guide. Reportedly, that particular SDR enabled the young woman to ambulate, whereas before the surgery, she was too tight to do so. Knee-high stockings are more comfortable, easier to apply, and wearing them increases patients' compliance with treatment. Knee-high stockings are easier to size for limb measurement than thigh-high compression stockings. Consequently, 22% of thigh-high wearers and 14% of knee-high wearers stopped the treatment. Why consult an orthopedic joint specialist? You may have non-surgical, partial, or full joint replacement options depending on your diagnosis. The most common surgical knee intervention performed for osteoarthritis (OA) is a total knee replacement , and is usually offered to patients with advanced osteoarthritis of the knee. To aid quick recovery from total knee replacement surgery, we often recommend the muscle sparing approach with total knee replacement. This is a technique that allows for quicker recovery and better surgical results. However, total knee replacement is not always optimal for patients with early- to mid-stage osteoarthritis in just one or two compartments of the knee. These procedures are very successful at relieving pain, increasing motion, and improving quality of life. Patients also report better range of motion and a more natural feeling knee compared to traditional replacement surgery. If joint replacement is decided upon, a full knee replacement or hip replacement treatment plan is developed. Early stages of treatment include conservative treatment such as physical therapy and injections. When patients suffering with a painful joint wish to delay or avoid surgery we are happy to provide these services. These include bracing, anti-inflammatories and state-of-the-art injection services.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These symptoms usually peak a few days after cessation of chronic marijuana use. Compared to heavy opioid or alcohol use, the withdrawal symptoms observed in chronic marijuana users are generally milder and rarely require medical or pharmacologic intervention. Reference:\n- (Adapted) Withdrawal signs and symptoms observed in chronic marijuana users are usually relatively mild in comparison to those observed in heavy opioid or alcohol users and rarely require medical or pharmacologic intervention. Improved sleep: Some patients experience better sleep quality and duration with medical marijuana use. Neurological disorders: Medical marijuana has shown promise in managing symptoms of conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Psychiatric effects: There is evidence suggesting that marijuana use, particularly in adolescence, may be associated with an increased risk of developing psychosis later in life. Cognitive impairment: Long-term marijuana use may impact cognitive function, particularly in heavy users. Respiratory issues: Smoking marijuana can have similar effects on the lungs as smoking tobacco, potentially leading to respiratory problems. Addiction potential: While the risk of marijuana addiction is relatively low compared to other substances, some individuals may develop dependence or addictive behaviors. Interactions with medications: Medical marijuana can interact with certain medications, leading to potential adverse effects or decreased effectiveness. One important consideration is that marijuana can have negative effects on mental health. Additionally, heavy and prolonged use of marijuana can lead to cognitive impairments, including problems with memory, attention, and decision-making. Another concern is the impact of marijuana on the respiratory system. Smoking marijuana can cause irritation and damage to the lungs similar to tobacco smoke. Marijuana also affects cardiovascular health. In rare cases, marijuana use has been linked to heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, there are potential risks associated with driving under the influence of marijuana. It is important for physicians to consider these potential harmful effects when discussing marijuana use with their patients.

However, empirical research on the effects of cannabis on users’ motivation implies that there is no strong correlation and that there are numerous alternative explanations of these negative outcomes as a review of laboratory performance research, education data, and employment statistics fail to offer consistent evidence that directly link cannabis to any symptoms associated with amotivational syndrome. Though several studies contain data in which heavy cannabis users have reported feeling a lack of motivation, it has also been acknowledged that other variables such as comorbid drug use and baselines for low motivation may not be examined. In excessive amounts, THC can cause hallucinations, panic attacks, and vomiting, although these are less commonly observed in frequent or experienced users. Chronic marijuana use may potentially lead to psychological, neurobiological, and general health problems. It's important to be aware of these potential risks associated with heavy marijuana use.

It is estimated that more than 54,000 people die in the country because of HIV/AIDS, which spreads through infected needles or getting in touch with the other body fluids of an infected individual. HIV/AIDS cannot be cured, but its symptoms and aggressiveness can be controlled through proper treatment. Patients who contract HIV and eventually get AIDS get infected easily from by common bacterial and viral infections. Their immune system is terribly weakened and as HIV/AIDS symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue, night sweat and sore throat manifest themselves. Coronary Heart Disease: Commonly referred to as CHD, this category of illness kills more than 9,000 people in Kenya each year. The condition cannot be cured completely, but treatment is available to control the symptoms and improve the health status of the patient. It is estimated that more than 45,000 patients in Kenya die because of influenza and pneumonia, which is about 13.5 percent of the total deaths in a year. Diarrhoeal Disease: It is the second leading cause of death in children aged under five around the world and kills more than 23,000 people in Kenya every year. Brain Trauma: A traumatic brain injury is the fifth leading cause of death in Kenya. It kills more than 14,000 people in Kenya each year. It kills more than 14,600 people in Kenya every year. Liver Disease: Liver disease kills more than 3,600 people in Kenya each year. Fatty liver disease, Alcoholic hepatitis, Hepatitis A, B and C, liver cirrhosis and hemochromatosis are some of the major liver diseases that affect people of Kenya. It kills more than 3,600 people in Kenya each year. Oesophagus Cancer: The cancer of the oesophagus kills more than 3,000 people in Kenya each year. Kidney Disease: It kills more than 3,000 people in Kenya each year. people in Kenya living with HIV/AIDs was 1 500 000 and the prevalence rate was 4.8% of the total population. The incidence rate was 1.21 per 1000 population among all ages and more than 75% of the total population are on antiretroviral therapy.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning today that an HIV outbreak in Indiana could be a harbinger of similar outbreaks around the country. ANDERS KELTO, BYLINE: Jonathan Mermin, the director of the CDC's Center for HIV and AIDS, says the root of the problem is prescription painkillers. In many parts of the country, he says, people are injecting themselves with prescription opioids, and injection drug use has caused an unprecedented rise in cases of hepatitis C, a virus that can be spread from people sharing needles. And HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, spreads the same way. So the CDC is worried that outbreaks of HIV might follow outbreaks of hepatitis, just like in Indiana. Basically, it's telling doctors and health departments to take a number of steps to stop outbreaks from developing. They need to screen more people for HIV and the hepatitis C virus, or HCV. KELTO: That way they can detect outbreaks early. The CDC is also asking state health agencies to make sure addiction and counseling services are available and to track and report new cases of HIV and hepatitis, so the disease doesn't spread. MERMIN: The situation in Indiana should serve as a warning that we cannot let down our guard against these deadly infections. KELTO: Because just like in Indiana, Mermin says, they can come back and spread quickly. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) claimed in 2006 that more than 16 percent of adults in Kenya are HIV-infected. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) cites the much lower figure of 6.7 percent. Despite politically charged disputes over the numbers, however, the Kenyan government recently declared HIV/AIDS a national disaster. In 2004 the Kenyan Ministry of Health announced that HIV/AIDS had surpassed malaria and tuberculosis as the leading disease killer in the country. Due largely to AIDS, life expectancy in Kenya has dropped by about a decade. Since 1984 more than 1.5 million Kenyans have died because of HIV/AIDS.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Several studies have shown that statins, which are commonly used to lower high cholesterol levels, are also associated with decreased risks of prostate cancer. It has been observed that as statin use increased in the 1990s, prostate cancer mortality rates went down. In a specific study comparing high cholesterol levels to prostate cancer mortality rates among states over time periods with varying levels of statin use, it was found that high cholesterol levels correlated inversely with prostate cancer mortality. This means that higher cholesterol levels were associated with lower prostate cancer mortality rates during periods of high statin use. To ensure that the observed correlation was not influenced by factors such as medical care access, socioeconomic status, urbanization, family income, and health insurance status, these factors were taken into consideration in the analysis. Overall, the evidence suggests that high cholesterol levels may promote prostate cancer development, but statin use can potentially mitigate these risks. However, it is important to note that further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms and establish a causal relationship between high cholesterol, statin use, and prostate cancer mortality rates. But several recent studies suggest that long-term use of statins may reduce the risk of the most deadly kinds of prostate cancer—advanced and metastatic disease.So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent.Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer?Observational studies in which men who don't have prostate cancer are asked about their use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs and then followed to see whether they develop prostate cancer suggest that these drugs might help prevent prostate cancer—but the benefit is likely modest and requires long-term regular use. ## Statin Drugs\n\nStatins are prescription drugs that lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke by blocking an enzyme called HMG-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase. Can they also lower the risk of prostate cancer? So far, their effect on prostate cancer, has been somewhat inconsistent. However, the association between testosterone supplementation and the development of prostate cancer is unproven. This apparent paradox can be resolved by noting that prostate cancer is very common. In autopsies, 80% of 80-year-old men have prostate cancer. Men with high-risk prostate cancer are less likely to have a recurrence when they take statin drugs commonly used to lower cholesterol levels. Michael J. Zelefsky, M.D., the senior author of the study and a radiation oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said, “In our retrospective study, we have demonstrated that statin use during radiotherapy is associated with improved biochemical tumor control among high-risk patients.\" The scientists followed the men an average of six years, finding prostate cancer was less likely to recur in the men taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs. \"Improved Biochemical Outcomes With Statin Use in Patients With High-Risk Localized Prostate Cancer Treated With Radiotherapy\"\nMarisa A.

According to a study conducted by researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the use of statin drugs during radiation treatment for high-risk prostate cancer has been associated with a lower chance of cancer recurrence. Among the participants, 23 percent were taking statins throughout their treatment. Nonetheless, the results suggest a potential benefit of statin use during radiation treatment for high-risk prostate cancer in reducing the chances of cancer recurrence.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Therefore, compounds that prevent over-activation of this receptor could be important new therapies for lessening, and even preventing, the onset of migraine attacks. GLYX-13 would raise the threshold and/or prevent SD in hippocampal brain slices. These studies confirm and extend our previous findings from males that GLYX-13 could be an excellent migraine treatment in females that could both reduce frequency of attacks and their long-term effects. There are some key unanswered questions posed by our work with immense importance to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying migraine and the search for new treatments. 1) Does slowing SD propagation and preventing generation of secondary SDs translate to fewer or less severe migraine attacks? Do they cause neuronal damage, or do they trigger neuroprotective changes? 3) Can GLYX-13 protect neurons from long-term toxicity produced by repeated SDs, as a model for repeated migraine attacks? This agent normalizes activation of this critical receptor, increasing it when it is too low, and suppressing it when it is too high. Therefore, compounds that prevent over-activation of this receptor could be important new therapies for lessening, and even preventing, the onset of migraine attacks. This is because women are three times as likely to experience migraines as men, and migraine attacks can be most severe in the days leading up to menstruation, suggesting that the drop in estrogen during normal female hormonal cycles may be an important contributor to migraine attacks. For migraine sufferers for whom none of the available treatments is effective, our discovery that the novel therapeutic GLYX-13 can also slow and even suppress the propagation of Spreading Depression in the brain offers hope for an entirely new mechanistic treatment for migraine. GLYX-13 may be useful both prophylactically and acutely to ameliorate the severity, or even abort, migraine attacks. Perhaps most importantly, in the early nineties, the drug Imitrex (generic name: sumatriptan) hit the market.Studies also began to show that migraine is, in part, inheritable, and identified a number of genes that are associated with the disorder.In the nineties, functional MRI and PET scan studies gave some clues into the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the attacks.He claimed 80 percent of his female patients were sexually dissatisfied. The migraine personality and vascular theory dominated the medical thinking from 1930 to the early 1970s. The first crack in the edifice came in the early sixties, when the FDA approved the drug methysergide as a preventive treatment for the condition. Since the drug, which affected serotonin levels, worked without changing the emotional state, let alone the personality, of the patient, it dealt a blow to the notion that migraine was psychogenic. Experts started to question the research upon which Wolff had developed the migraine personality profile to begin with. With the first population-based epidemiological studies came the conclusion that the myth of the migraine personality had emerged simply because upper-middle-class professionals were more likely to seek treatment from doctors than low-income sufferers. In the nineties, functional MRI and PET scan studies gave some clues into the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the attacks. Studies also began to show that migraine is, in part, inheritable, and identified a number of genes that are associated with the disorder. Perhaps most importantly, in the early nineties, the drug Imitrex (generic name: sumatriptan) hit the market.As Imitrex's creator explained, \"The discovery of sumatriptan confirmed, once and for all, that migraine truly is an organic disease and not just the figment of imagination of 'neurotic' patients.\" The 2016 Cochrane review evaluating acupuncture for episodic migraine prevention concluded that true acupuncture had a small effect beyond sham acupuncture and found moderate-quality evidence to suggest that acupuncture is at least similarly effective to prophylactic medications for this purpose. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine determined that carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/day, but it failed to demonstrate that the drug was sufficiently more effective than placebo in migraine prophylaxis. Research with PIR has focused almost exclusively on alleviating tension headaches and migraines. A four-year study of 100 chronic migraine sufferers found that after as few as six 30-minute training sessions, 90% of patients reported significant improvements with their migraines.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Nestlé was informed about this and responded that uranium was common in both bottled and tap water and that the 0.0070mg/l found in their product was below the 0.03 mg/l threshold established by various governments and food health organizations. A precautionary recall of Dumex’s Mamil Gold Infant Formula Stage 1 (850g) was made by the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) on Monday, 20 August 2018 after Cronobacter sakazakii bacteria was found in test samples. The bacteria found in the infant formula is called Cronobacter sakazakii. It is a foodborne bacteria and infection can lead to meningitis and septicaemia in infants. Cronobacter sakazakii is a bacterium that can live in dry conditions like powdered infant formula. High temperatures when preparing your formula for baby usually kill the bacteria but it has been known to survive preparation so there are no guarantees. While infection from the bacteria is rare, it can lead to septicaemia and/or meningitis in infants, particularly those born premature and those with compromised immune systems so it is imperative that you stay vigilant especially if your baby has had feedings from the affected batch. Follow the manufacturer.s instruction when preparing your baby’s formula. Make sure bottles are properly sterilised before making a fresh bottle of formula. Prepare infant formula with high temperatures, at least 70°C. Check for the infant formula expiry date. Throw out any unused refrigerated prepared formula within 24 hours of preparation.

Experts writing in the July issue of The New England Journal of Medicine noted that historically, pandemic viruses have evolved between seasons, and the current strain may become more severe or transmissible in the coming months. They therefore stressed the importance of international cooperation to engage in proper surveillance to help monitor changes in the virus's behavior, which will aid in both \"vaccine targeting\" and interpreting illness patterns \n\nOpinion & Analysis: Could swine flu have been prevented? \"No big decisions\" have been reached yet, WHO flu chief Keiji Fukuda told members of the press, but the organization's Director-General Margaret Chan expects to have more information next week. At the end of April, WHO raised the swine flu pandemic alert level to 5, an advisement to all countries to initiate preparedness plans for a potential \"mild pandemic.\" Get the balanced and accurate information you need from findingDulcinea’s 5 Sites for Understanding the Swine Flu (H1N1 Influenza A) Pandemic. Worrisome conclusions could be drawn. For example, the flu of 1918 appeared mild at first but later mutated, and reemerged as a deadly pandemic. Some experts say it's unlikely that swine flu will reach catastrophic levels. Peter Palese, a microbiologist and influenza expert at Mt. She suggests that swine flu is capable of becoming a pandemic because of its \"rapid evolution.\" Furthermore, MacKenzie faults researchers for not paying more attention to the threat previously. Mutations in avian flu could result in rapid spread of new epidemics, with large numbers of deaths. The World Health Organisation has warned repeatedly of the risks to global health from new mutant viruses - of which HIV, SARS virus and Bird Flu virus are just three of many examples we have seen. Just one of these is Bird Flu - caused by virus H5N1. Our world is very open to attack by Bird Flu viruses because we still have no antiviral drugs that are as effective as penicillin and other antibiotics against bacteria. And even if they were, the fact is that 3 billion people live in areas with low health budgets and poorly developed health care systems. It would be impossible to vaccinate the whole world in time, because a Bird Flu pandemic could sweep around the entire globe in a few weeks or months. The H5N1 threat to human health. Based on historical patterns, influenza pandemics can be expected to occur, on average, three to four times each century when new virus subtypes emerge and are readily transmitted from person to person. However, the occurrence of influenza pandemics is unpredictable. In the 20th century, the great influenza pandemic of 1918?1919, which caused an estimated 40 to 50 million deaths worldwide, was followed by pandemics in 1957?1958 and 1968?1969. Highly pathogenic avian influenza, such as that seen in H5N1 is characterized by sudden onset, severe illness, and rapid death, with a mortality that can approach 100%. H5N1 is of particular concern and it is widely held that H5N1 will be cause of the next human pandemic. The epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza caused by H5N1, which began in mid-December 2003 in the Republic of Korea and is now being seen in other Asian countries, is therefore of particular public health concern. Such an event would mark the start of an influenza pandemic. The current strategy is to minimize the global public health risks that could arise from large outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in birds. An immediate priority is to halt further spread of epidemics in poultry populations. This strategy works to reduce opportunities for human exposure to the virus. Hundred million people could die from flu pandemic warns WHO. Bird flu \"far deadlier than SARS\" Hong Kong (Reuters). Expert warns next flu pandemic could destroy Earth's ecosystem. December 7, 2004.\nWHO Presses Governments, Fearing Bird Flu Pandemic. Flu Pandemic Inevitable, Plans Needed Urgently ?WHO. Doctors say bird flu could overwhelm U.S. hospitals. Expert says Canada not ready for pandemic. Influenza A viruses normally seen in one species sometimes can cross over and cause severe illness in another species. The avian influenza A (H5N1) epizootic outbreak in Asia is not expected to diminish significantly in the short term. If these H5N1 viruses gain the ability for efficient and sustained transmission between humans, there is little preexisting natural immunity to H5N1 in the human population, and an influenza pandemic could result, with high rates of illness, social disruption, economic loss and death. The World Health Organization estimates that an influenza pandemic involving H5N1 will most likely result in billions of people infected and 100 million deaths. U.S. researchers are learning that people killed during the 1918 flu pandemic may not have died from the flu after all; the findings have implications for strategies against future pandemics. For example, storing antibiotics for fighting future bacterial infections could be “at least as important as stockpiling antiviral drugs to battle flu,” according to Reuters. Doing so is unethical, so the next best option health experts have is comparing illness rates among those who are vaccinated to those who are not. Exact estimates of how many people died are varied, but more recent numbers indicate that approximately 675,000 Americans were killed, and between 30 million and 50 million were affected globally. Predicting what will happen during the next flu pandemic is difficult, writes John M. Barry. The population now has more elderly people with weaker immune systems. Effects on people and the economy would be more severe than in the past. In 2008, researchers found that survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic were still producing antibodies to the virus 90 years later, according to The Washington Post. “It’s important to know that you can develop immunity to such a pandemic virus. That has implications for new pandemic viruses,\" Crowe explained. The move will trigger heightened health measures in the WHO’s 193 member states as authorities brace for the worldwide spread of the virus that has so far caused mainly mild illness. The move to phase 6 reflects the fact that the disease, widely known as swine flu, was spreading geographically, but not necessarily indicate how virulent it is. So we would think that this event is really a moderate event for the time being, because the numbers are high but the disease is overwhelmingly mild,” he told Reuters Television before the committee meeting. David Heymann, a former top WHO official now chairing Britain’s Health Protection Agency, said that countries had tried to contain the virus through measures including school closures during the previous phase 5. This has extended the precious time needed to prepare for a full-blown pandemic. “During phase 5, the government and people in the U.K. have had the time to prepare for a pandemic — this has hopefully decreased any surprise and concern that might be associated with a WHO announcement of phase 6, if one is made,” he told Reuters. “The severity of that disease, the effectiveness of antiviral drugs and the stability of the virus must all be watched closely,” he added. As the death toll climbs, the World Health Organization is set to declare a swine flu pandemic, a move that could prompt fast-track production of preventive vaccines. The declaration of a global epidemic was expected Thursday as WHO officials huddled in an emergency session in Geneva in the wake of 141 swine flu deaths worldwide, including 12 in New York City. If WHO moves from level 5 to level 6 on its pandemic alert scale, it would be the first flu pandemic declared since the Hong Kong flu killed an estimated 1 million people in 1968. On Wednesday, WHO reported 27,737 cases worldwide, most of them mild and requiring no treatment. WHO chief Dr. Margaret Chan says she believes a pandemic is under way, but was seeking proof that the H1N1 strain is spreading rapidly from person to person outside the Americas before declaring a global epidemic. The Health Department estimated that more than 500,000 city residents may have been sickened by the virus. Ordinary flu kills about 250,000 to 500,000 people each year. Without vaccines, the H1N1 flu strain could return to the northern hemisphere in a far more virulent form in winter, cause widespread sickness and death, mass work absences, and major disruption to trade, some experts fear. The World Bank estimated last year that a serious pandemic could cost $3 trillion and cut global gross domestic product by nearly 5%. The A(H1N1) virus behind the swine flu outbreak pales in comparison with fearsome pathogens that kill millions of people worldwide each year, experts said. In comparison, the A(H1N1) virus has infected 1,085 people and killed 26 worldwide in the past 10 days, the WHO said. The number of cases and deaths attributed to A(H1N1) remains low compared to those registered every year as a result of seasonal flu, the physician said, noting the moderate virulence of the virus. Linda Lingle says the World Health Organization is considering raising the pandemic alert level to phase 6, the highest level indicating a global outbreak of the swine flu. She says it is not an indication that the outbreak is more severe, or more people are getting sick or dying. Imposing a level 6 would give governments around the world a perfect excuse to impose martial law, even though many scientists believe the H1N1 virus is no more of a threat than seasonal flu. “If it becomes a pandemic, you could lose some simple rights — like going to the movies,” said host Steve Doocy, who completely understated the issue.

According to recent research presented in the American College of Cardiology's 68th Annual Scientific Session, this practice is not followed in the current cancer treatment strategies. \"This is essentially free information because the patients are undergoing the CT scans anyway, and we'd like to see it reported more frequently,\" said Matthew Hooks, MD, a resident physician at the University of Minnesota and the study's lead author. \"It would be particularly helpful to know if a patient has evidence of early coronary artery disease before starting cancer treatment that can potentially harm the heart.\" In a sample of 1,001 patients undergoing treatment for cancer, the researchers examined how often CAC was reported and how often patients with CAC were prescribed aspirin or statins to reduce cardiovascular risk. All the patients included in the study underwent a CT scan before starting treatment with an anthracycline drug or trastuzumab, two cancer treatments known to increase the risk of heart problems. Since mammograms are performed far more frequently than coronary angiograms, the findings suggest including breast arterial calcification in mammogram reports could help doctors identify women at risk of having coronary artery disease and intervene early, said Rajendra Patel, MD, lead author of the study conducted at Navicent Health/Mercer University School of Medicine. Therefore, it's about 60% likely that you will have some coronary calcification but until the score is determined, the overall predictive significance is nothing more than guesswork. Can the abnormal coronary calcium score be treated? However, a study of 1,005 patients with an abnormal coronary calcium score were treated with aspirin and some with a statin to lower their cholesterol. After four years of treatment, follow-up patients who received a statin had a 7% rate of heart events, such as a heart attack, versus 12% of those which received a placebo. There need to be more studies geared towards determining how the risk can be lowered by specific treatments; however, this study gives a glimpse of the power of finding and treating silent heart disease an early stage. The American College of Cardiology, of which I am a member and Fellow, took a big step forward in 2011 when they commented on coronary calcium CT scans. They released new guidelines for assessment of CV risk in asymptomatic adults. The visit will take about 4 hours to complete and no follow-up visits are required. - Participants will fill out a short medical questionnaire asking routine information (treatment history, previous surgeries, medications, allergies, etc.) - Five minutes after the injection, blood pressure and heart rate will be checked again. - Participants will then be free to leave the functional imaging department for a period of 180 minutes while the 18F-EF5 circulates throughout their body. The participant will need to lie still on the scanner bed during the entire scan. - Unable to tolerate a PET scan which involves an injection of radiopharmaceutical and lying flat and still for 30 minutes. - Weight more than 204.5 kg (Physical Limitation of Imaging and Radiotherapy Couches) or cannot fit through the PET/CT machine (diameter 70cm). The UK HeartSpare Study (Stage II): Multicentre Evaluation of a Voluntary Breath-hold Technique in Patients Receiving Breast Radiotherapy. Following surgery for early left breast cancer, patients with any heart inside the 50% isodose from a standard free-breathing tangential field treatment plan underwent a second planning computed tomography (CT) scan using the VBH technique. A separate treatment plan was prepared on the VBH CT scan and used for treatment. The mean heart, left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) and lung doses were calculated. Daily electronic portal imaging (EPI) was carried out and scanning/treatment times were recorded. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving a reduction in mean heart dose with VBH. Within-patient comparisons between techniques used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Median CT and treatment session times were 21 and 22 min, respectively.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

When applied to rum-running, drug smuggling, and blockade running the more potent products become the sole focus of the \n\n According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, as of 2015–2016, 19.5% of Washington adults aged 18 or older have used cannabis within the past year, relative to the national average, which was estimated at 13.9% by the same survey. Like other drug abuse problems, marijuana dependency needs to be addressed from a psychological, clinical and social prospective. Marijuana use disorder responds extremely well to both Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as well as Motivational Enhancement Therapy. It is quite common for someone who is misusing marijuana to have undiagnosed or untreated depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD or ADHD. When this is the case, the person might be using marijuana to self-medicate in order to feel relief and appropriate therapies will be utilized for successful treatment. If you, or someone that you care about, is currently struggling with an addiction or dependence to marijuana, it’s important to assess if marijuana use is negatively affecting normal, daily life. Many times people think they’re fine and marijuana is harmless, but a deeper look may show otherwise. While there has been much debate in recent years about whether marijuana is actually addictive, the majority of studies show that frequent marijuana use over the long-term can lead to physical and psychological dependency. While marijuana may not be as addictive as cocaine, heroin, or crystal meth, long-term use can lead to a dependency to the drug, that affects almost 15% of all regular marijuana users. It is estimated that marijuana accounts for nearly 4.5 million of the estimated 7.2 million Americans dependent on or abusing illicit drugs. Marijuana addiction is also linked to mild withdrawal symptoms, that can be similar to nicotine withdrawal symptoms when people quit smoking cigarettes. While many like to claim that smoking marijuana is practically harmless and it has no serious long-term side effects, this is factually not accurate. While marijuana may not be as dangerous as crystal meth, cocaine, or heroin, it does come with a number of short-term and long-term health effects that potential users need to be aware of. Marijuana can potentially impair the brain’s short-term memory function, making it more difficult to learn and retain information, as well as manage simple everyday tasks. Marijuana has also been shown to increase heart rate by as much as 40 percent, and can increase the risk of heart attack, especially in individuals already suffering from existing heart disease. Studies show that of the adults seeking treatment for marijuana abuse, most have used marijuana daily for at least 10 years and have attempted to quit on their own six times. Marijuana dependence is highest among people with other psychiatric conditions, such as depression, bipolar, anxiety or panic disorder. Long-term marijuana use can produce physical, mental, emotional and behavioral issues. Often a very slow gradual process, the compulsion to smoke marijuana becomes the most important focal point of that person’s life. In 2012, more than 31 million Americans aged 13 or older reported using marijuana at least once over the past year. While marijuana use, especially among teens, was on a consistent decline for much of the 1990s, and into the early 2000s, this trend has completely reversed in recent years showing a significant increase in marijuana use across all age groups. So what is the reason behind this recent spike in marijuana use and is it really as dangerous as many experts say? According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse’s “2015 Monitoring the Future Survey,” more high school seniors now smoke marijuana on a daily basis than cigarettes. Today’s new strains and ways to ingest marijuana are far more potent than in previous years. Twenty or 30 years ago, THC levels were below 10 percent, making today’s number extremely potent and increasing its addictive properties. According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, long-term marijuana users who try to quit can experience significant withdrawal symptoms, irritability, sleeplessness, anxiety and drug cravings. If you, or someone you care about is currently struggling with a dependence to marijuana, it’s important to consider treatment as a viable recovery option. For anyone struggling with marijuana dependence, addiction, or misuse, it’s important to know that help is available and treatment does work.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

He resigned and fled to Brussels, Belgium on June 28, 2015 during the 2015–2018 Burundian unrest, citing the unrest and his opposition to president Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a disputed third term in the 2015 Burundian presidential election. He told France 24 that he \"personally advised President Nkurunziza to drop his plan for a third term, but his answer was to threaten me, to humiliate me.\" Burundian experts travel to Kenya to learn about harm reduction from one of Africa's pioneers. Led by Burundian non-profit, Jeunesse au Clair Medical (JCM), the team of physicians and health advocates are pushing for a comprehensive package of harm reduction interventions in Burundi. At a visit to the Mombasa Inspectorate in charge of drug-related offences, the team learnt first-hand from the Chief Inspector the importance of police engagement, highlighting the negative impact drug use can have on young lives and the need for strategies that work. The team from Burundi also saw in practice how the Kenyan clinics functioned and how methadone is dispensed. To protest the 1996 coup by President Pierre Buyoya, neighboring countries imposed an economic embargo on Burundi. Although the embargo was never officially ratified by the United Nations Security Council, most countries refrained from official trade with Burundi. Following the coup, the United States also suspended all but humanitarian aid to Burundi.

A vote in the Parliament of Burundi made the change official on 16 January 2019, with all branches of government expected to move to Gitega within three years. During Bagaza's presidency, there were long-standing tensions over the repression of the Roman Catholic Church, in a country where 65% of citizens are practising Catholics.

A new study reports on the impact of ivermectin on skeeters. The female Anopheles mosquito is a spreader of malaria. That may sound too good to be true, but it's a tantalizing possibility, according to research published this week in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. Studies conducted in the 2000s, including one in 2010, show that malaria-carrying mosquitoes die after feeding on individuals who have ingested the drug. Malaria is a mosquito-borne infection that affects more than 200 million people worldwide. The disease is transmitted when an infected mosquito bites an individual, spreading a parasite called plasmodium. In humans, the parasite can cause fever, headache, chills and even death. Despite years of eradication efforts in developing countries, growing research shows malaria-carrying mosquitoes are becoming resistant to the insecticides meant to wipe them out. \"Since 2015, the number of annual deaths from malaria has stabilized,\" says Menno Smit, MD, a Ph.D. candidate at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine who led the new study. Ivermectin was developed in the early 1980s as a drug to fight parasites that cause river blindness and elephantiasis. Smit and his colleagues hope it can also help eradicate malaria. \"The most exciting result was the fact that even one month after [the subjects took] ivermectin, their blood was still killing mosquitoes,\" Smit says. Blood samples were obtained from these participants six times and then fed to mosquitoes in cages. \"We put the blood in an artificial membrane that mosquitoes could bite on and then watched,\" Smit explains. Two weeks after feeding, 97 percent of the mosquitoes had died. Participants reported few side effects, though he admits everyone in the study was already hospitalized and receiving treatment for malaria. Dr. Peter Hotez, who was not involved in the study and is dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine, says bigger studies need to be done before ivermectin is seriously considered as part of a national malaria control program. Hotez warns that, though ivermectin is an exciting possibility, there is the potential for mosquitoes to build drug resistance. In a separate commentary on the study, Rabinovich writes that \"more than one approach will probably be needed to confront this challenge [of malaria].\" Perhaps new drugs that have a similar effect on mosquitoes can be developed that have a longer lasting effect, she says. In an email to NPR, she stresses the need for trials in an area where malaria is rampant — and reminds people that researchers need to make sure that by killing mosquitoes, ivermectin can also decrease transmission, too. Editor's note: The original version of this post wrote that ivermectin is used to treat the disease \"elephantitis.\" Several readers noted that a more commonly used term for this condition is \"elephantiasis.\" a salmon-crested cockatoo named \"King Tut\" from the Maluku Islands. The bird was sold to a La Mesa, California couple who shared it with the Zoo. King Tut went on to appear in several films, television shows, and theater productions, and was the \"official greeter\" of the Zoo for decades, sitting on a perch inside the entrance to squawk at guests  Following King Tut's death in 1990, a bronze statue of the cockatoo was placed in the location of its longtime perch and remains there today, its plaque indicating that the bird \"was brought from Indonesia in 1925 by Frank Buck\". How Malaria In The Brain Kills: Doctors Solve A Medical Mystery : Goats and Soda A child stricken with the deadliest form of the disease can quickly fall unconscious and die. Dr. Terrie Taylor, left, and Dr. Karl Seydel take a child's vitals in the malaria ward at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Malaria is one of the oldest scourges of mankind. Most of the time malaria causes a bad fever and body aches. The effects of malaria in the brain are clear: A healthy brain, right, has many grooves and crevices. Since 1986, Taylor has been treating children with severe malaria at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Seeing so many families deal with these huge losses, year after year, made Taylor focus her career on one goal: Figuring out why some children die from cerebral malaria but others soon recover. To do this, she realized that she needed to look inside the brain of a child suffering with malaria. When malaria goes into the brain, it can quickly kill a child. At the time, researchers knew cerebral malaria could do this. But what they didn't know was how that swelling caused death. \"This type of experiment is very, very hard to do in any country in sub-Saharan Africa.\" John, who studies malaria in Uganda, says he's never dreamed having an MRI at the malaria ward. He says Taylor's findings are important because they point to potential therapies or interventions to test. Many clinics in Africa don't have ventilators or physicians trained to use them, John says. And if a malaria ward in Malawi can get a million-dollar MRI machine, surely somebody could donate life-saving ventilators. did not give up, and instead formed a more elaborate argument which he published as a 15-page article in the September 1883 issue of The Popular Science Monthly, making an introduction as: \"I now propose to present a series of facts... with regard to the so-called “malarial poison,” and to show how they may be explicable by the supposition that the mosquito is the real source of the disease, rather than the inhalation or cutaneous of a marsh-vapor.\" To paraphrase his lengthy arguments: occurrence of malaria always coincided with conditions that are also ideal for mosquitos, such as in the time of day, geographical area, temperature, and climate. But the flaw in his proposition was that he believed malaria was transmitted by mosquito through its eggs. In 2012, Dr Hutan Ashrafian, a surgeon at Imperial College London, hypothesized that early deaths of Thutmose IV and other 18th Dynasty pharaohs, including Akhenaten and Tutankhamun, were likely a result of familial temporal epilepsy. This would account for the untimely demise of Thutmose IV and could also explain his religious vision described on the Dream Stele as this type of epilepsy is associated with intense spiritual visions and religiosity.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The types of treatment that can be covered under EPSDT are broad and can address a range of concerns including physical and mental health, hearing and vision, dental health, immunizations, and more. In this same year and in preparation for offering this benefit on a statewide basis, the State of New Jersey began providing Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) services to some Medicaid-eligible children via the New Jersey Comprehensive Waiver, a Section 1115 research and demonstration waiver under the Social Security Act. These waiver services are administered by the New Jersey Department of Children and Families Children’s System of Care (CSOC) under what is commonly referred to as the “ASD Pilot.” The scope of the waiver has been limited to approximately 200 children who have been assessed to have an acute level of need, e.g., severe challenging behaviors such as property destruction, aggression and injury to self or others, and elopement. How will the State of New Jersey Cover Treatment for Autism Beyond the Pilot Under Medicaid/EPSDT? Since CMS issued its initial guidance in 2014, we’ve been engaged on a statewide level to encourage expansion of the pilot to all Medicaid-eligible children. Texans deserve to expect this holistic understanding applied to all their health care, not just for the treatment of major physical illness. Whether a mental health need such as depression is triggered by a medical condition, or a chronic illness such as diabetes develops due to a medication side effect or difficulty accessing primary care because of the symptoms of a mental illness, Texans can never be as healthy as they can be until our medical delivery systems begin to address the whole person. Beginning in 2005, multiple studies have correlated high levels of comorbidity and high levels of premature mortality among the severely mentally ill.\nTexans with severe mental illness die by age 49.5 on average; the national average for this population is age 56. The health cost per person with severe mental illness is 3 to 10 times higher, costing billions of dollars annually. Under the Texas 1115 Medicaid Demonstration Waiver, there are 139 behavioral health DSRIP (Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment) projects dedicated to co-occurring behavior health (BH) and primary health (PH). Representing approximately one-third of all the behavioral health DSRIP projects and more than $200 million a year in Medicaid spending, these pilot programs are projected to serve more than 200,000 individuals a year by the end of the Waiver period in 2016. While sustaining these programs after the waiver period ends in 2016 will be a challenge, they have helped catapult Texas delivery systems forward in terms of integrated capacity development. The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute is funding a study by Texas A&M University to look at ten of the 139 DSRIP BH/PH projects in more depth to see what is successful, with particular emphasis on adults with serious mental illness with high rates of comorbid diseases (and related mortality). The Texas Department of State Health Services spends $1.16 billion a year on mental health and Medicaid spends at least $1.2 billion a year (and potentially over $2 billion annually). The 1115 Waiver is funding over $500 million a year in behavioral DSRIP projects, representing a significant part of Texas’ mental health budget, funding which may be lost if the waiver is not renewed in 2016. However, studies suggest that the medical costs associated with mental illness are many times higher, impacting both the state Medicaid program and local hospital districts and inpatient providers serving people without insurance. To ensure access to treatment before tragedy, we need a minimum standard of availability and knowledge of effective and efficient practices in every Texas community. The Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that supports the implementation of policies and programs that help Texans obtain effective, efficient mental health care when and where they need it. The Institute's vision is for Texas to be the national leader in treating people with mental health needs.

Superficially, Geron is more valuable having full rights to imetelstat than sharing them with Johnson & Johnson, but the healthcare conglomerate handing back the drug is a sign that imetelstat might not be quite as valuable as Geron's investors believed it was. Johnson & Johnson has also submitted data from the IMbark study in patients with myelofibrosis, although Geron is still trying to decide whether to pursue advancing imetelstat into a phase 3 trial in that bone marrow disorder. Geron's main focus in the biomedical industry after transitioning away from stem-cell therapy is now on the development of a modified nucleic acid called imetelstat to treat cancer and blood disorders. Geron will still be responsible for moving imetelstat forward and will share development costs with Janssen for upcoming Phase 2 trials in myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndrome. Geron's transition away from stem-cell therapy and focus on imetelstat has been met with positive market response, with Geron shares increasing by more than 30 percent. Imetelstat was initially licensed to Janssen Biotech but is now back with Geron and is currently in Phase 3 trials for its ability to reduce the transfusion requirements in patients. [Reference Text: Geron Corporation is a biotechnology company located in Foster City, California, which specializes in developing and commercializing therapeutic products for cancer that inhibit telomerase.] to Geron. Geron's progress with telomerase vaccines attracted a modest monetary investment in 2005 from Merck. Geron Corporation has sponsored human clinical trials of several potential anti-cancer products. Geron shares soar after the FDA gives the company some \"partially\" positive news. What: Shares of Geron (NASDAQ:GERN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapies to treat hematologic malignancies, skyrocketed as much as 33% after announcing that the Food and Drug Administration had removed the partial clinical hold on imetelstat in its myelofibrosis investigator-sponsored trial. So what: As a refresher, the partial clinical hold was put in place by the FDA in March due to concerns of imetelstat-driven liver damage. However, Geron notes that the FDA still has a full clinical hold in place for its polycythemia vera and multiple myeloma indications. Now what: I'm not too shocked with today's press release as imetelstat had delivered meaningful clinical responses in its myelofibrosis investigator-sponsored trial which likely merited further research. However, we have to consider that imetelstat is Geron's only clinical compound, so if it continues to experience safety issues, is unable to get its full clinical hold removed for its two additional indications, or it simply fails to meet its primary endpoint in trials, then Geron's share price is likely going to be crushed.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

At least a third of people who are infected do not develop noticeable symptoms. Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be classed as patients, most \n\n  The SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect a wide range of cells and systems of the body. The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the receptor for the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant on the surface of type II alveolar cells of the lungs. It is common to have watery eyes, runny nose, and sometimes, a headache when you have the common cold. However, these symptoms can be due other health problems as well. If you think your symptoms are unrelated to a common cold, this article will help you determine what the symptoms are caused by. The most common symptoms of a common cold are watery eyes, runny nose and sometimes, chest congestion. If you have these symptoms, they are most likely to be due to the common cold. The common cold is simply a viral infection that has taken up residence in the upper respiratory tract, mainly in the throat and nose. The main symptoms besides watery eyes runny nose are itchy throat, sore throat, congestion, cough, mild headache, sneezing, body aches, fatigue, and a low grade fever. Hay fever is usually also called allergic rhinitis. The symptoms are similar to that of a common cold. Besides the watery eyes, runny nose, and congestion, you may have itching of the eyes and nose, as well as sneezing. It is also common to have a \"sinus headache\" and blocked ears. You can also get other symptoms, such as headache, jaw and teeth pain, pain in the ears, tiredness, fever, and bad breath, also known as halitosis. If the conjunctivitis is from allergies, watery eyes and runny nose are often seen along with the above symptoms. A drug allergy is more common with some medications than with others. The most common drug allergy symptoms include watery eyes, runny nose, rash, itching, fever, hives, shortness of breath, swelling of the body, wheezing and itchy eyes. It is rare to have anaphylaxis when taking a drug, but it can happen in some cases. There are some diseases and illnesses that can lead to these symptoms. These include having respiratory syncytial virus, whooping cough, narcotic abuse, and nasal polyps. Fortunately, there are home remedies you can consider that will attack the symptoms of watery eyes runny nose, congestion in the nose, cough, and sneezing. You can use steam in order to let the nose run clear. This will loosen the mucus and help your nose drain. You can use nasal sprays or drops made from salt water. Allergens in your living space, such as dust mites, pollen, mold, and pet dander can cause watery eyes runny nose and nasal congestion. Following viral entry, COVID-19 infects the ciliated epithelium of the nasopharynx and upper airways. Some of the symptoms that COVID-19 patients could experience is shortness of breath (which might be a sign of pneumonia), cough, fever, and diarrhea.

For the study, Casadei and her colleagues randomly assigned more than 1,900 patients who were having elective heart surgery to take Crestor or a placebo before surgery. The researchers found that patients given Crestor had lower levels of cholesterol and C-reactive protein (another marker for heart trouble) after surgery, compared with patients given a placebo. And further analyses showed that Crestor was associated with a 5.4 percent greater chance of mild kidney damage, when compared with a placebo. \"The risk of kidney injury is relatively small, but considering that the benefit of statin treatment before a heart operation is zero, one may well consider stopping statins for a few days before surgery,\" Casadei said. The report was published May 5 in the New England Journal of Medicine. \"Current guidelines recommend that all patients with cardiovascular disease, including patients after coronary artery bypass surgery, receive statins to lower the risk of fatal and nonfatal heart attacks and strokes,\" he said. Beyond the intermediate and long-term benefits of statins, a number of small clinical trials have suggested an additional short-term benefit of starting or continuing statin therapy before heart surgery. In the late 1990s it introduced a statin drug, Baycol (cerivastatin), but after 52 deaths were attributed to it, Bayer discontinued it in 2001. Withholding the antihypertensive medications (ARBs, ACEIs), diuretic medications, and NSAIDs before and after the use of OSP for colonoscopy, is reported to minimize the risk of phosphate nephropathy. Statins (prescription drugs to lower cholesterol) are considered a small risk. They found patients taking high potency statins had a 34 per cent higher risk of being hospitalised for acute kidney injury, compared with those taking low doses. Those in the high-risk group were taking 40 milligram and higher statin pills. The health records of two million people were used from the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies for those with and without chronic kidney disease. High potency statin users were 34 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for acute kidney injury (AKI) compared with low potency statin users in the first 120 days of treatment. This risk seemed to remain elevated for two years after starting treatment. The researchers estimate that 1,700 patients with no previous kidney problems need to be treated with a high potency statin instead of a low potency statin in order to cause one additional hospitalisation. But the risk could have been ‘underestimated’ they say in a report in the online medical journal bmj.com. The researchers conclude that prescribing high potency statins is ‘associated with an increased rate of hospital admission with AKI compared with lower potency statins’. The risk of type 2 diabetes is raised by 12 per cent with high dose statins compared with moderate doses, according to a study. Lead researcher Professor Colin Dormuth, of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, said further investigation was necessary to determine how statins might be causing kidney injury. It could be due to the increased risk of rhabdomyolysis, or because use of statins can deplete the body's stores of CoQ10, a naturally-occurring nutrient important for energy production in cells. Some studies suggest statins may protect against health problems, including blood clots, Alzheimer's and eye disorders, by maintaining a healthy supply of blood to the brain. They may also cut the risk of dying from pneumonia.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Dogs swimming in lakes affected by blue-green algae have died. In Spain, greater flamingo chicks died in a marsh lagoon in Donana National Park when a dense bloom of cyanobacteria occurred in 2001. In such cases, cobalt should be given as well as anthelmintics. Some cyanobacteria can produce neurotoxins, cytotoxins, endotoxins, and hepatotoxins (e.g., the microcystin-producing bacteria genus microcystis), which are collectively known as cyanotoxins. Specific toxins include anatoxin-a, guanitoxin, aplysiatoxin, cyanopeptolin, cylindrospermopsin, domoic acid, nodularin R (from Nodularia), neosaxitoxin, and saxitoxin. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in algal blooms which can become harmful to other species and pose a danger to humans and animals if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins.

On 13 March 2020, the Guatemalan government extended its travel restrictions to travelers from the US and Canada. On 15 March 2020, the Guatemalan government confirmed its second case and the first COVID-19 death in the country. On March 21, 2020, the Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei alongside its vice-president and the Council Of Ministry declared a nationwide curfew and a global travel ban, in an effort to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and prevent the spreading of the virus.

In nearly 600 patients age 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussion with up to 97 percent accuracy, the researchers said. \"Not only were they present in the bloodstream, we were able to detect measurable levels of GFAP up to a week after the injury,\" said Papa, a U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded researcher. An estimated 250,000 U.S. children are treated in hospitals each year for concussions from playing sports -- nearly 700 a day. \"We have so many diagnostic blood tests for different parts of the body, like the heart, liver and kidneys, but there's never been a reliable blood test to identify trauma in the brain. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. Blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examination by lumbar puncture (also known as spinal tap), brain imaging studies, electroencephalography (EEG), neuropsychological testing and similar diagnostic studies may be used to differentiate the various causes of encephalopathy. The potential significance of the blood test in diagnosing concussions, especially in patients who do not immediately show symptoms, is that it provides a new way to accurately diagnose concussions, particularly in children, and ensure that they receive proper treatment. The blood test looks for a biomarker called glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which is released into the bloodstream when the brain is injured. In a study with nearly 600 patients aged 18 and older, the blood test detected mild to moderate concussions with up to 97 percent accuracy. This is particularly beneficial for patients who do not immediately show symptoms of a concussion. Additionally, the blood test could help identify patients who require neurosurgery and potentially reduce the use of costly and radiation-exposing CT scans in diagnosing concussions. It's important to note that while the research into this blood test is promising, it is still preliminary, and the test would not be ready for widespread use for several years.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Wild mammals like raccoons, skunks, foxes, coyotes or bats can have and transmit rabies. Domestic animals like dogs, cats, horses and cattle also can transmit rabies to humans. However, domestic animals account for fewer than 10 percent of all reported rabies cases in animals. Report all animal bites and other injuries to humans caused by animals to your local health department. The local health department environmentalist may recommend a 10-day quarantine for dogs, cats or ferrets, but for wild animals, immediate rabies testing will be necessary. Confine your pet or otherwise make sure it does not run away. Any animal bitten by either a bat or wild mammal (in Kentucky usually skunks, foxes or raccoons) that is not available for rabies testing should be regarded as having been exposed to rabies. No cases of rabies among ferrets were confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1998-99. Still, it is important to vaccinate your pets. Unvaccinated dogs, cats, or ferrets exposed to a rabid animal should be euthanized immediately. If the owner is unwilling to do this, the animal must be placed in strict isolation for six months and vaccinated one month before being released. Dogs, cats and ferrets with current rabies vaccinations given by a licensed veterinarian should be revaccinated immediately and kept under observation for 45 days. Animals with expired vaccinations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Bats accounted for six of the 35 confirmed cases of rabies in Kentucky in 1999. Contact your veterinarian or local animal control personnel for information. Your local health department has proper containers and instructions for submitting an animal specimen for rabies testing. Most fatalities from rabies occur when people fail to seek prompt medical assistance or are unaware of the exposure, as with some of the cases associated with bat rabies. Many countries have a much higher risk of rabies exposure than the United States. In 1998, four cases of rabies in horses were confirmed in Kentucky. Proper and up-to-date vaccination of your pets is your first line of defense against rabies. ** In the United States, rabies is found in terrestrial animals in 10 distinct geographic areas. **FIGURE 17–2.Since 1977, raccoon rabies has spread from West Virginia and Virginia to 12 northeastern states.The hunters are believed to have imported infected raccoons from another state.Before that time, the nearest cases of raccoon rabies were found several hundred miles away in South Carolina.G protein binds to the acetylcholine or NCAM receptor on target cells\n\nNegative sense RNA virus replicates in the cytoplasm\n\nG protein-containing lipoprotein envelope acquired from plasma membrane\n\n  RABIES\n\n**CLINICAL CAPSULE**\n\nRabies involves the development of severe neurologic symptoms and signs in a patient who was previously bitten by an animal. The urban form is associated with unimmunized dogs or cats, and the sylvatic form occurs in wild skunks, foxes, wolves, raccoons, and bats, but not rodents or rabbits. For example, raccoon hunters apparently are to blame for the sudden appearance of raccoon rabies in West Virginia and Virginia in 1977. Before that time, the nearest cases of raccoon rabies were found several hundred miles away in South Carolina. The hunters are believed to have imported infected raccoons from another state. Since 1977, raccoon rabies has spread from West Virginia and Virginia to 12 northeastern states. ** In the United States, rabies is found in terrestrial animals in 10 distinct geographic areas.Two epizootic forms of rabies: urban (unimmunized dogs and cats) and sylvatic (wild bats, foxes, raccoons, skunks, wolves)\n\nHuman infection, or the much more common infection of cattle, is incidental, is blind ended, and does not contribute to maintenance or transmission of the disease.In the United States, more than 75% of reported cases of rabies in animals occur among wildlife. Both were skeptical of it being a hoax as the operators were well familiar with wildlife and cited the over 100 °F weather, high humidity, and rural location would make a hoax unfeasible. One of the first pictures of the alleged Skunk ape was photographed days later by then Ochopee Fire Control District Chief, Vince Doerr. After sighting the creature moving across a road, Doerr stopped his car and observed it walking off into the cypresses. Unvaccinated ferrets suspected of having rabies should be euthanized and submitted for laboratory testing. The diagnosis of rabies can only be performed after necropsy 7]. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) advises on the most current methodology of rabies testing, and more information can be found at <http://www.cdc.gov/rabies>. The main sources of rabies infection in humans and animals include animal bites, particularly from infected mammals such as dogs, bats, coyotes, foxes, raccoons, skunks, and wolves. In the United States, despite a decrease in cases, bat exposure has been the source of almost all reported cases in recent years, even though there has been a resurgence of rabies in skunks and raccoons.

Harvesting 66% of the total population per year is required to keep the Texas feral pig populations stable. Best management practices suggest the use of corral traps which have the ability to capture the entire sounder of feral pigs. The federal government spends $20 million on feral pig management. In February 2017, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller approved the use of a pesticide called Kaput Feral Hog Lure, which is bait food laced with warfarin (a rodenticide used to kill rodents). How could contaminants in such infinitesimal amounts possibly cause such damage? \"...a rapidly fatal putrid infection, even if the putrid matter is introduced directly into the blood, requires more than homeopathic doses of the poison.

However, women who take Actos for type 2 diabetes not only are at risk for bladder cancer but are also at risk for fractures known as secondary osteoporosis. Type 2 diabetes is manageable with a complementary prescription drug and nutrition. At the School of Medicine, Health Policy and Practice, University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, their study aimed to determine the risk of fractures associated with thiazolidinedione therapy and to evaluate the effect on bone density. Interpretation: Long-term thiazolidinedione use doubles the risk of fractures among women with type 2 diabetes, without a significant increase in risk of fractures among men with type 2 diabetes. In yet another study, there was evidence that both the TZD class of drugs causes bone loss and increase fracture risk, specifically in women. Improvement of bone safety of TZD-based therapy may be achieved by using combination therapy with other anti-diabetic therapies, or preventing bone loss by using available anti-osteoporotic drugs, or development of a new class of selective TZDs, which may have sparing or even beneficial effects on skeleton. Women beware of Actos, bladder cancer, and bone fractures. **ACTOS IS ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, TOO**\n\nWhether or not there was also a fracture problem with Actos was answered by the manufacturer's analysis of its clinical trial database of more than fifteen thousand patients. Women, but not men, receiving Actos (pioglitazone) had a higher number of fractures. Increased fracture risk observed in women is now included in the Actos prescribing information under _Precautions._ The full prescribing label includes additional information about fractures that was gathered during the PROACTIVE study (Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events). Over an almost-three-year period, women with type 2 diabetes taking Actos had double the number of fractures compared to women on placebo. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself? One large British study suggested that older men and women are both at increased fracture risk as a result of taking TZDs. Although the FDA warnings and precautions for TZDs and fracture include only women, women _and_ men with low bone mass and higher risk of fracture may want to use another type of diabetes medicine for control of their blood sugars. The authors of the same analysis recommended that other blood sugar lowering agents be considered in people with other risk factors for bladder cancer such as cigarette smoking, family history, or exposure to certain forms of chemotherapy. Thiazolidinediones reduce bone mineral density and increase the risk of fractures in women, possibly as a result of biasing the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells away from osteoblast differentiation and toward adipocyte formation. ›Bill Gottlieb, CHC, a health coach certified by the American Association of Drugless Practitioners.Example #2: Pioglitazone can triple the risk for eye problems and vision loss, double the risk for bone fractures in women, and double the risk for bladder cancer. Doctors typically try to control high blood sugar with a glucose-lowering medication such as metformin, a drug most experts consider safe. But other diabetes drugs may not be safe. Example #1: Recent studies show that sitagliptin and exenatide double the risk for hospitalization for pancreatitis (inflamed pancreas) and triple the risk for pancreatic cancer. Example #2: Pioglitazone can triple the risk for eye problems and vision loss, double the risk for bone fractures in women, and double the risk for bladder cancer. Over a longer term and with aging, would use of TZDs add additional risk on top of the increased risk from the diabetes itself?However, the study period for the clinical trials using TZD drugs was short—four years or less. **MEN, TOO?The female subjects were in their midfifties and had been diagnosed with diabetes for two years or less.

Fluorescent lamps with magnetic ballasts flicker at a normally unnoticeable frequency of 100 or 120 Hz (twice of the utility frequency; the lamp is lit on both the positive and negative half-wave of a cycle). This flickering can cause problems for some individuals with light sensitivity and are associated with headaches and eyestrain. Such lamps are listed as problematic for some individuals with autism, epilepsy, lupus, chronic fatigue syndrome, Lyme disease, and vertigo. Ordinary people have better reading performance using frequency (50–60 Hz) electromagnetic ballasts than electronic ballasts, although the effect was large only for the case of luminance contrast. Early studies suspected a relationship between the flickering of fluorescent lamps with electromagnetic ballasts and repetitive movement in autistic children. The Health Protection Agency of the United Kingdom has conducted research concluding that exposure to open (single envelope) compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) for over 1 hour per day at a distance of less than 30 cm can exceed guideline levels as recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In 2009, Natural Resources Canada released a report describing the possible UV exposure from several types of lamps. The report observes that such a close distance is unlikely in actual use. At 30 cm distance, the recommended maximum daily exposure was attained between 3 hours and 6 hours, with little difference between the studied 60 watt incandescent lamp and any bare-spiral CFL. SCENIHR study and report\nThe Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR) in 2008 reviewed the connections between artificial light and numerous human diseases, including:\nUltraviolet radiation emitted by fluorescent lighting can increase an individual's exposure to carcinogenic radiation by 10 to 30 per cent per year, with an associated increased probability of contracting squamous cell carcinoma by 4 percent. The constituent high-energy visible light (some blue light) of CFLs can aggravate retinal diseases in susceptible people, but it is unlikely to occur. The report states that \"people with autism or Asperger's syndrome have reported problems which they attributed to fluorescent lighting and any deleterious effects on sufferers of autism or Asperger Syndrome from CFLs cannot be dismissed. The inner-ear condition Ménière's disease can be aggravated by flicker. Sufferers of vertigo are recommended to not use fluorescent lights. Artificial light sources may provoke the condition, and CFLs have been shown to produce an eruption. There is evidence that CFLs worsen the condition. The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleaned up. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer.

The autoimmune disease lupus is exacerbated by CFLs. There is evidence that actinic prurigo is worsened by CFLs. Some patients are directly affected by CFLs. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are at additional risk of adverse photosensitive reactions caused by CFLs. Self-reporting suggests that 21% of chronic fatigue syndrome patients experience sensitivity to light but there have been no studies into the association between chronic fatigue syndrome and CFLs. Provided the level of UV emission from lamps is within safe limits, and the lamp a sufficient distance away from the individual, there should be no increased risk of developing cataracts. There is evidence that flicker can cause seizures in patients with photosensitive epilepsy, but there has yet to be any evidence to date attributing seizures to compact fluorescent lamps. Self-reporting suggests fluorescent lamps aggravate dyslexia, but tests show that dyslexic patients are unable to detect flicker emanating from light sources. Mercury\nFluorescent bulbs contain mercury, a toxic substance. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provide safety guidelines for how to clean up a broken fluorescent bulb. Mercury can be harmful to children and developing fetuses, so children and pregnant women should avoid being in the area whilst a broken bulb is cleaned up. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the amount of mercury contained in a compact fluorescent lamp (about 4–5 mg) is approximately 1% of the amount found in a single dental amalgam filling or old-style glass thermometer. Other conditions associated with fluorescent light\nIn rare cases individuals with solar urticaria (allergy to sunlight) can get a rash from fluorescent lighting, although this is true of any source of light. One paper suggested that in rare cases, fluorescent lighting can also induce depersonalization and derealization; subsequently, it can worsen depersonalization disorder symptoms. The charity Migraine Action Association reported concerns from members that CFL bulbs can cause migraines, and there are many anecdotal reports of such occurrences.

The vaccines, which are needed only once for those 65-plus, protect against the bacteria that cause pneumonia as well as other serious infections, including meningitis. It is typically treated with antibiotics, but many types of the bacteria have become resistant to those drugs, according to the CDC. The routine vaccines recommended for adults include the seasonal Influenza (Flu) vaccine, Pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine, Herpes zoster (shingles) vaccine, and a booster diphtheria/tetanus (Td) vaccine (adding pertussis (Tdap) once). The pneumonia vaccination is recommended for individuals aged 65 and over, as well as younger adults with chronic illnesses, smokers, or asthmatics. It is always recommended to discuss any concerns or questions with your personal doctor. disease by 74%, but there is insufficient evidence to suggest using the pneumococcal vaccine to prevent pneumonia or death in the general adult population. The pneumococcal vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of community acquired pneumonia in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but does not reduce mortality or the risk of hospitalization for people with this condition. People with COPD are recommended by a number of guidelines to have a pneumococcal vaccination. Other vaccines for which there is support for a protective effect against pneumonia include pertussis, varicella, and measles. Smoking appears to be the single biggest risk factor for pneumococcal pneumonia in otherwise-healthy adults. Appropriately treating underlying illnesses (such as HIV/AIDS, diabetes mellitus, and malnutrition) can decrease the risk of pneumonia. Asthmatics and smokers also fall into the high-risk category and should receive the PPSV 23 pneumococcal vaccine. This is an important recommendation to help protect against pneumococcal disease. It's worth mentioning that there has been a recent change in pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for seniors. Now, it is advised that everyone aged 65 and older should receive both the PPSV 23 and PCV 13 pneumococcal vaccinations. In summary, the pneumonia shot is recommended for individuals who are 65 years and older, those with chronic medical conditions, asthmatics, smokers, and individuals with immunocompromising conditions. It is important to consult with your healthcare provider to determine if you should receive the pneumonia shot based on your specific medical history and risk factors.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In the Senate Vice-President Pence cast a tie-breaking vote. In Fiscal Year 2014, Planned Parenthood clinics received $20.5 million of the $252.6 million distributed under the Title X Family Planning grant program. The proposed American Health Care Act, announced by Congressional Republicans in March 2017, would have made Planned Parenthood \"ineligible for Medicaid reimbursements or federal family planning grants\". Planned Parenthood has, for a long time, helped women gain affordable access to sexual and reproductive-health needs like birth control, pelvic exams, and emergency contraception. As of September 10, women who visit any of the Planned Parenthood of New York City’s five health centers can receive the game-changing therapy, which the Mayo Clinic describes as “medications containing female hormones to replace the ones the body no longer makes after menopause.” And, considering the current political climate, the expansion of offerings is a big deal. “As we face an onslaught of attacks on our sexual and reproductive health and rights from Washington, it’s more important than ever that we expand access to these important services while we continue to fight for our sexual and reproductive freedom,” a press release from the organization notes. There are many factors that affect which type of hormone therapy someone chooses to use, and Planned Parenthood’s service can help women select the best personal option, Kahn says. The bill intends to provide universal access through government funding, complementing thus private sector initiatives for family planning services, such as those offered by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) which supports the Family Planning Organizations of the Philippines and the 97 organizations of the Philippine NGO Council. 43—HHS Title X Funding for Planned Parenthood Rule— reversing Obama's December 2016 regulation which had mandated that Title X recipients—like states local and state governments—distribute federal funds for services related to contraception, sexually transmitted infections, fertility, pregnancy care, and breast and cervical cancer screening to qualified health providers, regardless of whether they also perform abortions\". Republicans want to cut off federal funding from \n\nPlanned Parenthood of New York City's expansion of offerings with menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) contributes to their mission of providing comprehensive sexual and reproductive healthcare services by addressing the healthcare needs of women beyond their reproductive years. With the expansion of their services to include MHT, Planned Parenthood is ensuring that women have access to affordable and essential treatments that can alleviate menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary leakage, and infections. By offering MHT, Planned Parenthood is not only addressing immediate symptom management but also contributing to the long-term health and well-being of women. It is important to note that the expansion of offerings by Planned Parenthood is particularly significant in the current political climate, where sexual and reproductive healthcare is under threat. By expanding access to services like MHT, Planned Parenthood is taking proactive measures to protect and advocate for sexual and reproductive health rights, even in the face of political challenges. While MHT is currently only available at Planned Parenthood of New York City's health centers, individuals outside of the city can check with their nearest Planned Parenthood health center for available services and support.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Heart Failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are morbid diseases that often coexist. However, spirometry is often inaccurate in those with active heart failure. Therefore, we investigated the association between the presence of emphysema on computed tomography (CT) and readmission rates in smokers admitted with heart failure (HF). The cohort included a consecutive group of smokers discharged with HF from a tertiary center between January 1, 2014 and April 1, 2014 who also had a CT of the chest for dyspnea. Over the study period, there were 225 inpatient smokers with HF who had a concurrent chest CT (155 [69%] males, age 69±11 years, ejection fraction [EF] 46±18%, 107 [48%] LVEF of < 50%). Emphysema on CT was present in 103 (46%) and these were older, had a lower BMI, more pack-years, less diabetes and an increased afterload. When separated by emphysema on CT, any readmission, 30-day readmission, length of stay and mortality were higher among HF patients with emphysema. In multivariable regression, emphysema by CT was associated with a two-fold higher (adjusted HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.41-3.15, p < 0.001) risk of readmission and a trend toward increased mortality (adjusted HR 1.70 95% CI 0.86-3.34, p = 0.12). In conclusion, emphysema by CT is a frequent finding in smokers hospitalized with HF and is associated with adverse outcomes in HF. This under recognized group of patients with both emphysema and heart failure may benefit from improved recognition and characterization of their co-morbid disease processes and optimization of therapies for their lung disease.

Abortion rates changed little between 2003 and 2008, before which they decreased for at least two decades as access to family planning and birth control increased. Countries that permit abortions have different limits on how late in pregnancy abortion is allowed. Abortion rates are similar between countries that ban abortion and countries that allow it. Historically, abortions have been attempted using \n\n 14-16 percent of maternal deaths resulted from abortion. In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth. In 2012, for every 1,000 children born in Sweden, 5.2 pregnancies were terminated following prenatal testing. The mother chose to terminate the pregnancy in 88 percent of cases when the child had anencaphaly, when part of the child's brain is missing. They also chose abortion in 75 percent of cases where doctors detected bilateral renal agenesis - when the child is missing both kidneys. \"What we've also seen as an effect is that early-term abortions have resulted in foetuses being aborted that would have ended in miscarriages a few weeks later,\" Lund University reproductive epidemiology researcher Karin Källén, who worked on the report, told the TT news agency. the government denied this, and claimed that it did not intend to question women's right to access safe abortion.

Specialists currently diagnose Alzheimer's disease using memory tests and by tracking behavioral changes. However, by the time that the symptoms appear, the disease has already progressed. For these reasons, researchers are hard at work trying to devise newer and better diagnostic tools for Alzheimer's. For instance, some scientists are trying to use a \"sniff test\" as a way of assessing whether someone has dementia. Now, researchers at Duke University in Durham, NC, say that Alzheimer's could be diagnosed in seconds just by looking at a person's eyes, and scientists at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel concur. Using an innovative and noninvasive eye imaging technique, the scientists maintain that they can distinguish between signs of Alzheimer's and signs of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is a condition that raises the risk of Alzheimer's but is not harmful in itself. In the first study, scientists compared the retinas of people with Alzheimer's with those of people who had only MCI, and with the retinas of those who had neither of these conditions. Also, a certain layer of the retina was thinner in people with Alzheimer's than in those with MCI or people who did not have any form of cognitive impairment. The scientists speculate that the changes in the retina reflect the disruptions in the brain's blood vessels that Alzheimer's causes. It's not possible for current techniques like a brain scan or lumbar puncture (spinal tap) to screen the number of patients with this disease. We need to detect the disease earlier and introduce treatments earlier.\" The scientists compared brain scans and retina images from these people with the retinas and brains of those without a family history of Alzheimer's. The study revealed that the retina is thinner in people with a higher genetic risk of Alzheimer's. Both of these dementia signs correlated with a poor score on the cognitive impairment test. It is among the first regions that Alzheimer's disease affects, with studies demonstrating that dementia affects neurogenesis — that is, the formation of new neurons — in the hippocampus, and that Alzheimer's disease reduces the size of this brain region altogether. Dr. Rotenstreich comments on the significance of these findings, saying, \"A brain scan can detect Alzheimer's when the disease is well beyond a treatable phase.\" Besides monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, PiB might allow for earlier diagnosis and might distinguish Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia, helping doctors tailor the most effective treatment and management regimens for their patients.When a patient diagnosed with Alzheimer's, on the other hand, is asked to concentrate on a task, the default network does not quiet down at all, but instead gets noisier, indicating a severe disruption of the normal balance of power between this network and areas of the brain devoted to goal-directed activity. \"You have to get to this pathology before it has its biggest effect, before it has done its damage,\" says psychiatrist William Klunk, coauthor of the paper and head of the University of Pittsburgh team that developed a powerful tool for imaging Alzheimer's, a substance known as Pittsburgh Compound B, or PiB. This radioactive dye can attach itself to plaque deposits in the brain, allowing scientists to use PET scans to spot the disease in patients long before symptoms occur. Besides monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, PiB might allow for earlier diagnosis and might distinguish Alzheimer's from other forms of dementia, helping doctors tailor the most effective treatment and management regimens for their patients.A 2009 fMRI study out of Columbia University Medical Center revealed a major underlying mechanism of this phenomenon when it linked blood sugar control to activity in the dentate gyrus, a small area nestled in the hippocampus and thought to be key to the formation of new memories. This observation provides a molecular mechanism to explain the widely published observation that infections by certain pathogens, such as herpes virus, contribute to loss of brain function and increased incidence of Alzheimer Disease. the eyes: These tests, which include visual-evoked responses and electroretinograms, can detect various eye problems common in childhood NCLs. A CT scan may reveal brain areas that are decaying in NCL patients. ; Enzyme assay: A recent development in diagnosis of NCL is the use of enzyme assays that look for specific missing lysosomal \n\nHow long does it take you to grasp test aimed at spotting dementia? This would allow an earlier diagnosis of the disease, a goal dedicated scientists have attempted to reach for years, albeit unsuccessfully. The study, led by experts at the University of Birmingham, offer hope of potentially finding a cure for dementia in the coming years. Brain scans showed that slower responses are 'aberrant' in individuals who will go onto develop Alzheimer's disease, the study published in Neuroimage Clinical found. They were fitted with EEG (electroencephalogram) skull caps. Dr Hilda Hayo, chief executive of Dementia UK, said the charity \"welcomes anything that can speed up the process of getting a diagnosis of dementia\". Clare Walton, research manager at Alzheimer's Society, said 'research like this give us hope' of finding a way to diagnose the disease early on. It is not a type of dementia, but a person with MCI is more likely to go on to develop it. Officials estimate there to be around 47 million dementia sufferers across the world, with nearly 10 million new cases reported each year. Diagnosing the disease earlier would offer hope of prescribing drugs when they are more likely to work, and encouraging lifestyle changes that can stave off dementia.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Even among brain dead patients, in a U.S. study of 252 brain dead patients from 1990–96, only 5 (2.8%) cases involved pregnant women between 15 and 45 years of age. Past cases \n\nIn the 28-year period between 1982 and 2010, there were \"30 [reported] cases of maternal brain death (19 case reports and 1 case series).\" In 12 of those cases, a viable child was delivered via cesarean section after extended somatic support. there is no widely accepted protocol to manage a brain dead mother \"since only a few reported cases are found in the medical literature.\" Life support complications \n\nThroughout their care, brain dead patients could experience a wide range of complications, including \"infection, hemodynamic instability, diabetes insipidus (DI), panhypopituitarism, poikilothermia, metabolic instability, acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\" Treating these complications is difficult since the effects of medication on the fetus's health are unknown. However, the older a fetus is when its mother becomes brain dead, the greater its chance for survival. Research into preterm births indicates that \"a fetus born before 24 weeks of gestation has a limited chance of survival.

Difference between brain death and coma \n\nPeople in comas have \"presence of brain stem responses, spontaneous breathing or non-purposeful motor responses.\" However, comas can result in brain death, or recovery or even a persistent vegetative state. U.S.A. Federal and state laws \n\nSeveral laws have bearing in situations that involve maternal somatic support after brain death. This recent situation involving Marlise Muñoz raised a host of questions related to unborn fetuses, patient and family preferences, and hospital discretion in interpreting state laws that involve advance directives. Cost of care \n\nThe cost of maintaining a brain dead mother on life support depends on the number of days spent in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of the twelve viable children known to be delivered from brain dead mothers on prolonged somatic support between 1982 and 2010, the mean gestational age at the time of brain death was 22 weeks and the mean gestational age at delivery was 29.5 weeks, leading to an average length of somatic support for the mothers in the ICU of 7.5 weeks (52.5 days). The most recent peer-reviewed investigation to note the overall cost of care for a viable child delivered from a somatically supported brain dead mother focused on the case of a child delivered via cesarean section in California on the 63rd hospital day at 31 weeks gestation, to a mother who was brain dead at 22 weeks gestation in 1983.

For example, the FIGO Committee for the Ethical Aspects of Human Reproduction and Women's Health has published Brain Death and Pregnancy, a report to help clinicians, healthcare administrators, and families evaluate the ethical considerations surrounding women's health. When a pregnant woman becomes brain dead, the mother can no longer acknowledge the fetus; as such, the mother no longer has a moral responsibility for keeping the fetus alive. Finally, some ethicists have argued that there are no ethical dilemmas inherent in the case of a pregnant woman who is declared brain dead. They argue that because the brain dead patient is no longer alive, he or she ceases to be a patient; the continuation of ventilation in an effort to save the fetus can be considered a medical experiment that requires ethics committee or IRB-approval before a facility can perform this work. Public opinion and activism \n\nKeeping a medically declared 'brain dead' woman on life support to sustain a potentially viable fetus is a topic of considerable debate and controversy. There is heavy discourse between biomedical and legal experts regarding whether a dead person is \"a dysfunctional incubator\" to an unborn fetus. Arguments have been made in favor of or against preserving the somatic function of a dead pregnant woman. Supporters against life-sustaining efforts, when it conflicts with a woman's wishes, include pro-choice groups, like NARAL Pro-Choice America.

Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. Timeline\n\nJanuary 2020 \n\nOn 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 \n\nOn 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations \n\nTurkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue \n\nOn 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Explaining that the return to normal life will happen gradually, Ministry of Health stated that Turkey has an opportunity to create and upgrade to permanently pandemic-resistant cities by subsidizing businesses to make ventilation upgrades to limit spread of viruses, tackling poor indoor air quality, which has long been a source of disease. On 7 May, the government acknowledged that the social-distancing measures, including the closure of offices and schools, ban on mass gatherings were rolled out without knowing which measures would work. Ministry of Health stated that by relaxing restrictions gradually, it will be able to make more informed recommendations on social-distancing measures in the future. On 2 June, the Turkish Parliament resumed full activities for the first time in 48 days since a hiatus was declared due to the pandemic. July 2020: Turkey opens for tourism \n\nIn July, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged a rewrite of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board guidelines to discourage reporting asymptomatic people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. On 30 August, mayors of Istanbul and Ankara Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş said that there was a mismatch between the statistics reported by Ministry of Health and the local data, and accused the national government of covering up the coronavirus resurgence. On 2 October, Minister of Internal Affairs, following an advisory opinion of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board, instructed all provinces to prohibit holding large public meetings until 1 December 2020. December 2020: Rising death roll and assessment of coronavirus vaccines \n\nOn 6 December, Ministry of Health Fahrettin Koca announced that 50 million doses of CoronaVac should arrive by the end of February 2021, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should start arriving still during December. Earlier in the spring of 2020, during the first COVID-19 surge in the Turkey, the rising death toll reached a peak on 22 April, with a seven-day average of 122 daily deaths. In December, the seven-day average of deaths in Turkey from COVID-19 broke that record, at 255 on 29 December. On 14 January 2021, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan received the COVID-19 vaccine. March 2021 \nAt the beginning of March, the Turkish government eased the restrictions, but the rates of infections rose to 21030. Turkey has witnessed a very bad season of tourism due to the restrictions of the pandemic but bars and restaurants were allowed to reopen at half-capacity in provinces with lower infection rates. On 30 March, Turkey said that it will reimpose lockdowns during weekends and restrictions during Ramadan, and that is after confirming 37,303 new cases. February 2022 \nOn February 5, 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his wife, Emine, have tested positive for COVID-19. Erdogan announced that they had been infected with the Omicron coronavirus and were experiencing mild symptoms. Government response\n\nChild welfare and education\n\nOn 12 March 2020, the Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Economy \nThroughout the pandemic, despite additional headwinds such as Saudi bans on Turkish goods, Turkish economy has performed far better than that of many of the country's peers. Turkey provided a boost to the economy in a series of historically large economic packages. International aid \n\nDuring the pandemic, Turkey has provided funds, doctors, dispatched medical equipment such as PPE, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing kits, and other assistance to at least 55 countries. By setting itself up as a provider rather than a recipient of aid, Turkey portrayed itself as a valuable partner in combating the global spread of SARS-CoV-2. The first case in Turkey was recorded on 11 March, when a local returned home from a trip to Europe. Turkey stood out from the rest of Europe by not ordering a legal lockdown until April 2021, when the country enacted its first nationwide restrictions. The resulting wave of infections never came close to overwhelming the Turkish health system, which has the highest number of intensive care units in the world at 46.5 beds per 100,000 people (compared to 9.6 in Greece, 11.6 in France, and 12.6 in Italy). , Turkey's observed case-fatality rate stands at 0.84%, the 148th highest rate globally. However, according to an August 2020 academic study by The International Journal of Health Planning and Management, the government of Turkey has been underreporting COVID-19 statistics. On 30 September 2020, Turkish Minister of Health Fahrettin Koca acknowledged that since 29 July, the reported number of cases was limited to symptomatic cases that required monitoring, which was met with rebuke by the Turkish Medical Association. Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. Timeline\n\nJanuary 2020 \n\nOn 10 January 2020, ignoring China's insistence on the lack of evidence for human-to-human transmission, Ministry of Health experts stated that they suspected that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted among people, and accordingly set up the Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board. February 2020 \n\nOn 1 February, Turkey announced its decision to stop all the flights from China. After Iranian authorities downplayed the spread of SARS‑CoV‑2, Turkey castigated Iran for its duplicity and laxity and unilaterally closed its border on 23 February. On 29 February, Turkey announced the termination of all flights to and from Italy, South Korea and Iraq. March 2020: First confirmed case, closures, and cancellations \n\nTurkish cities carried out massive disinfection work in public places and mass transit vehicles. The next day, Ministry of National Education announced that with the exception of schools catering to students with special needs, all schools in Turkey would close starting on 16 March 2020. Minister Koca updated the number of infected people as four on 13 March, including a pilgrim who had returned from Saudi Arabia. Following the updated tally, Turkey extended the flight ban to also include many European countries, including Austria, France, and Germany. With that announcement, more than 80 million people in Turkey started to live under some form of restrictions to their movements when trains and public transit came to a halt nationwide. At the same time, Turkey started to open drive-through screening clinics, based on the South Korean-pioneered model, which allows the provision of tests at no cost, while avoiding nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2. On 21 March, the Minister of the Interior Soylu announced a total curfew, effective midnight on 22 March, for those who are over the age of 65 or persons whose immune system is compromised due to \"chronic pulmonary diseases, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, hypertension, and liver disease.\" April 2020: Restrictions continue \n\nOn 2 April, Istanbul Medical Chamber expressed concern about Ministry of Health's tally, which included only the cases confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction tests, thereby excluding the ELISAs administered in private hospitals. In a televised address on the same day, President Erdoğan announced the measures that prohibit entries into and exit from Turkey's largest cities, including the commercial hub Istanbul for 15 days. On 13 April, President Erdoğan announced that curfews on weekends would continue but the restrictions were less stringent during the week, and many non-essential businesses, including construction sites remained open. On 23 April, Turkey became the seventh country to report more than 100,000 coronavirus cases. Explaining that the return to normal life will happen gradually, Ministry of Health stated that Turkey has an opportunity to create and upgrade to permanently pandemic-resistant cities by subsidizing businesses to make ventilation upgrades to limit spread of viruses, tackling poor indoor air quality, which has long been a source of disease. On 7 May, the government acknowledged that the social-distancing measures, including the closure of offices and schools, ban on mass gatherings were rolled out without knowing which measures would work. Ministry of Health stated that by relaxing restrictions gradually, it will be able to make more informed recommendations on social-distancing measures in the future. On 2 June, the Turkish Parliament resumed full activities for the first time in 48 days since a hiatus was declared due to the pandemic. July 2020: Turkey opens for tourism \n\nIn July, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan urged a rewrite of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board guidelines to discourage reporting asymptomatic people who test positive for SARS-CoV-2. On 30 August, mayors of Istanbul and Ankara Ekrem İmamoğlu and Mansur Yavaş said that there was a mismatch between the statistics reported by Ministry of Health and the local data, and accused the national government of covering up the coronavirus resurgence. On 2 October, Minister of Internal Affairs, following an advisory opinion of Coronavirus Scientific Advisory Board, instructed all provinces to prohibit holding large public meetings until 1 December 2020. December 2020: Rising death roll and assessment of coronavirus vaccines \n\nOn 6 December, Ministry of Health Fahrettin Koca announced that 50 million doses of CoronaVac should arrive by the end of February 2021, and 10 million doses of the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine should start arriving still during December. Earlier in the spring of 2020, during the first COVID-19 surge in the Turkey, the rising death toll reached a peak on 22 April, with a seven-day average of 122 daily deaths. In December, the seven-day average of deaths in Turkey from COVID-19 broke that record, at 255 on 29 December.

United States passenger airlines can expect about $50 billion in subsidies from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. The COVID-19 pandemic in the North Mariana Islands is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 () caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (). Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll. The first death from coronavirus in the CNMI occurred on March 30 at Kanoa Resort. The continuation of daily United Airlines' nonstop flights from Guam 120 miles away led to all arriving individuals suspected of coronavirus symptoms to be placed in quarantine at the Kanoa Resort.

Background \nOn 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed that a novel coronavirus was the cause of a respiratory illness in a cluster of people in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which was reported to the WHO on 31 December 2019. The case fatality ratio for COVID-19 has been much lower than SARS of 2003, but the transmission has been significantly greater, with a significant total death toll.

In reality, there are no vaccines with coronaviruses. The NIH said there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against its use to treat COVID-19. ; That flu vaccines increase the chance of contracting COVID-19 by 36%. This webpage summarizes some of the studies that document risks associated with the influenza vaccine. Pregnant women vaccinated against seasonal influenza and A-H1N1 (swine flu) had high rates of spontaneous abortions. Influenza vaccines are not effective in young children; safety data can't be trusted. Children who receive an inactivated influenza vaccine are significantly more likely than non-vaccinated children to be hospitalized. Influenza vaccination increases the risk of Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS). Influenza-related death rates in the elderly do not improve by increasing influenza vaccination rates in the elderly. There is no evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers against influenza to protect their elderly patients is effective. Health authorities exaggerate the dangers of influenza and inflate the benefits of influenza vaccination. The purpose of the latest study on the link between the flu vaccine and miscarriages in pregnant women was to assess the potential association between the vaccine and an increased risk of miscarriages. This strain was significantly different from previous strains, and as a result, the annual influenza vaccine was modified to protect against H1N1. The study was conducted to ensure that the new flu vaccine, which was designed to protect against H1N1, was as safe as earlier versions. It was part of an ongoing effort by the U.S. medical community, specifically the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to monitor the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. The researchers involved in the study were surprised by the findings, as their earlier research had found no significant association between the flu vaccine and miscarriages during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 flu seasons. It is important to understand that the study does not definitively establish a link between the flu vaccine and miscarriages. Further research and investigation are needed to better understand any potential association between the flu vaccine and miscarriages in pregnant women.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

While the condition of two individuals improved with supportive therapy and antibiotics, the third gorilla died three days following initiation of treatment. This report confirms a HPIV-2 respiratory illness and associated death in a gorilla. She was back at CIRMF, doing research on a monkey virus, when the WCS field vet working out here was killed in a plane crash coming into a backcountry Gabonese airstrip. The scope of her work, Reed told me, encompassed a range of infectious diseases that threaten gorilla health, of which Ebola is only the most exotic. The others were largely human diseases of more conventional flavor, to which gorillas are susceptible because of their close genetic similarity to us: TB, poliomyelitis, measles, pneumonia, chickenpox, et cetera. Gorillas can be exposed to such infections wherever unhealthy people are walking, coughing, sneezing, and crapping in the forest. Any such spillover in the reverse direction—from humans to nonhuman animals—is known as an _anthroponosis_. The famous mountain gorillas, for instance, have been threatened by anthroponotic infections such as measles, carried by ecotourists who come to dote upon them. This can happen either directly or indirectly through another infected species. Additionally, past Ebola outbreaks in Africa have been linked to the consumption of great apes as bush meat or handling dead gorillas or chimpanzees that died from Ebola. It's important to note that both animals and humans can remain infectious with Ebola for a period of time after death. A 2006 study published in Science concluded more than 5,000 gorillas may have died in \n\n Despite the protection garnered from being located in national parks, the mountain gorilla is also at risk from people of a more well-meaning nature. With a similar genetic makeup to humans and an immune system that has not evolved to cope with human disease, this poses a serious conservation threat. Indeed, according to some researchers, infectious diseases (predominantly respiratory) are responsible for approximately 20% of sudden deaths in mountain gorilla populations.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

These programs often involve providing patients, relatives, and carers with information about the reason for the catheter and the plan for review and removal. This may include written information on how to manage the catheter and drainage system, minimize the risk of urinary tract infection, and obtain additional supplies suitable for individual needs. In addition to patient education, quality improvement programs may incorporate various interventions to reduce the risk of infection. These interventions can include clinical guidelines for catheter insertion and maintenance, education for healthcare providers, audits and feedback to ensure compliance with policies, reminder systems for physicians/nurses to prompt catheter removal when it is no longer necessary, automated or nurse-driven removal protocols (where the catheter is removed after a specified period unless countermanded by the physician), and the use of bladder scanners to assess urinary retention and support appropriate catheterization. These components have been studied in various combinations as part of quality improvement programs aimed at reducing CAUTI risk. Research has shown that these interventions can be effective in minimizing unnecessary catheter use and reducing CAUTI rates. Reference:\n- Murphy M.

Of particular note is the distinction between symptomatic UTI vs. asymptomatic UTI (or, ASB). These definitions were provided to us from the North Carolina Center for Hospital Quality and Patient Safety, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and from a toolkit used by the Michigan Health and Hospital Association written by Mohamad G. Fakih, MD, MPH, Sanjay Saint, MD, MPH, Sarah Krein, RN, PhD., and Russ Olmsted, MPH, CIC. Given the important clinical and economic consequences of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), researchers across the world have attempted various methods to prevent this common, costly, and morbid patient safety problem. In this section, we summarize the evidence supporting the use of several practices to prevent CAUTI. Fortunately, members of our Ann Arbor VA Medical Center/University of Michigan Patient Safety Research group have been involved in the development of most of these guidelines. Do not use the indwelling catheter unless you must! Urinary tract infection represents almost 40% of all healthcare-associated infections, with the vast majority due to the indwelling urinary catheter. Over 900,000 patients develop a catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) in a U.S. hospital each year. Urinary catheter-related infection leads to substantial morbidity. The incidence of bacteriuria in catheterized patients is about 5% per day. The presentation of catheter-associated infection varies from asymptomatic bacteriuria to overwhelming sepsis and even death. Patients with bloodstream infection may present with fever, confusion, and hypotension. A key first step leading to CAUTI is the colonization of the catheter with organisms. Many of the infectious complications of the urinary catheter could be prevented by using the catheter only when necessary and promptly removing it when no longer needed. Over five decades ago, the late Dr. Paul Beeson persuasively argued against the routine use of indwelling urinary catheters in hospitalized patients. While these devices provide important benefits in some patients, they are also the primary risk factor for catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Indwelling urinary catheters, however, also lead to significant non-infectious complications. Urinary catheters cause patient discomfort. In one prospective study, for example, 42% of catheterized patients report the indwelling catheter was uncomfortable, 48% complained that it was painful, and 61% noted that it restricted their activities of daily living. Thus, for some patients urinary catheters operate as a physical restraint, tantamount to binding them to the bed, substantially and unnecessarily limiting their ability to function freely and with dignity. Restricted activity not only reduces patient autonomy, it also promotes other patient safety problems, such as venous thromboembolism, deconditioning, and pressure ulcers. In short, there are compelling reasons to limit indwelling urinary catheterization because of both non-infectious and infectious complications. The Ann Arbor Criteria are an updated set of recommendations that define when use of an indwelling urinary catheter is appropriate for hospitalized medical patients. Aseptic technique is strongly recommended during the insertion of indwelling urinary catheters, based on biologic principles, the pathogenesis of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and the growing prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms. A recent analysis of patient safety practices by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality emphasized the important role of nurses in preventing CAUTI, the most common healthcare-associated infection. While physicians and medical students occasionally insert indwelling urinary catheters, nurses are generally responsible for the insertion and maintenance of urinary catheters; unlicensed personnel may also insert indwelling catheters under the direction of registered nurses. As part of their nursing education, student nurses are taught catheter insertion practices through simulation and clinical experiences. Anecdotal evidence – coupled with preliminary observations done by the University of Michigan CAUTI research group – reveal that proper aseptic technique is not reliably used when indwelling urinary catheters are inserted. The risk of infection increases by 5% for each day that a catheter remains in place, and the length of time that a catheter remains in place is the most important risk factor for the development of catheter-associated urinary tract infection. Up to half of patients with an indwelling catheter for 5 days or longer will have bacteria or fungus in their urine. Therefore, once an indwelling urinary catheter is inserted, ongoing vigilance (abstract) is needed to reduce the risks of both infectious and non-infectious complications. Many times physicians are not aware that patients’ urinary catheters are still in place, so we begin this section with assessment strategies to maintain awareness of catheter presence and determine the ongoing need for an indwelling catheter. In this section we also provide evidence-based guidance for catheter care and securement, drainage, transportation with a catheter, and talking points for patients and families related to indwelling urinary catheters. While it is better for the patient not to have an indwelling urinary catheter at all, when catheters are necessary our recommendations in this section will help minimize risks associated with catheter use. Thus, many hours and days can pass before a urinary catheter that is no longer necessary is recognized and removed; by default, urinary catheters usually remain in place until these steps occur. In contrast, using strategies to remind and prompt removal of unnecessary urinary catheters has the potential to bypass several of these steps, and reduce the occurrence of hospital-acquired catheter-associated urinary tract infections. “Reminders” function simply to remind the clinicians (physician and/or nurse) that a urinary catheter is still being used, and may provide an educational list of reasons to continue or discontinue the urinary catheter. “Stop orders” prompt the clinician to remove the catheter by default after a certain time period or a set of clinical conditions has occurred (such as 24 or 48 hours post-operative) unless the catheter remains clinically appropriate. Stop orders “expire” in the same fashion as restraint or antibiotic orders, unless action is taken by physicians. Stop orders directed at nurses will empower nurses to remove the catheter on the basis of a list of indications, without requiring the nurse to obtain a physician-signed order before removing the catheter (bypassing steps 1-4). Using electronic catheter orders can increase catheter use inadvertently by making indwelling catheters easier to order than alternatives. Physicians and/or nurses should document the rationale for leaving the catheter in if appropriate indications are not met. Nurses may not be comfortable initially with the responsibility of removing urinary catheters without a physician order. Incontinence is a very tempting reason for placing a urinary catheter. Encourage bedside staff to avoid placing catheters for incontinence by providing other readily available strategies to manage incontinent patients, including bedside commodes, incontinence garments, condom catheters for male patients, and “people power” to provide prompted toileting and bed linen changes. Several clinical and economic studies have evaluated antimicrobial urinary catheters, including individual trials, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Economic evaluations are important to consider given the additional cost of antimicrobial catheter trays (approximately $5). Different antimicrobial urinary catheters have been evaluated in patients over the past few decades, including silver (either alloy or oxide) and nitrofurazone-releasing catheters. A large and scientifically rigorous trial – involving 24 hospitals in the United Kingdom and about 7000 patients (most of whom were undergoing surgery) – was published in The Lancet. This randomized trial compared three different catheters – silver alloy, nitrofurazone-releasing, and a control (polytetrafluoroethylene–coated latex catheter) – and found no significant difference in rates of symptomatic CAUTI between the silver alloy and control catheters. There was a small decrease in rates of symptomatic CAUTI with the use of nitrofurazone-releasing catheters compared with control, however, this decrease was not deemed to be clinically important. The makers of the nitrofurazone-releasing catheter announced (PDF) in 2012 that they will discontinue manufacturing and marketing the device. An accompanying editorial provides a useful perspective on the limitations of this study as well as the role of antimicrobial catheters in patients at high-risk of CAUTI (e.g., neutropenic and severely immune-compromised patients). ​Currently, antimicrobial catheters are not recommended for routine use in hospitalized patients. Indwelling urinary catheters lead to both infectious and non-infectious complications. Despite these potential harms, studies have found that initial catheterization was inappropriate 21% to 50% of the time, and that continued catheter use was inappropriate almost half of the days that patients are catheterized. A common reason for inappropriate continued catheter use is that physicians forget, or are never aware of, the presence of the catheter. In one multi-center evaluation, inpatient physicians at 4 hospitals were asked whether or not each patient on their service had a urinary catheter in place. Incorrect negative responses were recorded for over one-third of attending physicians and more than a quarter of resident physicians. For inappropriately catheterized patients, the proportion of physicians unaware of the presence of a catheter was even higher (over 50% for attending physicians and over 40% of senior residents). These “forgotten” catheters often remain in the patient until either a catheter-related complication occurs or the patient’s discharge is imminent. Physicians should assess daily whether or not their catheterized patient still requires the catheter. While nursing involvement in catheter insertion, care, and removal is paramount, physicians also play an important role in prevention efforts. The physician champion – often an infectious diseases specialist, hospital epidemiologist, urologist, or hospitalist – can inform physicians about the planned prevention program, encourage support for the program, be available to answer questions, and help educate other physicians about the appropriate indications for catheter use. Below, we provide specific strategies for engaging physicians in CAUTI prevention. However nurse engagement is defined, it refers to buy-in, and in our case buy-in by nurses for the catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) prevention program. The question answered in this section is: how can nurses break their bond with the catheter? Below, we provide specific strategies for engaging nurses in CAUTI prevention. This section describes several common barriers encountered by other hospitals when instituting changes related to the insertion and care of indwelling urinary catheters as well as the strategies they used to overcome those barriers (PDF). While the situation may not be exactly the same at your hospital, both the barriers described and the suggestions provided may be helpful in identifying potential solutions when challenges arise or for anticipating issues that may need to be addressed. For example, Francke and colleagues (2008) examined 12 systematic reviews and identified the following categories as influencing guideline adherence: guideline characteristics, implementation strategies, professional autonomy, and patient and environment characteristics. (2009) reviewed 21 studies and identified perceived barriers for quality initiatives including unawareness, lack of credible data, lack of management support for physicians, and lack of resources. Importantly, some of the most important leaders in infection prevention activities are not senior executives. In brief, since October 2008, hospitals are no longer eligible for additional payment from CMS to treat several common and/or high morbidity hospital-acquired complications, such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections and pressure ulcers. ​We began our work over 10 years ago, and through our research we have identified key elements for developing a comprehensive program to reduce indwelling urinary catheter use and reduce CAUTI. A general overview for developing a program to reduce CAUTI can be found via the button below. The units chosen should have the combination of a higher than average (for your institution) prevalence of Foley (urinary) catheters along with staff that are engaged and willing to support a catheter use improvement project. A key aspect of implementing a ‘catheter out’/CAUTI prevention program is to identify an implementation team at your site. This toolkit provides materials and information to reduce indwelling urinary catheter use and CAUTI among hospitalized adult patients. This customization process is one of the responsibilities of the implementation team because the individuals on this group are the most likely to have insights about what may or may not work in your hospital. Factors to consider in the customization process include: current policies and procedures, resources, patient population and the involved personnel. Use the materials in this toolkit as a template, but be creative and construct a program that will be successful and lead to a sustainable reduction in catheter use at your institution. The materials found in Detailed Protocols can also be used as a standard approach that may require little or minimal customization at some hospitals. For example, measuring indwelling urinary catheter use rates can provide important information for identifying the units in which to begin your program, while continued assessments can be used to encourage staff and to help maintain observed improvements. ​Collecting data is critically important for understanding whether or not your facility has an unacceptably high number of patients with indwelling urinary catheters without an appropriate indication. Collecting and comparing data both before and after an intervention will provide a relatively objective way to evaluate if your interventions are successful in reducing unnecessary catheter-days and subsequent catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI). Once indwelling catheter use and catheter-associated urinary tract infection rates have substantially decreased, you’ll want to know how to keep these rates low. ​And speaking of education, why not disseminate how well your organization has managed to reduce and possibly eliminate the most common of all healthcare-associated infections? Reducing CAUTI can become a source of organizational pride and possibly lead to a reduction in other infections as well. In the Detailed Protocols section are two detailed protocols, one designed to reduce CAUTI in the emergency department, and another designed for nurses to lead and to reduce CAUTI in non-intensive care units. Fliers and pocket cards can be useful tools to frequently remind care givers about appropriate indications and early removal of indwelling urinary catheters. These tools can be used to publicize and disseminate your local indwelling urinary catheter removal message to physicians, nurses, aides and other staff involved in the insertion and care of indwelling urinary catheters!

Firstly, the familiarity of the barbershop setting within the participants' community can help foster a sense of comfort and trust. In the study mentioned, barbers were trained to measure blood pressure and provide counseling on hypertension. As trusted advisors within the community, barbers played a crucial role in engaging participants and facilitating discussions on healthcare. This approach allowed for easy access to blood pressure screenings and immediate referrals to healthcare professionals, such as pharmacists who were available in the barbershop. The convenience of having healthcare services provided within the barbershop itself eliminates the need for participants to travel to another location for assistance. Moreover, the study highlighted that the interventions in the barbershop setting were associated with increased patient compliance and efficacy of treatment. Participants in the intervention group, who received screenings and pharmacist consultations in the barbershop, were more receptive to lifestyle modification recommendations. Overall, conducting a study on high blood pressure in a barbershop setting offers advantages such as enhanced patient engagement, improved accessibility, and increased compliance. \"barbershop\" in reference to music) contains the lines: \"'Cause Mister when you start that minor part I feel your fingers slipping and a grasping at my heart, Oh Lord play that Barber shop chord!\" One characteristic feature of barbershop harmony is the use of what is \n\n Many African American men say that they avoid health clinics due to unkempt appearance, so Project Brotherhood staffs a barber to give haircuts and talk to men about health issues ranging from prostate cancer to HIV.

Cortisol is a hormone that is released in response to stress, and higher levels of cortisol can indicate chronic stress and long-lasting changes in the functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. In addition to higher hair cortisol levels, women who have experienced IPV also tend to report more severe symptoms of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, it should be noted that depressive symptoms and hair cortisol levels in these children are not significantly different from those in children who have not witnessed IPV. Interestingly, there is a positive association between the number of injury events and the level of hair cortisol in children. Psychological Stress Increases Oxidative Stress\n\nChronic stress increases oxidative stress on the body (the imbalance between free radical production and antioxidant defense in the body), which is very harmful because many physical and mental illnesses are linked to increased oxidative stress.Elevated hair cortisol levels have been documented in various stressed-out populations, including endurance athletes, shift workers (night-shift workers showed higher hair cortisol levels than day-shift workers), unemployed people, students facing a major life event (death of a close relative or serious illness), people experiencing pain, and stressed-out children. Regarding mental illnesses, higher hair cortisol levels were observed in patients suffering from major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, in patients with anxiety disorder, hair cortisol levels were reduced compared to healthy people. Moreover, in PTSD patients, after an initial increase, hair cortisol levels may decrease, indicating less cortisol output due to a dysfunctional HPA axis.60\n\nInterestingly, hair cortisol level is reduced following effective stress management. The authors concluded that hair cortisol level is superior to salivary cortisol as a marker of stress.61\n\nHair cortisol may be a better biomarker of stress than serum, saliva, or urine cortisol. Hair cortisol analysis can be used to better understand the relationship between income dynamics and health outcomes in middle-aged women by providing insights into the pathways involved in these associations. Hair cortisol analysis is a method that estimates cumulative cortisol secretion over an extended period of time, thus providing a measure of sustained cortisol output. In a study conducted on 164 working women aged 26-65, a negative association was found between hair cortisol and concurrent income, as well as changes in income over a 4-year period. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, hair treatment, and country. By measuring cortisol levels in hair, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the long-term effects of social mobility on cortisol regulation and explore other psychosocial factors that may contribute to these associations. It is important to note that this study utilized a longitudinal design, and further research using hair cortisol analysis is needed to clarify the time course of social mobility in relation to long-term cortisol levels. Overall, hair cortisol analysis provides a valuable tool for studying the relationship between income dynamics and health outcomes in middle-aged women, offering insights into the potential mechanisms through which socio-economic status influences health. After studying a group of 283 individuals between the ages of 65 and 85 years old, researchers discovered that cortisol levels found within the composition of hair could reveal a person’s risk for heart disease. The study concluded that high cortisol levels contained within strands leads to greater risk for stroke, coronary disease, diabetes or peripheral arterial disease. \"Because scalp hair can capture information about how cortisol levels have changed over time, hair analysis gives us a better tool for evaluating that risk,\" she explained. Researchers say the long-term link between cortisol and the heart must be further explored before hair testing becomes a standard in cardiovascular wellbeing. Yes, research has shown that there is an association between socioeconomic status (SES) in children and hair cortisol levels, which serves as a biological measure of chronic stress. The study you mentioned found that children and adolescents from families with low SES had chronically higher levels of cortisol in their scalp hair. This association between SES and cortisol was even observed in children of young age, indicating its potential long-term impact on health outcomes. These elevated cortisol levels may have adverse effects on a child's health and increase the risk of cardio metabolic diseases later in life.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Zeng Guang, the Chief Scientist at China CDC believed that a quicker publication of the epidemic information was a lesson that China learned from the SARS outbreak as the lack of information release worsened the outbreak. A pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by the doctor Zhang Jixian in Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December. On 30 December, a test report addressed to Wuhan Central Hospital, from company CapitalBio Medlab, stated an erroneous positive result for SARS, causing a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result. The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on \"the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause\" that same evening. Eight of these doctors, including \n\n Pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by bacteria or viruses and less commonly by fungi and parasites. A causative agent may not be isolated in about half of cases despite careful testing. In an active population-based surveillance for community-acquired pneumonia requiring hospitalization in five hospitals in Chicago and Nashville from January 2010 through June 2012, 2259 patients were identified who had radiographic evidence of pneumonia and specimens that could be tested for the \n\nCommon signs of infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 include fever, cough, and breathing difficulties.

The patient had been a mystery to Huang Wenjie. But the patient's rapid deterioration, combined with his unresponsiveness to any therapy, had left Huang Wenjie, a forty-two-year-old career military medical officer, struggling to come up with a diagnosis. In the case of the twenty-seven-year-old from Heyuan, there had been no effective course of therapy, and the patient's condition deteriorated so rapidly that within a day of his admission, he no longer recognized his own family. But still, in China, one case was unlikely to rouse anything but passing interest. (In the West, among most clinicians, the treatment would be much the same.Now Huang Wenjie discovered that the doctor and nurse who accompanied this patient from Heyuan had themselves fallen ill with this mysterious affliction and were hospitalized in critical condition.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Mayer, MD, MPH, answered your questions about new treatments and research for metastatic breast cancer and how to enhance your quality of life while living with metastatic disease. Question: If a woman with metastatic breast cancer has been only on anastrozole (Arimidex) for bone mets, when it stops working would you go to another aromatase inhibitor next or fulvestrant (Faslodex)? Dr. Mayer: For women with metastatic hormone receptor -positive breast cancer, treatment with endocrine agents is a preferable choice as these medicines can be quite effective with minimal toxicity . All of these agents are very active against metastatic breast cancer. Selecting which agent to use often depends on prior exposures—for example, did the tumor recur while the woman was taking one of these therapies and would then be considered resistant? Or, does the woman have a preference for oral versus injection therapy ? The question of exemestane versus fulvestrant has specifically been addressed in a clinical trial in which women progressing on a non-steroidal AI were randomly selected to get either exemestane or fulvestrant. Results from that study showed no difference in outcomes between the arms. Question: Would it be fair to say the research areas of greatest hope are stem cells and vaccines? Much of this work has broadened our knowledge of cancer cell biology but has not yet translated into findings with a direct impact on women and their treatment. There are many other important areas of breast cancer research as well. Therefore, your question about duration of trastuzumab is increasingly common. Unfortunately, we do not currently have data from clinical trials to guide these decisions. In practice, many of us will continue trastuzumab indefinitely in the setting of metastatic, HER2-positive disease. We also continue cardiac monitoring, often on an every 4-6 month basis. Anecdotally, there does not appear to be any long-term toxicity from extended exposure to trastuzumab. Therefore, I would suggest continuing with trastuzumab for now, and I wish you best of luck with your treatment! Occasionally there are situations when beginning therapy right away is necessary. However in the majority of situations, there is usually adequate time to learn more about the new diagnosis and visit with doctors while making a decision about how to proceed. Overall, it can be worthwhile to take time to learn about your treatment choices and become fully educated. Question: Are there any general guidelines that you give your patients regarding making decisions about treatment options once there is distant recurrence? Dr. Mayer: Many important decisions come up when faced with a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis , and no rule book tells you what’s right and what’s wrong. One of the most important things to start with is good communication with your treatment team as well as at home with your friends and family. Although the Internet is full of cancer information, you have to use it wisely and try to stay with sites that are safe and reviewed by cancer specialists. Always consider getting a second opinion if you are confused about what to do next. Your own doctor will not be offended if you visit with another specialist , and often an outside opinion can help put things in perspective. Question: I have triple-negative breast cancer. How long can someone be on paclitaxel (Abraxane) for example, or any of the other chemos? Dr. Mayer: In general, you will want to try to stay on therapies for as long as possible to get maximum benefit. Indications that it’s time to change therapies include clear evidence of cancer progression , either on a scan or because of worsening symptoms, or the development of unbearable side effects which cannot be fixed. Some chemotherapies such as doxorubicin (Adriamycin) can have increasing toxicity which can result in permanent body damage over time. Question: I have had metastatic disease since Nov. 2005. Has there been any research on liver ablation with breast cancer? I know that it is used for liver and colon cancer, but how about breast cancer? The possible benefit of liver-directed therapy in metastatic breast cancer is not well studied. Therefore it is not known if having treatment to the liver improves outcomes for these women versus continuing on with more traditional treatments such as chemotherapy . But you should feel comfortable discussing this topic in further detail with your cancer doctor. Question: I am a 9-year survivor of metastatic inflammatory breast cancer. What treatment is available today? Also, changes in heart function related to trastuzumab appear to resolve once treatment is held. Rechecking heart function would be important to do right now. It is important to review with your doctor what treatments are available to you at this time and what opportunities exist through clinical trials. Question: I have invasive lobular breast cancer which has metastasized to my bones and stomach. I started capecitabine (Xeloda) about a month ago, and it seems that it is starting to work. Close monitoring by bloodwork, visits with your treatment team for examination andperiodic radiology scans sound like a very appropriate start. Once you are settled into treatment and tolerating it well, you could consider decreasing the frequency of bloodwork to every 3-4 weeks. Dr. Mayer: In general, basic supplements, including multivitamins, calcium, and standard dose vitamin D, are fine to take during chemotherapy . Some supplements or high dose vitamins have the potential to negatively interact with traditional cancer medicines. Additionally, exposure to some supplements can irritate the liver, making it harder to safely administer chemotherapy. It is very important to report any supplements you are taking to your doctor so you can work together to ensure that taking the supplements in combination with chemotherapy is safe. My numbers are starting to creep up with the Femara, so I’m afraid my doctor is going to put me on capecitabine (Xeloda). Outside of clinical trials, women often transition to chemotherapy after finishing these endocrine therapies. Alternatively, some trials offer treatment just with an oral biologic agent without the use of chemotherapy. Therefore, you could seek out trial enrollment as a next step after progression on letrozole. Is there new intelligence out there on what our life expectancies are with all the new meds? Furthermore, the ongoing development of better therapies for metastatic breast cancer has definitely led to improvements in survival. In general, it is not possible to give updated life expectancy numbers, but we certainly hope that we continue to see more and more women living and thriving while being treated for metastatic disease. Question: What is the current treatment standard for muscle/bone/joint pain resulting from taking aromatase inhibitors during prolonged periods (e.g. However, managing this side effect can be challenging. Recommended techniques include use of non-steroidal inflammatory agents, stretching, exercise and acupuncture . Sometimes changing to another aromatase inhibitor can make a difference. Question: Is there any anticipated change(s), as a result of clinical trials or other, in future treatment for pain? Dr. Mayer: Management of cancer-related pain has improved over the past several years. One of the biggest improvements has been recognizing the need to monitor pain more closely. And because even the doctors usually can't or won't say exactly what the future will hold, you're stuck piecing together information and trying to look ahead without constantly worrying about a recurrence. It's one of the ironies of cancer. If your oncologist won't be your direct contact after treatment is completed, these are some questions to bring up at your last appointment with him or her:\n\n• Which doctor do I see and when? Since the late 19th century, medical researchers have established modern cancer care through the development of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapies, and refined surgical techniques. , only 32.9% of cancer patients in the United States died within five years of their diagnosis. Despite their effectiveness, many conventional treatments are accompanied by a wide range of side effects, including pain, fatigue, and nausea. Some side effects can even be life-threatening. Many \n\n There have always been \"many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in biomedicine. However, \"many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. The label 'unproven' is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been 'disproven'.\" Edzard Ernst has stated: \"any alternative cancer cure is bogus by definition. There will never be an alternative cancer cure. Because if something looked halfway promising, then mainstream oncology would scrutinize it, and if there is anything to it, it would become mainstream almost automatically and very quickly. All curative \"alternative cancer cures\" are based on false claims, are bogus, and, I would say, even criminal.\" The panel will include specialists from Weill Cornell Medicine and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. While everyone has heard about the rigors of and side effects than can accompany cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and many are familiar with the complications the cancer itself can pose, with today’s survival rates managing cancer can share some similarities with managing other chronic conditions. How can patients manage their cancer as a chronic disease? If you don’t know if a source is a good one, ask your doctor. Today, there are fortunately many new treatments available that we just didn’t have a few years ago. As a doctor, one of the hardest things I have to do is tell a patient they have cancer. It is a life-altering diagnosis, and most often not in a good way. When your doctor gives you the news, chances are your mind will go numb and you will forget any question you may have had when you walked into the exam room. Many patients feel exhausted going through cancer treatments. Many patients with cancer fall into depression. Cancer is one of the diseases that is the hardest to accept, and if you need support on these issues you are not alone. Even if you’ve been told your cancer is terminal and there are no cures left for you, the truth is that no one knows how long you will live. As a doctor, I have seen so many patients out-live their life expectancies, and for no obvious reason. If a doctor tells you how long he/she expects you will live, take it with a grain of salt and just go on living because it is only their “best guess”. I have heard many cancer patients say they hate when others tell them to fight their cancer or when they are told they will win over it. Most patients want to live, but the cancer will do what it will and applying extra pressure to yourself can be a burden.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Montagnier's conclusions were rejected as hasty by the scientific community, considering the gene sequences are common among similar organisms. There is no evidence indicating the novel coronavirus is a man-made virus. Characterization and complete genome sequence of a novel coronavirus, coronavirus HKU1, from patients with pneumonia. In the past 3 years, several novel respiratory viruses, including human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human coronavirus NL63, were discovered. Isolation of the virus by using various cell lines, mixed neuron-glia culture, and intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice was unsuccessful. Unconfirmed viral videos circulating on social media suggest that bystanders refused to perform CPR out of fear of the novel coronavirus. In February, it was reported a supermarket employee refused entry to customers of Asian appearance, claiming it was to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. The evidence shows that the virus might have originated from an animal coronavirus, but somehow entered the human population. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans. A previously unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a 60-year-old man who presented with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure with a fatal outcome in Saudi Arabia.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

By increasing synovial fluid levels of HA, viscosupplementation injections have been effective in reducing pain by decreasing levels of inflammatory substances called prostaglandins. It is important to note that not all patients with osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation injections. However, patients with advanced destructive osteoarthritis and chronic knee pain may not experience the same level of benefits. Please consult with a healthcare professional to determine whether viscosupplementation injections are a suitable option for your specific condition. Know what is Viscosupplementation injection for knee joint pain relief, is viscosupplementation effective, its side effects & costs, when is it recommended etc. Get clue about whether your joint pain can be treated with Viscosupplementation! For the patients of osteoarthritis who suffer from knee joint pain but do not want to go for knee replacement surgery, there is an alternative knee treatment known as Viscosupplementation. Poor lubrication due to low hyaluronic acid (HA) levels is one of such causes for osteoarthritis knee pain. Viscosupplomementation is a treatment which involves the injection of gel-like substances (hyaluronates) into the joints to supplement the viscous properties of synovial (lubricating) fluid. Viscosupplementation can also be achieved by taking oral supplements. Is Viscosupplementation Effective for Knee Joint Pain? However, not all patients of osteoarthritis benefit from viscosupplementation. Only those patients who have mild to moderate osteoarthritis have shown significant improvement in their pain condition. Those having advanced destructive osteoarthritis with chronic knee pain do not seem to have any beneficial effect from viscosupplement injections. When the patients of osteoarthritis with mild to moderate knee joint pain do not get any relief from the following traditional treatments, they are recommended by the doctors to take viscosupplementation treatment. What are the Side Effects of Viscosupplementation? The side effects of viscosupplement injections are generally mild. Viscosupplementation treatment is, till date, available for treating knee joint pains only. Watch the video on viscosupplementation treatments in India for more information on the subject. Viscosupplementation is a medical procedure used to manage pain in patients with osteoarthritis or joint injuries. Additionally, viscosupplementation is believed to slow down the progression of arthritis, which is particularly beneficial for patients with osteoarthritis. Viscosupplementation can be used as an alternative to knee surgery for some patients, while others rely on these injections to manage chronic pain caused by an injury or osteoarthritis. It is a minimally invasive procedure that can potentially \"save\" the affected joint from further deterioration and help patients avoid surgery. In summary, viscosupplementation is a procedure that adds lubrication to the joint, restores movement, minimizes pain, and slows the progression of arthritis.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In each case, the medical research team began by taking a small sample of genital tissue from the teenager's vulva. The sample was used as a seed to grow additional tissue in the lab which was then placed in a vaginal shaped, biodegradable mold. Commentary published by the National Health Service (NHS) called the study \"an important proof of concept\" and said it showed that tissue engineering had \"a great deal of potential.\" While it can be playful and fun to have nicknames for your vulva or vagina, when it comes down to it, you should know the real deal.Knowing what your girl parts are called contributes to ownership and understanding your body as well as better control over your medical care and sexual health.You should know that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) challenges the claim that the surgery can restore sensitivity. Whether you are pro plasty or against it, it's important to remember that everyone is different. The shot is basically platelet-rich plasma extracted from your own blood, then injected into your clitoris and vagina. Your internal and external anatomy is impressively designed to serve a range of functions from pleasure to reproduction, and knowing where the parts are and how they work puts you in charge of your sexual and reproductive self. Five to six weeks later, the structure was implanted into the patients, where the tissue continued to grow and connected with the girls' circulatory and other bodily systems. After about eight years, all four patients reported normal function and pleasure levels during sexual intercourse according to the Female Sexual Function Index questionnaire, a validated self-report tool. In two of the four women, the vagina was attached to the uterus, making pregnancy possible. Martin Birchall, who works on tissue engineering, but was not involved in\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

This study describes parenthood after heart transplantation in the New Zealand population. Exclusion criteria were death within 3 months of transplantation or age <18 years at the time of the survey. Recipients (or next of kin if recipients deceased) were surveyed regarding family status at the time of transplantation and new parenthood after transplantation. Before transplantation, 81% were in a permanent relationship; 72% had children. After transplantation, 19/45 recipients had 27 children (2 female recipients had 3 children), of whom 15 were planned. This study provides unique data relevant to both female and male recipients regarding new parenthood after heart transplantation and will promote more informed discussion with transplant recipients. A heart transplant is a surgical transplantation that is performed on patients with end-stage heart failure, or severe coronary artery disease. When is Heart Transplant Performed? There are always some risks involved when undergoing a heart transplant surgery or any other surgery for that matter. It occurs when the donor’s heart fails and stops working. If all organs are in healthy condition and the recipient is free from cancer or other infections, then the patient is screened further. Recipients who smoke, or drink in excess, or have chronic diabetes are often ruled out from a heart transplant. Once the recipient is found fit, their name is sent to the donor waiting list across the country. It is difficult to predict how long a patient will have to wait for the donor’s heart. There is no order to the waiting list and recipients are matched with donors according to the best match possible. While the patient waits for the donor’s heart, it is imperative to take optimum care of the health. A heart transplant doctor will conduct the surgery as soon as a donor’s heart is available for the recipient. When the recipient is notified, they must immediately act for a heart transplant surgery. Once the blood starts flowing in the body through the heart-lung machine, the recipient’s heart is removed, and the donor’s heart is sewn inside the body. Emotional Support –Once a heart transplant surgery is successful, the patient might need a whole new lease on life through emotional support. It is necessary to contain this overwhelming state which a patient is more likely to feel after a heart transplant. David Vetter, the original \"bubble boy\", had one of the first transplantations also, but eventually died because of an unscreened virus, Epstein-Barr (tests were not available at the time), in his newly transplanted bone marrow from his sister, an unmatched bone marrow donor. Physicians have also had some success with in utero transplants done before the child is born and also by using cord blood which is rich in stem cells. In utero transplants allow for the fetus to develop a functional immune system in the sterile environment of the uterus; however complications such as GVHD would be \n\nThomas Middleditch as Drew, a divorced father and therapist in need of a kidney transplant and a social life ; Annaleigh Ashford as Gina, a former acquaintance of Drew's from high school who becomes his kidney donor, as her blood is an incredibly rare match for his. ; Kether Donohue as Gabby, Gina's best friend, a party girl who works with her in the Valley Hills assisted living facility ; Sara Rue as Julia, Drew's ex-wife, a realtor who aspires to \n\nDuring a heart transplantation, the new heart is connected to the recipient's body through a surgical procedure.

These findings provide further evidence of the drug's potential in preventing fracture risk. By inhibiting RANK Ligand and reducing osteoclast activity, it helps prevent bone loss and supports bone mineralization. The convenience of its twice-yearly injection also adds to its appeal as a treatment option for patients at high risk of fractures. DRUGS TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS\n\nTraditional HRT regimens have largely fallen from favor because of the increased risks of heart attack, stroke, and breast cancer demonstrated by the Women's Health Initiative study. Drugs such as these are valuable therapies for women at extreme risk for, or already suffering from, osteoporosis. The drugs are also helpful in preventing bone loss in women who cannot take estrogen, such as those with or at risk of breast cancer. However, I consider these drugs to be inappropriate for routine preventive use, especially when there are natural alternatives. After initial reports that warfarin could reduce bone mineral density, several studies demonstrated a link between warfarin use and osteoporosis-related fracture. A 2002 study looking at a randomly selected selection of 1,523 patients with osteoporotic fracture found no increased exposure to anticoagulants compared to controls, and neither did stratification of the duration of anticoagulation reveal a trend towards fracture. A 2006 retrospective study of 14,564 Medicare recipients showed that warfarin use for more than one year was linked with a 60% increased risk of osteoporosis-related fracture in men; there was no association in women. The mechanism was thought to be a combination of reduced intake of vitamin K (a vitamin necessary for bone health) and inhibition by warfarin of vitamin K-mediated carboxylation of certain bone proteins, rendering them nonfunctional. What risk factors does this patient have for osteopenia and osteoporosis? What health teaching might this patient need? ### Community-Based Care\n\nPatients with osteoporosis are usually managed at home. Osteoporosis disease-management programs managed by nurse practitioners have helped diagnose and treat the disease. In any setting, assess for risk factors for osteoporosis and provide health teaching as appropriate. The patient with osteoporosis who has one or more fractures may be discharged to the home setting. Chapter 54 discusses continuing care for patients who have fractures.The Osteoporosis Society of Canada (www.osteoporosis.ca) has similar services.Large hospitals often have osteoporosis specialty clinics and support groups for patients with osteoporosis.## Osteomalacia\n\n### Pathophysiology\n\n**Osteomalacia** is loss of bone related to a vitamin D deficiency. Reports have surfaced of these drugs causing esophageal cancer, heart damage, muscle pain, and other complications.Some have even been found to be dangerous.Ironically, the medications used to treat osteoporosis are not as effective as the drug manufacturers lead you to believe.More people with diagnosed osteoporosis equal more money to be made.Fiber acts like a sponge in your body. When this process appears to be accelerated, one of two diagnoses is made: osteopenia or osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a crippling disease that increases your risk of bone fractures. Pain, disability, diminished quality of life, and—with hip fractures—increased risk of mortality are all potential complications of osteoporosis. Clinically diagnosed osteoporosis is similar between strict plant eaters and omnivores; abstaining from animal products doesn't increase risk of osteoporosis. Claims of osteoporosis becoming epidemic have made headline news recently. For the pharmaceutical, medical, supplement, and food industries, tremendous financial opportunities can be gained with medical tests, medications, supplements, and dairy products. More people with diagnosed osteoporosis equal more money to be made. Ironically, the medications used to treat osteoporosis are not as effective as the drug manufacturers lead you to believe.

LED bulbs, including LED retro types, are much more energy-efficient than any incandescent lighting. VHO fluorescent lamps run at higher power levels, usually about three times the standard wattage for a given bulb length. PC lighting is also high-power fluorescent lighting, but the tubes are thinner and are often folded over one another to reduce size. Most spiral-shaped energy-efficient light bulbs commercially available for house lighting are power compact fluorescent bulbs. Unlike an incandescent lamp controlled by a dimmer, each of the filaments operates at full voltage, so the color of the light does not change between the three steps of light available. Certain compact fluorescent lamp bulbs are designed to replace 3-way incandescent bulbs, and have an extra contact and circuitry to bring about similar light level. In recent years, LED three way bulbs have become available as well. The reproductions were sold mostly to collectors and prop houses until the turn of the 21st century, when new regulations banned low-efficiency lighting in many countries. Domestic lighting shifted toward more efficient compact fluorescent lamps and LED lights, and demand for vintage bulbs increased likewise Edison-style incandescent lamps are exempted \n\n Democrats have supported increased domestic renewable energy development, including wind and solar power farms, in an effort to reduce carbon pollution.

The chemical make-up and bubbles of Coca-Cola have been found to have a similar effect to gastric acid, helping to break down and dissolve the blockage. The success rate of using Coca-Cola to treat gastric phytobezoar has been reported to be over 90%. In the study, out of 46 patients with this condition, half of them had the blockage completely destroyed by Coca-Cola, and 19 patients only required non-invasive treatments afterwards. The researchers concluded that Coca-Cola administration is a cheap, easy-to-perform, and safe procedure that can be done at any endoscopy unit.

Furthermore, appropriate economic incentives could persuade pharmaceutical companies to invest in this endeavor. In the US, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act was introduced with the aim of fast tracking the drug development of antibiotics to combat \n\n growing threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals treating life-threatening infections based on smaller clinical trials. The CDC will monitor the use of antibiotics and the emerging resistance, and publish the data. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints', will provide accurate data to healthcare professionals. According to Allan Coukell, senior director for health programs at The Pew Charitable Trusts, \"By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.\" In the United States, drug companies and the administration of President Barack Obama had been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms. On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order to implement the recommendations proposed in a report by the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&D of new antibiotics.

Some treatment options for enlarged prostate include alpha-blockers, which help relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck to improve urine flow. Another type of drug used to treat enlarged prostate is a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor. These drugs are designed to shrink the prostate gland by decreasing the amount of DHT in the body. However, they may take three to six months to effectively relieve symptoms and can have side effects such as an inability to achieve an erection, decreased sexual desire, and a reduced amount of semen. In addition to medication, there are several conventional treatment options for enlarged prostate. Microwave and heat therapies use microwave or heat energy to reduce symptoms. It's important to note that while surgery can effectively address urination problems caused by an enlarged prostate, it may also have an impact on sexual function. Nerves passing along the prostate are at risk of being cut during surgery, which can potentially lead to a loss of sexual function. Those with severe/progressive symptoms or those who do not experience symptom relief from medication have traditionally been considered for surgical intervention, with transurethral resection of the prostate or TURP as the standard of care. However, there are problems with both medical and surgical treatments, including undesired side effects and variable effectiveness. For example, sexual dysfunction and orthostatic hypotension are side effects of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors. These include tamsulosin to relax smooth muscles in the bladder neck, and finasteride and dutasteride to decrease prostate enlargement. The drugs only work for mild cases of BPH but also have mild side effects. There are many treatment options for enlarged prostates and prostate cancer that can return men to normal healthy lives. These include the use of monoclonal antibodies for detecting cancer outside of the prostate and the use of various advances in technology to treat non-cancerous prostatic enlargement. The department has an ongoing prostate research project with treatment discovery that may have a major impact on the spread of prostate cancer to other organs. Edinburg Regional Medical Center has extensive experience with nerve-sparing prostate surgery. Results with preserving continence and erectile function compare favorably with other academic centers performing the operation. The dose of each seed is customized at the time of surgery to conform to the size of the individual prostate gland. This method eliminates the staging procedure and is associated with the best response rates for brachytherapy. A new microwave thermotherapy is available to reduce the prostate without standard anesthesia. Other treatment options to relieve symptoms include medical therapies, minimally invasive therapies and surgical techniques. A special clinic is dedicated to the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction, patient education, selection of treatment options and long-term follow-up evaluations. Overall, while EES may still have some side effects in men undergoing prostate cancer treatment including cardiovascular complications, it appears to have considerably reduced cardiovascular side effects relative to EE when used as high-dose estrogen therapy.

In September 2020, Monash University Professor of Diabetes Paul Zimmet claimed that the switch to daylight saving time caused an increase in heart attacks, road accidents, workplace accidents, and cognitive dysfunction, and could amplify the health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, Premier of Victoria Daniel Andrews responded that daylight saving would be part of the forthcoming summer season. Daylight saving was widely believed to be introduced as a consumer spending initiative by local councils and tourism boards throughout New South Wales. Switching permanently to daylight saving time, especially in relation to delaying school start times, can have potential negative effects on individuals. While delaying school start times can have various benefits, such as allowing students to get more sleep and aligning with their natural circadian rhythm, switching to permanent daylight saving time could negate these advantages. However, when the clock time is changed abruptly, such as during the transition to daylight saving time, it can lead to confusion and an imbalance in the body's biological time. While delaying school start times may improve students' alertness and overall well-being, the shift to permanent daylight saving time could introduce new challenges. Moreover, the discrepancy between biological time and clock time caused by permanent daylight saving time can also have implications for physical health. In conclusion, while delaying school start times can have benefits for students, permanently switching to daylight saving time may counteract these advantages. The disruption of circadian rhythms and its effects on sleep patterns, academic performance, and overall health should be carefully considered when making decisions regarding school start times and daylight saving time. Just a few days ago, we turned our clocks ahead as it’s time to “spring forward” into daylight savings time. We love seeing more sunshine, but did you know that the time change might make you more likely to have a heart attack? Why might more people have heart attacks with the time change? Minutes matter with a heart attack. Daylight saving time in the Americas is the arrangement in the Americas by which clocks are advanced by one hour in spring and moved back in autumn, to make the most of seasonal daylight. Daylight saving time can potentially impact the clinical laboratory in terms of turnaround time and time combinations. According to a study analyzing data from an academic medical center clinical laboratory, the only significant impact on turnaround time was observed for clinical chemistry samples during the autumn daylight saving time change. In terms of time combinations, the study found that there were four instances of absurd time combinations during the autumn time change. Over a 5-year period, other challenges resulting from daylight saving time changes included problems with reestablishing interfaces to instruments, inadvertent discrepancies in manual time changes at different points of the core laboratory automation line, and time change errors in instruments with older operating systems lacking patches that updated daylight saving time rules after 2007. While these issues are relatively rare, it is important for clinical laboratories to be aware that problems may occur due to issues with daylight saving time changes.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A new global guideline on chronic urticaria (CU) recommends Xolair® (omalizumab), indicated as add-on therapy for the treatment of chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), for patients who are not responding to antihistamines,. Xolair is the only licensed treatment option for CSU, a type of CU, for patients unresponsive to antihistamines. The guideline recommends Xolair as the only treatment qualified with very good efficacy and very good safety in CSU. Marcus Maurer, MD, Professor of Dermatology and Allergy and Director of Research at the Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Allergie-Centrum-Charité of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, Germany said: \"I highly welcome the new guideline, as it brings greater public awareness of the disease and treatment. \"This guideline is encouraging news for CSU patients who have difficult to control symptoms,\" said Shreeram Aradhye MD, Chief Medical Officer and Global Head Medical Affairs, Novartis Pharmaceuticals. \"The recommendation reinforces the important role of Xolair to provide effective symptom control in CSU when antihistamines prove inadequate. Xolair is the only biologic shown to be effective in CSU.\" Patients treated with Xolair for 12 weeks experienced significant improvements in quality of life by 78% (vs placebo 44%, p<0.0001) as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). In addition, data show that almost 90% of CSU patients who responded well to initial Xolair treatment regained symptom control within 12 weeks of Xolair retreatment following a treatment interruption, based on Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) criteria (UAS7<=6). Also, Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma. Xolair is a targeted therapy that binds to immunoglobulin E (IgE). In allergic diseases and asthma, the binding of IgE by Xolair reduces symptoms by suppressing multiple cell activation mechanisms, including some that result in histamine release. Research is ongoing to better understand the mechanism of action of Xolair in CSU, which could lead to a deeper understanding of how the disease develops. Xolair is approved for the treatment of CSU in over 80 countries including the European Union and for chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as it is known in the US and Canada. Xolair is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe or severe persistent allergic asthma in more than 90 countries, including the US since 2003 and the EU since 2005 and has over 800,000 patient years of exposure. In the US, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Genentech, Inc. work together to develop and co-promote Xolair. Novartis is a global leader in Immunology & Dermatology. Other key brands include Xolair® (omalizumab) in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU), Zortress®/Certican® (everolimus) and Myfortic® (mycophenolic acid) in transplant and Ilaris® (canakinumab), approved to treat several rare diseases including some Periodic Fever Syndromes.

Nearly 50 Percent of Patients Have Inadequate Response to H1-antihistamines, Previously the Only Approved Therapy for CIU3. Genentech, a member of the Roche Group (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY), today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Xolair(R) (omalizumab) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), a form of chronic hives. The new use is for people 12 years of age and older who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Until now, H(1) -antihistamines have been the only approved therapy for CIU, with about 50 percent of patients having an inadequate response(3) . Xolair is the first biologic medicine and first medicine approved by the FDA for CIU since non-sedating H(1) -antihistamines. Xolair is approved for people 12 years and older with CIU who remain symptomatic despite treatment with H(1) -antihistamine therapy(5) . Xolair is not used to treat other forms of urticaria (hives) and is not for use in children less than 12 years of age. It is jointly developed by Genentech and Novartis Pharma AG and is co-promoted in the U.S. with Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. The efficacy and safety profile of Xolair for the treatment of CIU was evaluated in two clinical studies called ASTERIA I and ASTERIA II(5) . In these studies, patients 12 to 75 years old received doses of Xolair at 150 mg, 300 mg or placebo(5) . Xolair or placebo was given every four weeks for 24 weeks (ASTERIA I) and 12 weeks (ASTERIA II). In addition, patients continued to receive H(1) -antihistamine medicines they had been taking for CIU before starting treatment with Xolair(5) . The efficacy of Xolair in patients 12 years and older who remained symptomatic despite taking H(1) -antihistamines was assessed using a scale known as the average (mean) weekly Itch Severity Score (ISS) at Week 12. In ASTERIA I, Xolair 150 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 47 percent (-6.7) and Xolair 300 mg improved ISS from the starting measurement by 66 percent (-9.4) at Week 12, compared to a 25 percent (-3.6) score improvement for patients who received placebo(5) . Also, a larger proportion of patients (36 percent) treated with Xolair 300 mg reported no itch and no hives at Week 12, compared to patients treated with Xolair 150 mg (15 percent), and patients in the placebo group (9 percent)(5) . The most common side effects in patients treated with Xolair were nausea, headaches, swelling of the inside of the nose, throat or sinuses, cough, joint pain, and upper respiratory tract infection(5) . moderate to severe persistent allergic asthma who have had a skin or blood test that is positive for allergic asthma and whose asthma symptoms are not controlled by asthma medicines called inhaled corticosteroids. chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU; chronic hives without a known cause) who continue to have hives that are not controlled by H1-antihistamine treatment. Xolair is not used to treat other allergic conditions, other forms of urticaria (hives), acute bronchospasm (serious and sudden breathing problems) or status asthmaticus (acute, severe, prolonged asthma attack that can be life threatening).

It is aimed at stimulating resistance to respiratory syncytial virus infection, targeting both adult and infant populations. 2016 saw the company's first phase III trial, the 12,000 adult Resolve trial, for its respiratory syncytial virus vaccine, which would come to be known as ResVax, fail in September. Evaluation of \n\nA drug already used to treat moderate-to-severe allergic asthma appears to offer relief to people with chronic hives who haven't been helped by standard medications, new research suggests. The prescription drug -- omalizumab (Xolair) -- is already available to treat hives, following U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval earlier this year for that use. \"And until now antihistamines have been the only approved drug for chronic hives. But to work, antihistamines often need to be used at up to four times approved levels, which has a sedating effect. So then we would turn to the heavy artillery, like [the immunosuppressant drug] cyclosporine, which also has very severe side effects, and can't be taken by people with high blood pressure or heart disease.\" \"All this means that many, many patients have simply been left without any treatment,\" she noted. \"But with this drug we are seeing great improvement in patients who previously had no options. The current study is the latest in a series of ongoing studies, which are being funded by drug manufacturer Genentech Inc. and Novartis Pharma AG in Basel Switzerland. The team found that by the 12th week, people given Xolair showed a marked reduction in their overall number of hives, hive intensity and itching severity, compared with patients who got the dummy treatment. Symptom relief was maintained through the six-month mark, and the authors determined that those treated with the highest (300 mg) dosage of Xolair saw the biggest improvement.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The drug, named Epidiolex, utilizes cannabidiol (CBD) derived from cannabis plants. Tilray Canada has launched its newest product, Tilray 2:100, a formulation of therapeutic cannabis oil containing a high concentration of cannabidiol (CBD), which may help treat Canadian patients with conditions like Dravet syndrome. “We are excited to offer this highly concentrated CBD product to patients in Canada. Tilray 2:100 contains the same target concentration of CBD and THC as an investigational treatment being tested in a current open-label Phase 1 clinical trial (NCT02983695) on pediatric epilepsy, taking place in Toronto. Supported by Tilray, the trial is determining the tolerability and optimal dose of a CBD-rich cannabis extract (TIL-TC150) as an adjunct treatment in children with severe therapy-resistant epilepsy due to Dravet syndrome. One of these therapies is Epidiolex (GWP42003-P), an investigative, oral cannabidiol solution developed by GW Pharmaceuticals. Scientists are still investigating how cannabidiol works to relieve epilepsy and hypothesize it may be due to its ability to interact with non-cannabinoid receptors in the brain – our brains have a natural endocannabinoid system with receptors that respond to CBD and THC. In April 2018, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory committee recommended approval of Epidiolex as a treatment for two rare forms of severe epilepsy — Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. An FDA approval would make Epidiolex the first-ever approved treatment for Dravet in the country, as well as the first plant-derived cannabidiol medicine of any kind approved for prescription use in the United States. Tagged Canada, cannabidiol, CBD, children with epilepsy, high-CBD cannabis oil, medical cannabis, Tilray 2:100, Tilray Canada. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine has shown a significant reduction of seizures in patients taking 10 and 20 mg/kg a day compared to placebo. The UK government recognises that cannabis-based medicines could benefit children with epilepsy, but more robust effectiveness and safety data are required before the products can become widely available. Cannabis sativa has been domesticated and cultivated by humans over millennia for its fibre, oils and psychoactive properties; throughout history, the resin, leaves and flowers of the plant have been described as having therapeutic activity. In Ayurvedic and Chinese texts, cannabinoids — the plant’s natural components — were recommended for the treatment of seizures. The effectiveness of hashish in treating a child with a convulsive disorder was described by physician William Brooke O’Shaughnessy in the 1840s, following observations made in Bengal. reported anticonvulsant benefits in a phase I trial of cannabidiol (CBD) — the plant’s most commonly identified non-intoxicating cannabinoid. Over the past few years, several trials have reported that the safety profile of CBD justifies randomised trials in patients with epilepsy who do not respond to conventional strategies. In 2017, a multicentre international trial randomised 120 children and young adults with Dravet syndrome in a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment trial with oral CBD or placebo. The overall condition of patients in the active treatment group improved on a global assessment scale and while 5% of cases became seizure-free in the active treatment group, there were no seizure-free patients in the placebo arm. The literature suggests that patients with other treatment-resistant epileptic encephalopathies, such as CDKL5 deficiency disorder, Aicardi syndrome, Dup15q, Doose and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes, respond positively to CBD treatment,. This growing body of evidence suggests that treatment with CBD at recommended doses is safe. CBD may also be beneficial in treating patients with other conditions. The compound is claimed to be effective in alleviating neuropathic pain, reducing muscle spasms and treating the nausea associated with chemotherapy. CBD may be used to reduce blood pressure or treat glaucoma and it may alleviate symptoms of asthma, depression, insomnia and constipation. In June 2018, the case of 12-year-old British boy Billy Caldwell — whose mother tried to bring home a cannabis oil from Canada to treat Billy’s epilepsy — brought to the fore a national debate on how families should be able to access cannabis-based preparations to treat their children. As the Caldwell story unfolded, the US Food and Drug Administration licensed the first cannabis-derived medicine — Epidiolex (GW Pharmaceuticals) — for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome in children aged over two years. And, in other countries, pharmaceutical-grade cannabinoid medicines that contain more than 50% THC are already available, such as Sativex (Bayer) for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Following a review of the evidence by the UK Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, recommended that the “whole class of cannabis-based medicinal products be moved out of Schedule 1” and that doctors should be able to prescribe them. In the event of cannabis-based products becoming available for prescription, pharmacists will require considerably more information relating to the safety, adverse effects and drug interactions of THC if they are to develop their role as educators and communicators of the products. But clinical data relating to therapies containing THC are currently not as robust or as well founded as that to support CBD. Also, the relative efficacies of CBD as part of combination therapies have not yet been published. However, adverse events with CBD, including raised transaminases and several drug interactions, are reported as being well tolerated in patients. Or might we find ways of manipulating the body’s endocannabinoid system with other agents? Long-term effects of CBD on the brains of children with epilepsy have not been studied, although if CBD reduces seizures, any risk–benefit ratio is likely to be strongly in favour of its use. The scientific and ethical arguments are not yet transferable to botanical preparations containing more than 0.2% THC, owing to the current lack of published good quality evidence. But cannabis could prove itself to be a botanical treasure trove offering great potential for innovative new therapies for many complaints, not just seizures. Natural products have often led to transformative approaches to healthcare and, with investment in collecting safety and dosing data, Cannabis sativa could do the same. Chronic administration of cannabidiol to healthy volunteers and epileptic patients. Cannabidiol in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy: an open-label interventional trial. Trial of cannabidiol for drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome. Open-label use of highly* purified CBD (Epidiolex®) in patients with CDKL5 deficiency disorder and Aicardi, Dup15q, and Doose syndromes. Perceived efficacy of cannabidiol-enriched cannabis extracts for treatment of pediatric epilepsy: a potential role for infantile spasms and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Cannabis-based medicines for chronic neuropathic pain in adults. Interactions between cannabidiol and commonly used antiepileptic drugs. The findings of the study suggest that cannabidiol may be a promising treatment strategy for LGS. The compound more than halved the frequency of atonic seizures in patients with LGS, indicating its potential effectiveness in managing this severe form of epilepsy. It has been the subject of various studies that have explored its therapeutic potential. Apart from its potential for epilepsy treatment, cannabidiol has also been linked to reductions in anxiety and improvements in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and other mental health conditions. The specific mechanisms through which cannabidiol exerts its antiseizure effects are still being investigated. In conclusion, the researchers from the Ohio State University found that cannabidiol showed promise in reducing the frequency of atonic seizures in individuals with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The patient's symptoms prompted his doctor to tell him to go to the emergency room for a CT scan. While at the hospital the patient developed a fever, shortness of breath, and diarrhea. His CT scan revealed he had pneumonia, and shading in one lung gave doctors reason to believe he could have the coronavirus. On March 4, Governor Phil Murphy and Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver announced the state's first case of COVID-19, a presumptive positive test result in a man in his 30s who had been hospitalized in Bergen County since March 3.

Managing Oncology Services During a Major Coronavirus Outbreak: Lessons From the Saudi Arabia Experience. This article describes the approach used to manage patients with cancer during a large-scale Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus hospital outbreak in Saudi Arabia to ensure continuity of care and minimize harm from treatment interruption or acquiring infection. Although human coronaviruses (CoVs) had been known as major pathogens to cause the common cold, a new species of coronavirus, namely SARS-CoV caused an epidemic involving 29 countries during 2002–03 which infected 8098 persons and killed 774 of them. Its outbreak also implies that animal coronaviruses could be a potential danger to humans.

In the only election debate he attended, where he joined Democrat James Thompson, and the campaign manager for Libertarian candidate Chris Rockhold, he repeated the claim that Planned Parenthood had been profiting by selling parts of aborted fetuses. More than a dozen investigations were launched by outraged conservative lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in the states.Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts.The law stipulates that abortion clinics can be reimbursed only for costs when they provide fetal tissue for research. For some, the use of cells from Mrs. X's fetus will continue to be an abomination, no matter how long ago the abortion was and no matter that it would have happened anyway. In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives. They showed senior physicians from the women's health provider Planned Parenthood discussing how they performed abortions and provided fetal tissue for medical research. Daleiden's videos purported to show Planned Parenthood trafficking illegally, for profit, in fetal body parts. Kaplan has criticized conservative politicians who attempted to defund Planned Parenthood for allowing women to donate their embryos to medical research, but not targeting fertility clinics that, according to her, allow women to do exactly the same thing. The paper, published in JAMA Cardiology, found that the rate of abortion for babies with major congenital heart disease (CHD) increased from 0.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2013 – a 65 fold increase. The rate is particularly high for some conditions – in the case of fetuses diagnosed with single ventricle defects (such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the most severe form of CHD), roughly 85% of pregnancies ended in abortion. The last statement by Dr. Kon, that women who are not white may get more pressure to commit infanticide, is yet another evidence that indicates that eugenics never went away, but really is stronger today than it ever has been. Back in the first half of the 20th century, they were not pushing women to have abortions, but they were sterilizing people — which is still evil. Today, there is an entire international eugenics complex that is profiting from the advocation and committing of infanticide, and there is a specific targeting of minority children, or unborn children who are not white, to have them slaughtered through the consent of their own mothers, and by the hand of Social-Darwinist doctors. Last year, Planned Parenthood Southeast president, Staci Fox, admitted that the majority of the babies slaughtered in Planned Parenthood offices are minority babies. So Planned Parenthood specifically targets minorities to murder their children because it wants to eradicate their populations. There are numerous operatives who present themselves as “liberal” and as “against racism” while they lobby for Planned Parenthood. For example, Tim Wise, a Jewish American ‘anti-racist’ operative, will say many things against racism, but he will defend Planned Parenthood. But both back eugenics, while using their words against racism and Islam as a way to cover up their true motivations. While people like Ben Shapiro, Frank Gaffney, Daniel Pipes, and Robert Spencer all are part of the Counter-jihad crown, they both have pushed for policies that back the jihad. Ultimately their pursuit is the wants and desires of the antichrist. None of the investigations have found evidence that Planned Parenthood profited by providing fetal tissue for research—although Daleiden was indicted by a Texas grand jury on a felony charge of tampering with a government record, for creating a false driver's license to mask his real identity.In the summer of 2015 David Daleiden, an antiabortion activist who founded an organization that he calls the Center for Medical Progress, released covertly filmed, heavily edited videos in which he and a colleague posed as biotechnology company executives.

Re-acquired rights to AV-203, AVEO’s ErbB3 inhibitor, from Biogen Idec in March 2014. By re-acquiring these rights, AVEO will be able to seek a partner with established oncology capabilities to accelerate and financially support the clinical development of this asset. Executed an agreement with Biodesix in April 2014 under which AVEO plans to conduct a proof of concept study of ficlatuzumab in combination with erlotinib in advanced non-small cell lung cancer using Biodesix’s VeriStrat® test to select for a patient population which did not respond well to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, but responded to the combination therapy in an exploratory analysis of AVEO’s Phase 2 trial data. Biodesix will fund up to $15 million of the cost of the study. Any additional development, regulatory and commercial costs for ficlatuzumab beyond the proof of concept study will be shared equally between AVEO and Biodesix, as will any potential profits. AVEO and Astellas announced the termination of their tivozanib collaboration pursuant to which Astellas will return all rights for tivozanib to AVEO in August 2014. At that time AVEO plans to explore potential partnership opportunities to support the further clinical development of tivozanib. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to a reduction in personnel-related expenses following AVEO’s June 2013 strategic restructuring as well as a decrease in external clinical trial, consulting, and manufacturing costs associated with development and pre-commercialization activities for tivozanib. The decrease in G&A expense was primarily due to a reduction in personnel-related expenses following the company’s June 2013 strategic restructuring and a decrease in marketing and consulting costs for tivozanib related to pre-commercialization activities. AVEO’s Phase 1 dose-escalation study of AV-203 has been accepted for a poster presentation at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology in June. AVEO expects to present at the 2014 Jefferies Healthcare Conference, June 2-5 in New York City.

Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that AVEO makes due to a number of important factors, including risks relating to: AVEO’s ability to execute on its business plan and re-align its resources behind key development opportunities; AVEO’s ability to successfully enroll and complete clinical trials and preclinical studies of its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, the safety, efficacy and clinically meaningful benefit of its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for intellectual property rights relating to its product candidates and technologies; developments and expenses related to AVEO’s ongoing shareholder litigation and SEC inquiry; AVEO’s ability to raise the substantial additional funds required to achieve its goals; adverse general economic and industry conditions; competitive factors; AVEO’s ability to maintain its strategic partnerships and relationships, such as the collaboration with Biodesix described in this press release; and those risks discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in AVEO’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in its other filings with the SEC. AVEO anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its views to change. CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AVEO Oncology (NASDAQ:AVEO) today announced the presentation of data from the Phase 3 TIVO-3 study of tivozanib (FOTIVDA®) versus sorafenib in refractory advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The data were presented by Brian Rini, MD, Professor of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University, and Director, Cleveland Clinic Genitourinary Cancer Program, during an oral presentation titled, “TIVO-3: A Phase 3, Randomized, Controlled, Multi-Center, Open-Label Study to Compare Tivozanib to Sorafenib in Subjects with Refractory Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)” at the 2019 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Genitourinary (GU) Cancers Symposium held February 14-16, 2019 in San Francisco. The TIVO-3 trial enrolled patients with RCC who have failed at least two prior regimens. Among these, approximately 26% of patients received checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy in earlier lines of treatment. Patients who received prior CPI therapy had a median PFS of 7.3 months with tivozanib and 5.1 months with sorafenib (HR=0.55, p=0.03, see Figure 2). Median duration of response (DOR) in patients receiving tivozanib was not reached (95% CI:12.9,---) and was 5.7 months for patients receiving sorafenib (95% CI:5.6,---). DOR probability at 1 year was 71% and 46% for tivozanib and sorafenib, respectively, and 55% and 0% at two years. The analysis of the secondary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not mature at the time of the final PFS analysis, and currently reflects ~50% of potential OS events. As previously disclosed, the updated preliminary OS analysis conducted at an October 4, 2018 data cutoff date, which included additional patients previously lost to follow-up, showed a non-statistically significant difference in OS favoring sorafenib (HR=1.12, p=0.44). AVEO Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the “Company” or “AVEO”) is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to advancing a broad portfolio of targeted medicines for oncology and other areas of unmet medical need. The Company has entered into partnerships for the development and commercialization of AV-203 (CAN017) and ficlatuzumab, both clinical stage assets in oncology. The Company has recently regained the rights to its AV-380 program for the potential treatment of cachexia and is initiating toxicology studies to support the filing of an initial new drug application and advance the program’s development. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about: AVEO’s plans to make a NDA filing decision following the availability of more mature OS results; AVEO’s plans to complete an interim OS analysis for the TIVO-3 trial in August 2019 and to report the results of this analysis in the fourth quarter; AVEO’s plans to present TIVO-3 data at ASCO GU; AVEO’s expectation that the OS outcome will be more mature by August 2019; AVEO’s hope that the positive PFS outcome will translate into an improved hazard ratio; AVEO’s intent to continue to work with the FDA to determine tivozanib’s risk-benefit profile as a single agent in RCC; the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tivozanib, as a single agent and in combination with other therapies in several indications, such as RCC and HCC; AVEO’s plans and strategies for commercialization of tivozanib in the United States and Europe; AVEO’s plans to develop the AV-353 platform; AVEO’s plans regarding AV-380 and AVEO’s other strategy, prospects, plans and objectives for its product candidates and for the Company generally. AVEO has based its expectations and estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these expectations and estimates. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that AVEO makes due to a number of important factors, including risks relating to: AVEO’s ability, and the ability of its licensees, to demonstrate to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory agencies such as the FDA the safety, efficacy and clinically meaningful benefit of AVEO’s product candidates, including, in particular, tivozanib; AVEO’s ability to successfully file an NDA for tivozanib; and AVEO’s ability to enter into and maintain its third party collaboration and license agreements, and its ability, and the ability of its strategic partners, to achieve development and commercialization objectives under these arrangements. CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 5, 2014-- AVEO Oncology (NASDAQ:AVEO) today reported its third quarter 2014 financial results and provided an overview of its progress toward achieving its strategic plan. AV-380 – At the 2ndCancer Cachexia Conference in September, AVEO presented results from four preclinical studies of AV-380, the Company’s potent, humanized inhibitory antibody targeting growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), in various in vivo cachexia models and in vitro assays. AVEO is progressing AV-380 toward clinical study, which is expected to begin in the second half of 2015. The Company is also actively pursuing partnerships to realize the full potential of AV-380 within and beyond cancer cachexia. Ficlatuzumab – At the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2014 Congress, AVEO and Biodesix presented results from a retrospective exploratory analysis using VeriStrat®, a commercially available serum protein test, to identify patients most likely to benefit from the addition of ficlatuzumab, AVEO’s potent hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibitory antibody, to gefitinib (IRESSA®), an EGFR TKI therapy, in a randomized Phase 2 study in previously untreated Asian subjects with NSCLC. The results suggested that VeriStrat may be used to more precisely classify the response of a subset of NSCLC patients who, based on EGFR mutation status, should be candidates for an EGFR inhibitor yet appear not to respond to the erlotinib mono-therapy without the addition of ficlatuzumab. AVEO and Biodesix plan to conduct a confirmatory Phase 2 study using a Biodesix VeriStrat “Poor” classification as a selective biomarker for the combination of ficlatuzumab and an EGFR TKI, versus an EGFR TKI alone, in previously untreated, EGFR mutation-positive patients with NSCLC. The study is expected to be initiated before year-end. Tivozanib – At the ESMO 2014 Congress, AVEO presented posters highlighting results from two Phase 2 clinical studies of tivozanib, the Company’s inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1, 2, and 3 receptors, in patients with advanced colorectal and kidney cancers. The study was discontinued following a prespecified interim futility analysis for superiority. AVEO remains encouraged by the clinical outcomes from its Phase 2 studies and believes these data suggest potential avenues for the development of tivozanib as an oral, potent, and selective VEGF inhibitor. AV-203 – At the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2014 Annual Meeting, AVEO presented results from a first-in-human Phase 1 study of AV-203, the Company’s potent, high-affinity ErbB3 (HER3) monoclonal antibody, in patients with metastatic or advanced solid tumors. The study established a recommended Phase 2 dose of AV-203, demonstrated good tolerability and reached the maximum planned dose of AV-203 monotherapy. AVEO is actively pursuing partnerships to further advance the development of AV-203. At the end of the third quarter, AVEO announced that, as part of its plan to decrease operational expenses, the Company entered into a termination agreement with respect to the lease for its headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the Company’s existing lease obligations by $110 million in exchange for a termination fee of approximately $7.8 million due upon execution of the agreement, and $7.8 million payable over the subsequent nine months. The reduction in R&D expense was primarily due to a decrease in manufacturing costs related to the completion of ficlatuzumab manufacturing in Q3 2013, a decrease in tivozanib clinical trial costs associated with the wind down of the development program, and a reduction in personnel-related expenses following AVEO’s June 2013 strategic restructuring. These forward-looking statements include, among others, statements about AVEO’s advancement of its business strategy, including its plans to leverage partner resources to advance AV-380, tivozanib and AV-203; AVEO’s plans to initiate clinical trials of AV-380 in the second half of 2015; AVEO’s plans to initiate a Phase 2 study of ficlatuzumab in 2014; and AVEO’s estimates for its 2014 year-end cash balance and its ability to fund its operating plan into the fourth quarter of 2015. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements that AVEO makes due to a number of important factors, including risks relating to: AVEO’s ability to execute on its business strategy and enter into and maintain new strategic partnerships and collaboration agreements; AVEO’s ability to successfully enroll and complete clinical trials and preclinical studies of its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, or equivalent foreign regulatory agencies, the safety, efficacy and clinically meaningful benefit of its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to achieve and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements applicable to its product candidates; AVEO’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate protection for intellectual property rights relating to its product candidates and technologies; developments and expenses related to AVEO’s ongoing shareholder litigation and SEC inquiry; AVEO’s ability to raise the substantial additional funds required to achieve its goals; unplanned capital requirements; adverse general economic and industry conditions; competitive factors; and those risks discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” included in AVEO’s most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in its other filings with the SEC. AVEO anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its views to change.

The BATON-CRC study enrolled a total of 265 patients randomized 2 to 1 to receive tivozanib in combination with mFOLFOX6 (n=177) compared to bevacizumab and mFOLFOX6 (n=88) as first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic CRC. Patients with high serum NRP-1 had PFS of 7.3 months and 7.5 months for the tivozanib and bevacizumab arms, respectively. An earlier, pre-specified interim futility analysis determined that tivozanib was unlikely to demonstrate superiority to bevacizumab in the primary endpoint of PFS in the intent to treat population (ESMO 2014), resulting in discontinuation of the study. The results presented today are the final results, and include five additional months of study conduct and patient follow-up beyond the data cutoff for the interim futility analysis. In the intent to treat population, the tivozanib and bevacizumab combinations demonstrated comparable results for PFS, the primary endpoint (9.8 months and 9.5 months for tivozanib and bevacizumab, respectively, HR=0.908, p=0.598), and overall response rate (46.9% and 43.2%, for tivozanib and bevacizumab, respectively), while demonstrating comparable safety. A copy of the poster presentation is available on AVEO’s website at www.aveooncology.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on the AVEO website for two weeks following the call.

While beat juggling is not as popular as scratching due to the more demanding rhythmical knowledge it requires, it has proved popular within DJ battles and in certain compositional situations (van Veen & Attias, 2012). ; Electronic drums usually have useful features for both the aspiring beginner or professional alike, such as metronomes with different metronome \"voices\"; play-along songs/loops and samples, with the ability to record practising or playing; syncing of the metronome to a studio DAW metronome instead of using the studio's click; or experimenting with composition. It is also easy to use an MP3 player or iPod to play songs for practice or for looping those parts to target technique issues or replicate drum parts. ; Electronic drums can be played at a significantly lower volume level, and \n\n  Electronic drums is a modern electronic musical instrument, primarily designed to serve as an alternative to an acoustic drum kit. Like regular drums, the pads are struck by drum sticks and they are played in a similar manner to an acoustic drum kit, albeit some differences in the drumming experience. The electronic drum (pad/triggering device) is usually sold as part of \n\n to other DJs. Alongside the evolution of scratching, other practices such as drumming (or scratch drumming) and beat juggling were also evolved significantly during the 1990s. Beat juggling was invented by Steve Dee, a member of the X-Men (later renamed X-Ecutioners) crew. A simple example would be to use two copies of the same drum pattern to evolve the pattern by doubling the snares, syncopating the drum kick, adding rhythm and variation to the existing pattern.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 1999 the Supreme Court ruled on the case Olmstead v. L.C. The Court ruled that it was a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to keep an individual in a more restrictive inpatient setting, such as a hospital, when a more appropriate and less restrictive community service was available to the individual. Effective July 1, 1972, California's Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (LPS Act) set the precedent for modern mental health commitment procedures in the U.S. named after its authors, State Assemblyman Frank Lanterman and State Senators Nicholas C. Petris and Alan Short, the LPS Act sought to \"end the inappropriate, indefinite, and involuntary commitment of persons with mental health disorder\"; to \"provide prompt evaluation and treatment of persons with mental health disorders or impaired by chronic alcoholism\"; and to \"guarantee and protect public safety.\" Despite citing to these articles of intent, the LPS Act violates its own legislative intent through its inclusion of \"gravely disabled\" in its enforcement of involuntary psychiatric hold designations (also known as \"5150 designations\"). First, police officers are not required to make a medical diagnosis of a mental health disorder at the time of a 5150 designation; the broad scope of \"gravely disabled\" increases the number of persons police officers can involuntarily transport, increasing the likelihood of inappropriate and involuntary commitment of persons with mental health disorders. Third, it is unclear whether the LPS Act sought to provide protection for the mentally ill or to provide protection from the mentally ill in its guarantee of protecting \"public safety\"; the inclusion of \"gravely disabled\" in 5150 designations indicates that the LPS Act provided the public with a duplicitous means of removing the mentally ill, impoverished, and houseless from the streets under the guise of \"public safety.\" This Paper suggests the following to help remedy the effects of implementing the broadly defined \"gravely disabled\" in 5150 designations: (1) Remove \"gravely disabled\" from the 5150 criteria; (2) integrate the community with mental health advocacy efforts by creating outreach and education programs; and (3) implement a client-centric approach to interacting with persons with mental health disorders through restorative policing and the establishment of a restorative court.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

A single study investigated babies born to a group of women who took biologics in early pregnancy. This study showed that women taking biologics were not at increased risk of having a baby with a birth defect. Although the study suggested that use of biologics in pregnancy may be linked to having a baby with multiple birth defects, there were problems with the way in which the information was collected and analysed and it is unlikely that there is any true link but this needs to be confirmed by further research. Studying miscarriage rates in women taking rituximab and other monoclonal antibodies is complex as some of the mother’s illnesses that these medicines are used to treat are known to increase the chance of miscarriage. It will therefore be difficult to say whether rituximab has an effect on these outcomes, and future studies will need to address the effects of illness in the mother to answer this question. Infections after birth and risk to newborn babies with live vaccines Rituximab works by destroying a type of blood cell called a B-lymphocyte. There are therefore theoretical concerns that babies who are exposed to rituximab in the womb may be more likely to develop infections after birth, although no studies have addressed this so far. They do not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but are often not advised in people with low immunity. As a precaution, a doctor may recommend that immunisation of the baby with live vaccines is delayed for a few weeks or months after the mother’s final pregnancy dose of rituximab. agalactiae (group B Streptococcus), a major cause of neonatal sepsis. ; A maternal serum metabolite ratio predicts FGR at term and approximately doubles the discrimination capacity between cases and controls as compared to the sFLT1:PlGF ratio. ; The presence of inherited, chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA in the feto-placental unit is associated with an 2-3 fold increased risk of the mother to develop pre-eclampsia; moreover, this study did not identify any other viral associations with pre-eclampsia and FGR.

These include conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, and leflunomide. Additionally, targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs) that inhibit phosphodiesterase-4 or Janus kinases have shown promise in treating psoriatic arthritis [1][2][3][4][5]. Comparative research between different drugs plays a crucial role in clinical decision-making for psoriatic arthritis treatment. While short-term randomized controlled trials using placebo as a comparator have been conducted to gain approval for these newer drugs, there is still limited comparative research available [6]. Clinicians rely on this type of research to understand how different medications compare in terms of effectiveness and safety. However, due to the limited availability of comparative research in this field, clinicians often require guidance when making treatment decisions for psoriatic arthritis patients. Ongoing research efforts aim to address this gap by conducting more comparative studies among different drugs used in the management of psoriatic arthritis. However, more comparative research is needed to guide clinicians in making informed treatment decisions for patients with psoriatic arthritis. A phase III, randomized, controlled trial of apremilast in patients with psoriatic arthritis: results of the PALACE 2 trial. Efficacy and safety of the anti-IL-12/23 p40 monoclonal antibody, ustekinumab in patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite conventional non-biological and biological anti-tumour necrosis factor therapy: 6-month and 1-year results of the phase 3 PSUMMIT 2 study. Ixekizumab, an interleukin-17A specific monoclonal antibody for the treatment of biologic-naive patients with active psoriatic arthritis: Results from the 24-week randomised double-blind placebo-controlled period of the SPIRIT-P1 phase III trial. Tofacitinib or adalimumab versus placebo for psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety of filgotinib, a selective Janus kinase 1 inhibitor, in patients with active psoriatic arthritis (EQUATOR): results from a randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial. It has demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of psoriasis in phase III studies. It is being studied for treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and other immunological diseases, as well as for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Following its validation and wide application in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), synovial tissue analysis has recently been applied to studies on Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA). Such studies aim to thereby clarify its distinctive features and the nature of specific responses upon administration of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) or biologic agents. Keywords: Biologic therapy, psoriatic arthritis, biomarker, synovial tissue,. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease classified amongst spondyloarthropathies (SpA) and affecting patients with either concomitant cutaneous psoriasis or a personal or family history of the same [1Ritchlin CT, Kavanaugh A, Gladman DD, et al. Treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis Ann Rheum Dis 2009; 68: 1387-94.]. Patients with PsA may develop articular structural damage both in terms of erosions and new bone formation, and may also develop systemic complications including the development of metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk with concomitant reduced life expectancy [3Wong K, Gladman DD, Husted J, Long JA, Farewell VT. Mortality studies in psoriatic arthritis: results from a single outpatient clinic. Mortality in psoriatic arthritis Clin Exp Rheumatol 2008; 26: S62-5.]. Ideally such therapeutics would be targeted to those patients most likely to benefit and least likely to develop toxicity. The synovium in PsA represents a primary target of disease pathogenesis, together with the skin, thus it is an intriguing and plausible site at which to explore important mechanisms of disease. Treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis Ann Rheum Dis 2009; 68: 1387-94.,5Bresnihan B, Baeten D, Firestein GS, et al. Synovial tissue analysis in clinical trials J Rheumatol 2005; 32: 2481-4.]. With respect to the latter, it is conceivable that tissue changes early after an intervention may prove predictive of future efficacy and as such could improve early ‘go/no-go’ decision making in drug development, thereby limiting patient exposure to either placebo or ineffective therapies. The synovial membrane in PsA comprises a thickened lining layer containing fibroblast-like synoviocytes and macrophages, overlying a deep interstitial inflammatory tissue within which are situated macrophages, T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, mast cells and widespread evidence of neovascularisation and to some extent lymphangiogenesis. Novel approaches to the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis: lessons from the evaluation of synovial biomarkers in clinical trials Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol 2008; 22: 311-23.]. Thus, the same techniques (arthroscopic and US-guided biopsy) and methods for immunohistologic assessment (manual count, semi-quantitative scores and digital image analysis) and molecular gene analysis (PCR, microarrays) that have contributed to the current knowledge on the pathobiology of inflammatory arthritides have been readily transferred to PsA [7Gerlag D, Tak PP. In particular, immunopathogenic appearances reveal similarities between SpA subgroups, for example comparing oligo- or polyarticular PsA, in terms of major histologic parameters (including lining layer thickness, vascularity, PMN, CD68+ and CD163+ lining and of sublining macrophages) [10Kruithof E, Baeten D, De Rycke L, et al. Synovial histopathology of psoriatic arthritis, both oligo- and polyarticular, resembles spondyloarthropathy more than it does rheumatoid arthritis Arthritis Res Ther 2005; 7: R569-80.]. Immunomodulatory effects of etanercept on peripheral joint synovitis in the spondylarthropathies Arthritis Rheum 2005; 52: 3898-909.]. Nevertheless subtle but potentially functional differences could be critical in allowing a more precise stratification and tailoring of drug to individual patients [12Danning CL, Illei GG, Hitchon C, Greer MR, Boumpas DT, McInnes IB. Macrophage-derived cytokine and nuclear factor kappaB p65 expression in synovial membrane and skin of patients with psoriatic arthritis Arthritis Rheum 2000; 43: 1244-56., 13Boyle DL, Kavanaugh A. The pathobiology of psoriatic synovium Curr Opin Rheumatol 2008; 20: 404-7.]. Furthermore, studies on the effect of interventions on PsA synovial tissue conducted thus far have been limited to small numbers of patients, incomplete evaluation of early and late follow-up time points and the lack of a specific measure of disease activity in PsA. Performance of response criteria for assessing peripheral arthritis in patients with psoriatic arthritis: analysis of data from randomised controlled trials of two tumour necrosis factor inhibitors Ann Rheum Dis 2006; 65: 1373-8.]. Treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis Ann Rheum Dis 2009; 68: 1387-94.]. Most evidence comes from patients treated with MTX. Its effect was evaluated on the synovial leukocyte infiltrate and mRNA and protein levels of several T cell- and macrophage-derived cytokines in a study of a small group of PsA patients [15Kane D, Gogarty M, O'leary J, et al. Reduction of synovial sublining layer inflammation and proinflammatory cytokine expression in psoriatic arthritis treated with methotrexate Arthritis Rheum 2004; 50: 3286-95.]. All patients showed a clinically significant improvement by means of Ritchie articular index (RAI), swollen joint count and disease activity score (DAS). This analysis revealed that an effective response, again determined by a significant improvement in RAI, swollen joint count and DAS, was mirrored by a substantial decrease in the polyclonal component of the synovial T cell infiltrate, representing in turn a major component of the inflammatory infiltrate. Psoriatic arthritis joint fluids are characterized by CD8 and CD4 T cell clonal expansions appear antigen driven J Immunol 2001; 166: 2878-86.]. Indeed, despite the small number of patients included and the pragmatic definition of efficacy (no formal ACR or EULAR response core sets are given in both studies and MTX effect is evaluated at different follow-up time points), these results provide compelling evidence that MTX directly modulates the inflammatory infiltrate in PsA. To assess the potential beneficial effect of a lymphocyte-depleting drug, a study of the synovial infiltrate in PsA patients treated with the fludarabine was performed [19Takada K, Danning CL, Kuroiwa T, et al. Lymphocyte depletion with fludarabine in patients with psoriatic arthritis: clinical and immunological effects Ann Rheum Dis 2003; 62: 1112-5.]. Accordingly, results from cross-sectional studies show that when a conventional treatment (e.g. with MTX) fails to achieve an adequate response in PsA patients that show active disease despite treatment, features of synovitis are not significantly different when compared to patients who do not receive any therapy [10Kruithof E, Baeten D, De Rycke L, et al. Synovial histopathology of psoriatic arthritis, both oligo- and polyarticular, resembles spondyloarthropathy more than it does rheumatoid arthritis Arthritis Res Ther 2005; 7: R569-80. ], and the lack of response is reflected by persistence of inflammation [21van Kuijk AW, Reinders-Blankert P, Smeets TJ, Dijkmans BA, Tak PP. Detailed analysis of the cell infiltrate and the expression of mediators of synovial inflammation and joint destruction in the synovium of patients with psoriatic arthritis: implications for treatment Ann Rheum Dis 2006; 65: 1551-7.]. The advent of biological therapies has had a significant impact on the treatment strategies whereby PsA is managed. TNF-alpha inhibitors have proven efficacious in PsA in reducing signs and symptoms of synovitis, improving patient-reported outcomes (Health Assessment Questionnaire, physical function, Quality of Life, and fatigue) and suppressing radiographic progression [1Ritchlin CT, Kavanaugh A, Gladman DD, et al. Treatment recommendations for psoriatic arthritis Ann Rheum Dis 2009; 68: 1387-94.]. Synovial tissue analysis in clinical trials J Rheumatol 2005; 32: 2481-4.]. Immunomodulatory effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy on synovium in spondylarthropathy: histologic findings in eight patients from an open-label pilot study Arthritis Rheum 2001; 44: 186-95.-24Cañete JD, Pablos JL, Sanmartí R, et al. Antiangiogenic effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy with infliximab in psoriatic arthritis Arthritis Rheum 2004; 50: 1636-41.].

Deactivation of endothelium and reduction in angiogenesis in psoriatic skin and synovium by low dose infliximab therapy in combination with stable methotrexate therapy: a prospective single-centre study Arthritis Res Ther 2004; 6: R326-34.]. Indeed, although the effect on the endothelium was not evaluated at the same very early time-point, after 4 weeks of therapy with low-dose infliximab, a significant reduction in the expression of ICAM-1 on synovial capillaries could be observed, with VCAM and E-selectin showing the same trend [23Goedkoop AY, Kraan MC, Picavet DI, et al. Deactivation of endothelium and reduction in angiogenesis in psoriatic skin and synovium by low dose infliximab therapy in combination with stable methotrexate therapy: a prospective single-centre study Arthritis Res Ther 2004; 6: R326-34.].

Antiangiogenic effects of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy with infliximab in psoriatic arthritis Arthritis Rheum 2004; 50: 1636-41.]. Recently, a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial with adalimumab has confirmed and reinforced previous results in open-label and smaller trials by comparing synovial tissue histology before and after a short course of treatment [27van Kuijk AW, Gerlag DM, Vos K, et al. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study to identify biomarkers associated with active treatment in psoriatic arthritis: effects of adalimumab treatment on synovial tissue Ann Rheum Dis 2009; 68: 1303-9.]. By covariance analysis of all the tested variables, and thus taking into account the inter-patient variability and baseline differences already present despite randomization, the decrease in CD3+ T cell infiltration and in MMP-13 expression still significantly reflected changes induced by the TNF-alpha inhibitor. Although the small numbers recruited and the preliminary nature of this study preclude definitive conclusion, in light of recent data in RA showing a reversal of LN in patients who achieved a good EULAR response after a short course of anti-TNF-alpha therapy [29Cañete JD, Celis R, Moll C, et al. ], LN features could represent a valuable biomarker of response and deserve further analysis in PsA. ], in a study designed to assess safety and tolerability of the drug (not powered to detect a significant clinical effect of the drug on articular disease) the synovial tissue showed a significant reduction in CD3+ T lymphocytes and CD68+ lining and sublining macrophages, together with a decreased proportion of P-selectin+ vessels and a down-regulation of vascular αvβ3-integrin [30McInnes IB, Illei GG, Danning CL, et al. Alefacept treatment in psoriatic arthritis: reduction of the effector T cell population in peripheral blood and synovial tissue is associated with improvement of clinical signs of arthritis Arthritis Rheum 2002; 46: 2776-84.]. More recently, the synovial tissue response to abatacept, a CTLA4-Ig fusion protein, has been also described in a case report of a patient with severe refractory PsA [32Cañete JD, Celis R, Hernandez V, Pablos JL, Sanmartí R. Synovial immunopathological changes associated with successful abatacept therapy in a case of severe refractory pasoriatic arthritis Ann Rheum Dis 2010; 69: 935-6.]. Interference with co-stimulatory pathways was efficacious in terms of clinical parameters of the patient joint and skin disease and in inducing reduction of synovial infiltration of CD15+ lining neutrophils, CD68+ sublining macrophages and CD3+ T lymphocytes. Cutaneous psoriatic lesions are characterized by keratinocyte proliferation, an inflammatory infiltrate driven by a cytokine and chemokine network and endothelial activation with enhanced adhesion molecule and integrin expression [33Nickoloff BJ, Nestle FO. Clonal characteristics of T cell infiltrates in skin and synovium of patients with psoriatic arthritis Hum Immunol 1999; 60: 479-91.]. Deactivation of endothelium and reduction in angiogenesis in psoriatic skin and synovium by low dose infliximab therapy in combination with stable methotrexate therapy: a prospective single-centre study Arthritis Res Ther 2004; 6: R326-34.]. Nonetheless, studies directly comparing effects of drugs on both tissues have occasionally revealed discrepancy between skin and synovium responses, especially when the efficacy of the drug was limited overall or the dosage of the drug was suboptimal for one compartment [19Takada K, Danning CL, Kuroiwa T, et al. Lymphocyte depletion with fludarabine in patients with psoriatic arthritis: clinical and immunological effects Ann Rheum Dis 2003; 62: 1112-5., 23Goedkoop AY, Kraan MC, Picavet DI, et al. Deactivation of endothelium and reduction in angiogenesis in psoriatic skin and synovium by low dose infliximab therapy in combination with stable methotrexate therapy: a prospective single-centre study Arthritis Res Ther 2004; 6: R326-34., 30McInnes IB, Illei GG, Danning CL, et al. Beside pharmacokinetic explanations, biologic mechanisms for discrepant responses have been proposed. For example apoptosis of dermal CD11c+ DCs can be induced by TNF-alpha blockade in psoriatic skin responsive to treatment [35Malaviya R, Sun Y, Tan JK, et al. The same effect has not been documented in the synovium, where apoptosis is not thought to be a major contributor to the reduction of the inflammatory infiltrate [25Smeets TJ, Kraan MC, van Loon ME, Tak PP.

Patients enrolled in the study had an inadequate response to methotrexate or/and to one or more anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) therapies. While the drug may work well in about 40% of the patients, it is either not tolerated or ineffective in the remainder of the patients.The trial showed a modest effect of leflunomide on the inflammatory process, but unfortunately the drug was not tested for its effect on prevention of damage.They tried leflunomide, a medication similar to methotrexate, as part of the TOPAS trial.However, despite the fact that the inflammation appears to be better controlled with higher doses of methotrexate, we still do not have any evidence that methotrexate actually prevents progression of joint damage. Azathioprine was found to work for both skin and joints in some patients, but it too did not prevent progression of joint damage. In the past 20 years there have been several randomized controlled trials of sulfasalazine in patients with psoriatic arthritis. It provides marginal benefit over placebo with regards to joint inflammation. The study based on the University of Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Clinic database demonstrated that a large proportion of the patients could not take the drug because of side effects and, in those who continued to take it, there was no protection from progression of joint damage. Patients attending the University of Toronto Psoriatic Arthritis Clinic have participated in a number of randomized controlled trials. While the drug may work well in about 40% of the patients, it is either not tolerated or ineffective in the remainder of the patients.Among them, the anti-TNF agents have been the most successful.Three drugs, etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab, have shown a remarkable improvement in signs and symptoms of skin and joint manifestations.These drugs also work to improve quality of life and function, and, importantly, they prevent the progression of joint damage.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. In collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples. The Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December. Médecins Sans Frontières reported at least 200 presumed cases per day. Additional presumed cases occurred in Buzi, Tica, and Nhamathanda; however, the more rural nature of these areas lessened the risk of a widespread outbreak. At least four people contracted typhoid in Dombé, Manica Province, with reports of other illnesses appearing in the province. The Government of China sprayed anti-cholera disinfectant across Beria and sent doctors. The 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak is the first modern large-scale outbreak of cholera—a disease once considered beaten back largely due to the invention of modern sanitation. The disease was reintroduced to Haiti in October 2010, not long after the disastrous earthquake earlier that year, and since then cholera has spread across the country and become endemic, causing high levels of both morbidity and mortality. Early efforts were made to cover up the source of the epidemic, but thanks largely to the investigations of journalist Jonathan M. Katz and epidemiologist Renaud Piarroux, today it is widely believed to be the result of contamination by infected United Nations peacekeepers deployed from Nepal. In terms of total infections, the outbreak has since been surpassed by the war-fueled 2016–2021 Yemen cholera outbreak, although the Haiti outbreak is still one of the most deadly modern outbreaks. Cases of cholera (specifically from Vibrio cholerae ), a disease transmitted via water contaminated with feces and endemic to Mozambique, were reported in Beira on 22 March.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Seminal oxidative stress refers to an assessment of the degree of oxidative damage to sperm cells. It is important to evaluate oxidative stress because excessive levels can impair sperm function and lead to infertility. This test helps identify any underlying issues with sperm function and viability. Considering these additional factors provides a more comprehensive understanding of male factor infertility and helps guide the selection of appropriate treatment methods. If necessary, the fertility specialist may recommend consulting a urologist to ensure optimal treatment and to facilitate effective communication between medical specialists. In summary, the goal of molecular diagnostics in sperm analysis is to identify the specific reasons for male infertility, which allows for the selection of tailored treatment methods and helps couples achieve their dream of having a child. Advances in ART, however, have created new possibilities for men with male factor infertility, including those whose sperm counts have been decreased by cancer treatment and other diseases, and men with incurable, sexually transmissible virus diseases. Washed sperm is used in artificial insemination using the intrauterine insemination (IUI) technique and in in vitro fertilization (IVF). Sperm washing is a standard procedure in infertility treatment. Once the fastest sperm have been isolated, before using them for artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization, it is important to confirm the absence of HIV virus in the sample. Treatment for oligospermia is centered around underlying causes, such as endocrine and systematic disorders that can cause hypogonadism. Although there is no FDA indication for use of aromatase inhibitors improving spermatogenesis, testolactone has been shown to be effective when compared to placebo. Though there is no FDA indication for the use of clomiphene in male infertility, it has been prescribed since the 1960s. Combinations of vitamins and minerals, including selenium, co-enzyme Q10, L-carnitine, folic acid, zinc, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have been shown to improve male infertility, but due to \n\nInflammation of the cervix (cervicitis)—often due to ureaplasma, chlamydia, gonorrhea, or other organisms\n\n4.Male infertility because the male partner has a low sperm count\n\n3.2.The best method of ensuring that the timing is correct is by performing daily home ovulation urine testing, which will show a color change eight to 36 hours prior to the occurrence of ovulation.At the appropriate time the physician inserts a speculum in the woman's vagina, retrieves some cervical mucus, and evaluates the physical-chemical properties that normally occur in the mucus at ovulation. _**Postcoital test (PCT), or Huhner test**_. At the same time the physician may conduct a postcoital test (PCT), or Huhner test, to assess the interaction of the mucus and sperm. The PCT is a good screening test because it provides a rough evaluation of the quality of the sperm as well as of the cervical mucus. At the same time, a less favorable postcoital test does not necessarily indicate a cervical-mucus deficiency because the sperm could be at fault. If the test is performed more than 12 hours after ovulation has occurred, the cervical mucus may have become thick and tenacious, thereby preventing the invasion of sperm. Accordingly, the postcoital test should be performed immediately prior to or at the time of ovulation.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a devastating, degenerative neurological condition that strikes athletes who play contact sports, veterans who’ve seen combat, and domestic violence survivors, among others. CTE can affect anyone whose brain sustains too much trauma, even multiple “mild” concussions—but thus far, there’s no way to diagnose the disease until after death, when it’s too late to treat. New research into a biomarker specific to the disease is providing fresh hope, however. Researchers from Boston University (BU) and the VA Boston Healthcare System (VABHS) have identified a biomarker — a protein called CCL11 — that points to the specific presence of CTE. If the research pans out, doctors will be able to detect the problem in living patients, treat them, and monitor their progress. The protein eotaxin-1 or CCL11 may be the early indicator researchers have been looking for. The link arose from a study of the protein’s presence in spinal fluid and blood of those diagnosed with CTE post-mortem. They also found that this was not true of Alzheimer’s patients or control athletes. “What’s most likely going to happen is that we’ll end up with a panel of biomarkers — maybe three or four — that will let us diagnose CTE reliably,” BU researcher Jonathan Cherry told BU Today. The damage to the brain is caused by clumps defective tau proteins, which kill neurons; it’s a similar process to the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. However, in the case of CTE, the damage itself may be done early in life, while symptoms might not be noticeable for years, or even decades. Early intervention and targeted treatments can help slow the disease’s progression and mitigate against the symptoms, but since formal diagnosis of CTE can currently only be made post-mortem, this kind of intervention is rare. There is no way to know exactly how prevalent CTE is among the general population, or even among those populations most likely to have it, given the difficulty in diagnosing it. The ability to identify the presence of the disease early will be a tremendous step in helping those who suffer from it. Diagnosing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be challenging due to the lack of established reliable biomarkers and poor recognition of its clinical presentations. However, in living individuals suspected of having CTE, diagnosis is often based on clinical suspicion using proposed research criteria of clinical presentations. While they cannot provide a definitive diagnosis, they can help in the assessment and identification of certain brain changes that are consistent with CTE. Early recognition and intervention are crucial for improving patient care and outcomes in suspected cases of CTE. Medical biomarkers fall into 5 major categories: 1) diagnostic (used to identify if you have a disease or condition); 2) prognostic (used to determine how well you will do with the disease or condition); 3) predictive (used to determine if you may get the disease); 4) efficacy or monitoring (used to determine how well a drug or treatment is doing in fighting the disease) and 5) exposure (used to \n\nIn this video, Marc Goldfinger provides us with an overview of his work on CTE and boxer’s brains, including why CTE is of increasing public interest. A potential breakthrough in diagnosing Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) involves the identification of a specific biomarker called CCL11. This protein has been found to be present in higher levels in the spinal fluid and blood of individuals diagnosed with CTE post-mortem. By measuring the levels of CCL11 in living patients, doctors may be able to diagnose CTE accurately and monitor its progression. This biomarker could serve as an early indicator, allowing for early intervention and treatment strategies. Additionally, this breakthrough may lead to the development of a panel of biomarkers, comprising three or four proteins, that can aid in the diagnosis of CTE. However, the discovery of a potential biomarker for diagnosing CTE during life is a significant development in the field and offers promising possibilities for early detection and treatment of this devastating condition.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

The anti inflammatory properties of sulforaphane, one of the isothiocyanates (ITCs) in broccoli, may be able to prevent (or even reverse) some of the damage to blood vessel linings that can be caused by inflammation due to chronic blood sugar problems. Broccoli is a good carb and is high in fiber, which aids in digestion, prevents constipation, maintains low blood sugar, and curbs overeating. Broccolis isothiocyanates and omega 3 fatty acids also help to regulate inflammation. Furthermore, a 2010 study published in the journal Inflammation Researcher suggested that the flavonoid kaempferol lessens the impact of allergens, especially in the intestinal tract, which can reduce chronic inflammation. A study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America found that the sprouts of broccoli may be especially potent in this regard. Broccoli is a great anti inflammatory and may slow down the damage to joints associated with osteoarthritis. A 2013 study at the University of East Anglia found that broccolis sulforaphane may help people suffering from arthritis because this chemical blocks the enzymes that cause joint destruction by stopping a key molecule known to cause inflammation. Broccoli may help prevent skin cancer, not by eating it though, but by applying it directly to the skin. At broccoli just three times each month and you could potentially reduce the chance of developing bladder cancer6 by around 40 percent, according to experts at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, USA. eating a diet of raw fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, berries, and grains; ; consuming foods containing omega-3 fatty acids such as fish, fish-derived supplements, as well as flax seed oil, borage oil, and other non-animal-based oils; ; abdominal fat reduction; ; aerobic exercise; ; inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis (known as statins); ; low normal blood glucose levels (glycated hemoglobin, also called HbA1c); ; micronutrient (vitamins, potassium, and magnesium) consumption; ; maintaining normal, or healthy, blood pressure levels; ; aspirin supplement ; oligosaccharide 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin can solubilize cholesterol, removing it from plaques Many approaches have been promoted as methods to reduce or reverse atheroma progression:\n\nFor example, red foods are lycopene-rich \"superfoods. \"By and large it is true.You may have heard that it's the deepest-colored fruits and vegetables that carry the most nutritional benefit.One fruit has it all; this brilliant red fruit can help prevent and reverse heart disease, help prevent dementia, and inhibit the cartilage breakdown associated with osteoarthritis.Most of the studies on the pomegranate have focused on its effect on heart disease. Clinical studies in humans have focused on the pomegranate's ability to prevent and treat atherosclerosis, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and cancer. Some studies on the health benefits of pomegranates have explored their ability to stop and even reverse the buildup of plaque in arteries. It has been suggested that pomegranates combat atherosclerosis by stimulating paraoxonase (PON) enzyme activity and HDL-associated protein. Animal studies show that polyphenols inhibit LDL oxidation and reduce atherosclerosis, thus reducing the risk for cardiovascular problems such as heart attack and stroke. In addition to its cardiovascular protection, pomegranates offer help for osteoarthritis by inhibiting cartilage breakdown. One fruit has it all; this brilliant red fruit can help prevent and reverse heart disease, help prevent dementia, and inhibit the cartilage breakdown associated with osteoarthritis. \"High consumption of lycopene foods will reduce the risk of heart attacks.Carotenoids are usually orange foods, but may also include dark green vegetables.They include carrots, watermelon, tomatoes, cantaloupe, pink grapefruit, sweet potatoes, squash, and spinach.Carotenoids may lower the risk of developing cancer and are very important in immune function.And yes, you need to eat your broccoli. Carotenoids may also aid in lowering cholesterol levels by interfering in the pathway within the body that they share, causing a cholesterol traffic jam or by inhibiting cholesterol-forming enzymes. Furthermore, carotenoids are believed to prevent the oxidation of fats in blood vessels, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis, heart disease, stroke, and blood clots.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

It was the first piece of federal legislation to address HIV criminalization and provided incentives for states to reconsider laws and practices that target people with HIV for consensual sexual activity and conduct that poses no risk of HIV transmission. Barbara Lee re-introduced the REPEAL HIV Discrimination Act 2013 as H.R. They recommended that this law be applicable only when HIV is actually transmitted and \"HIV non-disclosure should never be prosecuted if (1) the infected individual has an undetectable viral load (less than 200 copies per millilitre of blood); (2) condoms are used; (3) the infected individual’s partner is on PrEP or (4) \n\n In many English-speaking countries and in most of the states who have signed the European Convention of Human Rights, knowingly infecting others with HIV can lead to criminal prosecution. One such case is that of Thomas Guerra, an American landscape architect, who became the first person in the state of California to be convicted for intentionally infecting another individual with HIV. In a 2004 survey of the latter group, the Global Network of People Living with HIV/AIDS found that at least one prosecution had occurred in about half of these countries, and that in Finland, Sweden and Slovakia, about 0.5% to 1% of all people reported to be living with HIV/AIDS had been prosecuted for alleged intentional or \"negligent\" transmission of HIV. In many developing countries such as Thailand where the HIV/AIDS pandemic has been much more serious, laws regarding criminalisation of intentional transmission have been either weak or non-existent. The Consenting Adult Sex Bill (Assembly Bill 489) is a consenting adult law, passed in California in 1975 and effective in January 1976, that repealed the sodomy law in California so that it applied only in criminal situations and made gay sex legal for the first time. campaign to combat HIV-related stigma and discrimination against people with HIV by the U.S. criminal justice system.

One important factor is the relatively short duration of use of nicotine patches compared to other replacement drugs used for maintenance purposes. However, it is crucial to understand that the effectiveness of nicotine-replacement treatments is heavily influenced by external factors. Factors such as lack of readiness to change, limited social supports, and contact with other smokers can outweigh the impact of the replacement drug. External cues from friends, media, music, and even the neighborhood can exert a considerable influence that may undermine the effectiveness of nicotine-replacement treatments. Similarly, nicotine-replacement treatments should be seen as part of a larger approach to tobacco addiction, addressing both the physiological and psychological aspects of the addiction. Overall, the limited effectiveness of nicotine-replacement treatments for tobacco addiction can be attributed to the powerful influence of external factors and the complex nature of addiction. A comprehensive treatment plan that includes addressing environmental triggers and providing adequate social support is crucial for achieving long-term success in quitting tobacco. A meta-analysis found that fewer than 20% of people treated with nicotine replacement therapy remain abstinent from smoking at one year. Conventional treatment methods for cigarette addiction that focus on separating nicotine addiction from the other habit-forming features of cigarettes include the use of nicotine replacement therapies such as nicotine patches and nicotine inhalers. It is important to note that there are no proven natural aids for treating cigarette addiction. It is worth considering as an adjunct therapy, but its long-term efficacy is still uncertain. In summary, conventional treatment methods for cigarette addiction that aim to separate nicotine addiction from other habit-forming features include nicotine replacement therapies, medications like varenicline and bupropion, and acupuncture as an adjunct therapy. Reversal of the short term cardiovascular adverse effects of smoking is rapid. The pharmacology of nicotine has not been studied in older patients but is unlikely to change in clinically important ways with advancing age. Transdermal nicotine is the replacement therapy of choice in older patients because of once-daily administration and good tolerability. Approximately half of the users of transdermal nicotine smoke concurrently with treatment. It is unlikely that concurrent smoking or high doses of nicotine replacement therapy will adversely effect healthy patients. While it is generally believed that patients with unstable coronary heart disease may be at risk from concurrent smoking during nicotine replacement therapy, it is unclear whether this risk is greater than the risk of smoking alone. Nicotine replacement therapy is a logical approach for motivated, older smokers who are unable to stop smoking by simpler means. When using nicotine replacement therapy, there are several precautions that should be taken:\n\n1. Stop smoking: To fully benefit from nicotine replacement therapy and minimize the risk of side effects, it is important to stop smoking cigarettes as soon as you start the treatment. Inform your doctor about existing conditions: If you have liver or kidney disease, hyperthyroidism, insulin-dependent diabetes, pheochromocytoma, peptic ulcer disease, or any endocrine disorder, it is necessary to inform your doctor before starting nicotine replacement therapy. The specific effects of nicotine replacement therapy on pregnancy are unknown. Breast-feeding: Nicotine from the therapy can pass into breast milk, so it is advisable to avoid the therapy or discontinue nursing until you have finished the medicine. Not recommended for infants & children: Nicotine replacement therapy is not recommended for use in infants and children. Prolonged use: Nicotine replacement therapy is typically intended for short-term use and may take several months. Inform healthcare professionals: Make sure to inform any doctor or dentist you consult that you are undergoing nicotine replacement therapy, as it may affect the results of certain medical tests. If you have any concerns or questions about using nicotine replacement therapy, it is recommended that you consult with your healthcare provider.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

National Organization for Marriage board member and fiction writer Orson Scott Card has supported biological research on homosexuality, writing that \"our scientific efforts in regard to homosexuality should be to identify genetic and uterine causes... so that the incidence of this dysfunction can be minimized.... [However, this should not be seen] as an attack on homosexuals, a desire to 'commit genocide' against the homosexual community... Brendan Zietsch of the Queensland Institute of Medical Research proposes the alternative theory that men exhibiting female traits become more attractive to females and are thus more likely to mate, provided the genes involved do not drive them to complete rejection of heterosexuality. In a 2008 study, its authors stated that \"There is considerable evidence that human sexual orientation is genetically influenced, so it is not known how homosexuality, which tends to lower reproductive success, is maintained in \n\nThe challenges faced by the gay community in San Francisco in becoming aware of the threat of immune-deficiency diseases were influenced by several factors. This cautious approach was partly aimed at keeping homophobes in check but also reflected a lack of scientific certainty. He believed it to be a sexually transmitted disease, making the epidemiology less complex compared to other factors. In summary, the challenges faced by the gay community in San Francisco in understanding the threat of immune-deficiency diseases stemmed from a lack of concrete evidence, the cautious approach of health authorities, the need for strong scientific analysis, and the complexity surrounding the epidemiology of the diseases. Multiple genes have been found to play a role in sexual orientation. There is, however, a vast non-social environment that is non-genetic yet still biological, such as prenatal development, that likely helps shape sexual orientation. They hypothesized that \"while genes predisposing to homosexuality reduce homosexuals' reproductive success, they may confer some advantage in heterosexuals who carry them\". Their results suggested that \"genes predisposing to homosexuality may confer a mating advantage in heterosexuals, which could help explain the evolution and maintenance of homosexuality in the population\". However, in the same study, the authors noted that \"nongenetic alternative explanations cannot be ruled out\" as a reason for the heterosexual in the homosexual-heterosexual twin pair having more partners, specifically citing \"social pressure on the other twin to act in a more heterosexual way\" (and thus seek out a greater number\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Eight women each year had an ectopic pregnancy - when the embryo implants outside the uterus - that was diagnosed after the attempted abortion. Of the 233,805 abortions during the study period, 385 women had a serious side effect, including 238 who sought ER treatment, 135 who were admitted to the hospital, 114 who had a blood transfusion and 57 who required intravenous antibiotics. SOURCE: Obstetrics and Gynecology, online December 20, 2012.\n\n per 100,000 live births, while the US abortion mortality rate is 0.7 maternal deaths per 100,000 procedures. In the UK, guidelines of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists state that \"Women should be advised that abortion is generally safer than continuing a pregnancy to term.\" Worldwide, on average, abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. A 2007 study reported that \"26% of all pregnancies worldwide are terminated by induced abortion,\" whereas \"deaths from improperly performed [abortion] procedures constitute 13% of maternal mortality globally.\" In Indonesia in 2000 it was estimated that 2 million pregnancies ended in abortion, 4.5 million pregnancies were carried to term, \n\nA self-induced abortion (also called a self-managed abortion, or sometimes a self-induced miscarriage) is an abortion performed by the pregnant woman herself, or with the help of other, non-medical assistance. Although the term includes abortions induced outside of a clinical setting with legal, sometimes over-the-counter medication, it also refers to efforts to terminate a pregnancy through alternative, potentially more dangerous methods. Self-induced (or self-managed) abortion is often attempted during the beginning of pregnancy (the first eight weeks from the last menstrual period). In recent years, significant reductions in maternal death and injury resulting from self-induced abortions have been attributed to the increasing availability of misoprostol (known commercially as \"Cytotec\"). Methods attempted\nWomen can use many different methods to self-manage (or self-induce) an abortion. In Latin America, women have reported self-inducing abortions with misoprostol alone since the 1980s. The history of women self-managing abortion with pills includes projects such as the Socorristas in Argentina and Las Libres in Mexico. The side effects of medication abortion include uterine cramping and prolonged bleeding, and common side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The majority of women who use abortion pills on their own do not need an ultrasound or a clinician, although one may be recommended to ensure that the pregnancy is not ectopic. Studies confirm a correlation between the increase in the self-administration of medical abortion with misoprostol, and a reduction in maternal morbidity and mortality. Some studies argue that unfettered access to medication abortion is a key tenet of public health, human rights, and reproductive rights. Rates\n, an estimated 56 million abortions occurred worldwide, of which 25 million are less safe or least safe. It is difficult to measure the prevalence or rate of self-induced abortions. , in the United States, the estimate was that one in 10 abortions is self-induced. While maternal morbidity and mortality from unsafe abortion has continued to increase due to population growth, in Latin America, from 2005 to 2012, there was a 31% decrease in the number of complications from unsafe abortion, from 7.7/1,000 to 5.3/1,000. In late 2019, it was reported that rates of self-induced abortion in the United States were rising, partly due to fears that more conservative policies would limit access to clinical abortion, and partly due to the increased availability and convenience of telehealth medical supervision and prescriptions and mail-order drugs. History\nThe practice of attempted self-induced abortion has long been recorded in the United States. In the 1994 documentary Motherless: A Legacy of Loss from Illegal Abortion, Louis Gerstley, M.D., said that, in addition to knitting needles, some women would use the spokes of bicycle wheels or umbrellas. Dr. David Reuben mentions that many African women use a carved wooden \"abortion stick\" to induce, which has often been handed down. A study concluded in 1968 determined that over 500,000 illegal abortions were performed every year in the United States, a portion of which were performed by women acting alone. A 1979 study noted that many women who required hospitalization following self-induced abortion attempts were admitted under the pretext of having had a miscarriage or spontaneous abortion. WHO estimates that approximately 25 million abortions continue to be performed unsafely each year. Around 7 million women are admitted to hospitals every year in developing countries and between 4.7% – 13.2% of all maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion. Almost every one of these deaths and disabilities could have been prevented through sexual education, family planning, and the provision of safe abortion services. The 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade made abortion more readily available throughout the U.S., yet women who have abortions with pills ordered online or through non-clinical means may face risk of arrest. It is not common for women in the United States to be charged for the crime of self-inducing an abortion and they are rarely convicted. These women were prosecuted under a variety of laws including: laws directly criminalizing self-induced abortions, laws criminalizing harm to fetuses, criminal abortion laws misapplied to people who self-induce, and various laws deployed when no other legal authorization could be found. As of 2019, there are seven states with laws directly criminalizing self-induced abortion, 11 states with laws criminalizing harm to fetuses that lack adequate exemptions for the pregnant woman, and 15 states with criminal abortion laws that could be applied to women who self-induce an abortion.

In the US from 2000 to 2009, abortion had a lower mortality rate than plastic surgery, and a similar or lower mortality rate than running a marathon. The risk of abortion-related mortality increases with gestational age, but remains lower than that of childbirth.

While maternal mortality seldom results from safe abortions, unsafe abortions result in 70,000 deaths and 5 million disabilities per year. Secondary infertility caused by an unsafe abortion affects an estimated 24 million women. The rate of unsafe abortions has increased from 44% to 49% between 1995 and 2008. Health education, access to family planning, and improvements in health care during and after abortion have been proposed to address this phenomenon.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

In considering the epidemiological triad (agent-host-environment) applicable to all disease, we investigated a possible environmental factor in the COVID-19 pandemic: ambient radiofrequency radiation from wireless communication systems including microwaves and millimeter waves. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic, surfaced in Wuhan, China shortly after the implementation of city-wide (fifth generation [5G] of wireless communications radiation [WCR]), and rapidly spread globally, initially demonstrating a statistical correlation to international communities with recently established 5G networks. In this study, we examined the peer-reviewed scientific literature on the detrimental bioeffects of WCR and identified several mechanisms by which WCR may have contributed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a toxic environmental cofactor.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Our team has a great deal of experience in treating children with neurological conditions, and whilst an epilepsy surgery service is fairly new, it’s proven to be very successful. We operate on the brain to try to reduce seizures or even cure your child’s epilepsy, and generally we see these results in 50-75% of patients. Epilepsy surgery is an operation on the brain (called a neurosurgical operation) to try to stop or reduce the number of your child’s seizures (also called fits). Surgery is the only thing that might actually cure your child’s epilepsy. There are different types of epilepsy surgery that can be done, and the type of operation will depend on your child’s epilepsy. After talking with your Neurologist and Neurosurgeon your child may need further tests before any surgery can be considered. The neuropsychology test assesses your child’s concentration, short-term memory and learning abilities, and the psychiatry assessment assesses your child’s feelings and mood. Based on the results of these detailed tests, your child’s Neurologist and Neurosurgeon will then talk with you about whether your child is suitable for epilepsy surgery, as well as the type of surgery and all the possible risks and benefits. This depends on the underlying cause of your child’s epilepsy, where the seizures are coming from and the type of surgery they may undergo. Generally, 50% to 75% of those who have epilepsy surgery will have their seizures stopped or greatly reduced. The results are better if your child’s seizures come from the part of the brain called the temporal lobe. What should I expect from epilepsy surgery? Hemispherectomy or hemispherotomy – sometimes used to treat very severe epilepsy in children with damage to the whole of one side of the brain. It is particularly done in children with very severe epilepsy and who have lots of ‘drop fits’ each day. These ‘drop fits’ are called atonic or tonic seizures. Sub-pial resection – thin cuts are made in the motor areas of the brain that do not affect the motor function but do prevent the spread of seizures. This type of EEG only needs to be undertaken in some children before they have an operation to remove a small part of their brain. Rarely, your child may have some weakness affecting one side of their body but this usually improves after a few days. Some children may have a few seizures for the first week after surgery. However, this does not necessarily mean that the surgery has not worked because it is more likely that these seizures will be linked to the actual surgery. What about my child’s anti-epileptic medication? Your child should continue to take their anti-epileptic drugs for at least six months after surgery. Your child’s Neurologist will advise you when would be the best time to start to slowly reduce your child’s anti-epileptic medication. For others, it may mean reducing the number or the severity of seizures. Upon accepting a referral, children are discussed at a multidisciplinary MDT where a decision will be made as to whether they are suitable for surgery or whether further investigations are needed in order for a decision to be made. ; corpus callosotomy, which has shown to be effective with atonic seizures. This procedure is considered in cases in which vagus nerve stimulation has failed ; transcranial direct current stimulation ; resection In the past, LGS patients were not eligible for surgery, as the medical community thought the LGS involved the whole brain as a generalized epilepsy in all cases. Two studies on LGS patients series who underwent curative surgery in Korea and China, showed very good results, up to seizure freedom for 80% of these patients below 5 years old, and 40% above 5 years old. Like all epilepsy curative surgeries, seizures may recur in the years following surgery, but surgery allows the child to have better brain development during the seizure free period. To identify the diagnosis doctor advised to go for complete evolution - usually, blood investigation, Neuropsychological tests, (CT) scans, magnetic resonance (MRI) imaging, Electroencephalogram (EEG), High-density EEG, Functional MRI (fMRI), Positron emission tomography (PET scans). Before surgery, the surgeon and anaesthesia will guide you about the benefits and risk factor of epilepsy surgery. Treatment:- Doctors generally start treating epilepsy with medication. If medications don't work then only neuro doctor advised for surgery or another type of treatment. It is a most common procedure for children who suffer intractable seizures and its control seizures for nearly 80% of these patients. Step 1 – Anesthesia: Epilepsy surgery takes 3 to 4 hours depending upon the procedures by giving local anaesthesia to relieve pain. Looking through an operative microscope and then the surgeon removes that area of the brain where seizures occur. Step 4 –The results: There are some types of seizures can be resistant to medication, but they're also the most likely to be helped by epilepsy surgery. Many patients no longer have seizures after epilepsy surgery. Patients are advised to relax the first few weeks after epilepsy surgery. Some seizures can be resistant to medication, but they're also the most likely to be helped by epilepsy surgery. Many patients no longer have seizures after epilepsy surgery. What are the advantages and disadvantages of epilepsy surgery? What are risk factors for this type of epilepsy surgery? Particular interest in clinical neurophysiology (EEG and video EEG), differential diagnosis of seizures in children, and selection of patients who will benefit from epilepsy surger. Nonseizure movements were detected 204 times, with opportunity for canceling transmission by the patient. Intractable epilepsy following successful brain tumor surgery in children may have several underlying causes such as residual tumor, cortical dysplasia, and gliosis. After the second operation, 3 children were seizure free, 1 only had auras, 2 had rare complex partial seizures, and 3 continued to have relatively frequent seizures, although the frequency and severity were reduced. Despite reassuring brain imaging results, residual tumor was present more often than expected in pathological specimens. Patients with developmental disabilities, including retardation and global developmental delay, are not ideal candidates for epilepsy surgery. Because they have an increased likelihood of diffuse brain dysfunction and multifocal or generalized epileptogenic zones, there is an increased chance that a focal cortical resection will not confer a major improvement in their seizure frequency and severity. There is also increased concern that cortical resection will lead to increase in the patient's disability. However, by applying the basic principles of epilepsy surgery selection (i.e., convergence of multiple lines of localizing evidence) to this population, patients with a reasonable likelihood of good seizure control can be identified. It has previously been reported that benign partial epilepsy in infancy constitutes up to 29% of the epilepsies presenting in the first 2 years of life. Of 331 patients, 22 (6.6%) fulfilled the criteria with a minimum of 2 years and a mean of 4 years of follow-up off antiepilepsy drug treatment. Neuroimaging studies were normal in all patients. Nineteen were treated with antiepilepsy drugs. At last follow-up (mean duration of 52.2 months), all patients were seizure free and off antiepilepsy drugs. Benign partial epilepsy in infancy is an epilepsy syndrome of short duration and is easily recognized using accepted classification criteria. Benign partial epilepsy in infancy appears to be an idiopathic localization-related epilepsy with a favorable prognosis. Based on our findings, we suggest weaning of antiepilepsy drugs 6 months after seizure onset. A 6-year-old boy presented with epilepsia partialis continua 6 months after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibodies were found in his serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Anti-epileptic agents did not improve his seizures. High-dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin resulted in decreased anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 antibody levels and resolution of his seizures. Ninety-one percent of the EEGs performed with sedation were completed successfully. The proportion of children who required sedation decreased from 32% to just 2% during that time period.Sedation of children who are undergoing EEG examinations is effective and safe. Most AEEGs were performed to discriminate between epileptic and nonepileptic seizures. Ten were recorded to determine whether they were having frequent subtle seizures or frequent interictal epileptiform discharges. The remaining 157 patients had discrete events. There are three main components to the evaluation of children who are candidates for epilepsy surgery: (1) confirmation of the epileptic nature of the seizures, (2) establishing the medical intractability of the child's epilepsy and (3) localization of the epileptogenic zone. Differentiating epileptic from nonepileptic events requires careful review of the history and the electroencephalogram. Medical intractability is established by assuring that antiepileptic medications appropriate for the child's particular epilepsy syndrome have been used and have been titrated to maximum tolerance before being deemed ineffective. Although such treatment can be costly, multiple studies have demonstrated that ATL in patients who have failed at least two anticonvulsant drug trials (thereby meeting the criteria for medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy) has lower mortality, lower morbidity and lower long-term cost in comparison with continued medical therapy without surgical intervention. The strongest evidence supporting ATL over continued medical therapy for medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy is a prospective, randomized trial of ATL compared to best medical therapy (anticonvulsants), which convincingly demonstrated that the seizure-free rate after surgery was ~ 60% as compared to only 8% for the medicine only group. Furthermore, there was no mortality in the surgery group, while there was seizure-related mortality in the medical therapy group. Therefore, ATL is considered the standard of care for patients with medically intractable mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Diabetes is listed as an adverse reaction on the MMR II vaccine used in the USA. Neither of the two MMR vaccines used in the UK list diabetes in their information and evidence shows there is no link between the MMR vaccine and Type 1 diabetes. A post claiming that type 1 diabetes is listed as a side effect of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella virus) vaccine has been shared on Facebook over 2,000 times. But, perhaps confusingly, that doesn’t mean it’s a side effect caused by the vaccine. What’s more, the evidence shows there is no link between MMR vaccines and diabetes. The Vaccine Knowledge Project told us the evidence supports the fact that there is no link between MMR vaccines and type 1 diabetes and said conflicting opinion on the issue is based on anecdote. Both show that there is no association between childhood MMR vaccinations and diabetes. For the purposes of that scheme, we’ve rated this claim as a false because there is no link between the MMR vaccine and diabetes (as implied by the post) and diabetes is listed as an ‘adverse reaction’ in the US, which is not the same as a side effect. Four diseases were responsible for 98% of vaccine-preventable deaths: measles, Haemophilus influenzae serotype b, pertussis, and neonatal tetanus. This may be due to financial constraints or to lack of access to the vaccine. After investigation, the EMA had decided that the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks and approved the continuation of the vaccine but advised caution to those who were receiving it. This was decided based on the statistics showing that there were only 19 fatal cases out of more than 25 million people who had already received it worldwide. Many countries in Europe have also resumed administering the vaccine but put restrictions on it. This includes Germany who limited it to people over age 60 and France who limited it to people over \n\nThere are several different formulations of measles-containing vaccines. The MMR vaccine is commonly used and includes protection against measles, mumps, and rubella. The side effects of these vaccines can vary depending on the specific formulation.

It is always recommended to consult with a healthcare professional for specific information about each formulation and its associated side effects.\n\nDetermine whether the given background supports or refutes the claim, and respond with 'SUPPORT' or 'REFUTE'.

Mozambique. The cyclone hit the country about a week after Subtropical Depression Dando struck southern Mozambique, causing flooding and deaths. Initial forecasts suggested that the cyclone would impact South Africa or make landfall in southern Mozambique, but this became less likely as the storm continued tracking south. Nevertheless, some local tourists voluntarily evacuated the coastal city of Inhambane in Mozambique in anticipation of the storm. Flooding also caused a malaria outbreak that killed 45 people in the country. Residents in Mozambique gradually recovered from storm damage in the weeks after it struck. Only two months after the storm struck, however, Cyclone Japhet left damage and deaths in many of the same areas. In neighboring Malawi, the storm's remnants caused \n\n humanitarian crisis unfolded in the wake of the cyclone, with hundreds of thousands of people in urgent need of assistance across Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

The plan anticipated that some of these vaccines will not prove safe or effective, making the program more costly than typical vaccine development, but potentially leading to the availability of a viable vaccine several months earlier than typical timelines. Operation Warp Speed, initially funded with about $10billion from the CARES Act (Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security) passed by the United States Congress on March 27, was an interagency program that includes components of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA); the Department of Defense; private firms; and other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Food and Drug Administration announced on June 30, 2020, that a vaccine would need to be at least 50% effective for diminishing the severity of COVID-19 symptoms to obtain regulatory and marketing approval. Goals\nAccording to the Department of Health and Human Services' fact sheet, the main stated goal of Operation Warp Speed was to \"produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines with the initial doses available by January 2021, as part of a broader strategy to accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics\". Funding was increased to about $18billion by October 2020. Rick Bright, the BARDA director, was reassigned on or about April 22, 2020, following his resistance to (as he phrased it) \"efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections\". The vaccine developers, different vaccine technologies, and treatments receiving government research funding were:\n\nIndirectly-funded companies include:\n\nInovio\n\nAs of October 2020, Operation Warp Speed had spent less than $1billion to support the development and manufacturing of three monoclonal antibody treatments, versus almost $10billion on six vaccines. Other companies involved in the Warp Speed program\n\nPfizer–BioNTech\nThe BioNtech project to develop a novel mRNA technology for a COVID-19 vaccine was called \"Project Lightspeed\", which started in mid-January 2020 at BioNTech's laboratories in Mainz, Germany, just days after the SARS-Cov-2 genetic sequence was first made public. But on July 22, Operation Warp Speed placed an advance-purchase order of $2billion with Pfizer to manufacture 100 million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for use in the United States when the vaccine was shown to be safe, effective, licensed, and authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Company representatives said in November that \"the company is part of Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential coronavirus vaccine,\" and that \"Pfizer is proud to be one of various vaccine manufacturers participating in Operation Warp Speed as a supplier of a potential COVID-19 vaccine.\" Distribution\nVaccine doses purchased by Operation Warp Speed were sent from manufacturers via UPS and FedEx to locations specified by state governments. The Federal Pharmacy Partnership delivers doses to CVS and Walgreens locations, which then send pharmacists for mass vaccinations at care facilities like nursing homes. In October 2020, Alex Azar, at that time the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, predicted a hundred million available doses by the end of the year. The Trump administration later reduced the goal to twenty million doses. The distribution effort was criticized for lack of coordination between federal and state governments, and lack of timely federal funding for mass vaccination campaigns. Reception\n\nCost\nAlthough initially budgeted by Congress for about $10billion in May 2020, Operation Warp Speed had spent $12.4billion by mid-December on vaccine developers for the combined costs of R&D and pre-approval manufacturing for millions of vaccine doses. Operation Warp Speed anticipated that some of these vaccines would not prove safe or effective, making the program more costly than typical vaccine development, but potentially leading to the availability of a viable vaccine several months earlier than typical timelines. The low prices of coronavirus vaccines were attributed to the high amount of research funding provided by Operation Warp Speed: despite preliminary data suggesting that the COVID-19 vaccines subsidized by the plan had higher effectiveness than flu vaccines, vaccine developers set initial pricing in line with those of the annual influenza vaccine. Timeline\nThe goals of the projectto develop, manufacture, and distribute hundreds of millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2020were initially criticized as being unrealistic, based on decades of experience in developing viral infection vaccines which normally require years or decades for assuring the chosen vaccine will not be toxic and have adequate efficacy. Similarly, sufficient timea year or multiple yearsis usually needed to be certain a vaccine has durable efficacy while the virus remains pandemic. Despite extensive previous research attempts to produce safe, effective vaccines against coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, all vaccine candidates for coronavirus infections have failed during clinical research, and no vaccine existed to prevent any coronavirus infection. To prepare for manufacturing and distribution, Operation Warp Speed expended resources and financing before the safety and efficacy results of vaccine candidates were known. In the case of Operation Warp Speed, effective vaccines made by BioNTech in Germany and Pfizer and Moderna were given an emergency use authorization by the FDA in December 2020, established an exceptionally fast development and approval timeline for vaccines granted emergency marketing. Competition\nThere was potential that the Warp Speed project would expend effort and funding in direct competition with publicly-traded American vaccine companies already fully engaged and financed for development. Warp Speed did not partner with Chinese vaccine development organizations, or with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, or the European Commission, which are coordinating and financing international programs for multiple vaccine development, having raised $8billion together from international partners on May4 for a Coronavirus Global Response. On December 8, 2020, President Trump signed an executive order mandating that companies sell vaccine to the US before selling to any other countries (even if they already had contracts with other countries). Concern for equitable access\nThe focus of Operation Warp Speed to deploy approved COVID-19 vaccines first for the American people raised ethical and logistical concerns that access to vaccines outside of the United States may be restricted during 2021, leaving low-to-middle-income countries with no or minimal supply. Concerns were elevated when the Trump administration withdrew its financial support for the WHO and COVAX, and whether the program would participate in international vaccination practices, optimization, and education against vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. In February 2021 after Operation Warp Speed was transitioned to the White House COVID-19 Response Team, the United States pledged to donate any vaccine surplus out of concern for vaccine-poor regions, such as Africa. Failure of the public to have confidence in a new vaccine and refuse vaccination is a global health concern, which increases the risk of further viral spreading that could lead to ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks during 2020–21. A September 2020 survey found that half of American adults surveyed said they would not accept a vaccination if it was available at that time, and three-quarters expressed concerns about the pace of the process and fears that a vaccine might be confirmed before its safety and effectiveness are fully understood. Leader neutrality\nThe leader of the Operation Warp Speed project, Moncef Slaoui, had been a board member of the U.S. vaccine developer, Moderna, and divested his shares in Moderna stock, at a potential personal gain of $10million, raising questions of his neutrality in judging vaccine candidates. Although Slaoui resigned from the Moderna board when named to head Warp Speed, his share value in Moderna stock increased by $3million in one day when Moderna announced an advance in vaccine clinical research. Lawsuits and insider trading\nShareholders sued biotech firm Inovio, claiming the company misled the public when it reported how quickly it had designed the blueprint for its vaccine candidate.
